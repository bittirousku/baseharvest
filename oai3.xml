          <dc:title>Hydrodynamic controls on the movement of invertebrate larvae and organic matter in small streams</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hoover, Trent</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The movement of organisms and resources within ecosystems are essential elements in the productivity, stability, and distribution of communities. This thesis examines how water velocity, a defining factor of lotic systems, influences the dispersion of benthic organisms and particulate organic matter in small stream ecosystems. Variation in movement-related behaviours in two rheophilous (‘flow-loving’) mayflies (Epeorus and Baetis) and two rheophobic (‘flow-avoiding’) mayflies (Ameletus and Paraleptophlebia) were compared to determine how benthic organisms disperse between and within habitat patches in hydrodynamically complex landscapes. The degree to which water velocity and particle shape influence the retention of organic matter (including deciduous leaves, conifer needles, red-cedar fronds, and branch fragments) was examined to determine how physical factors determine detrital resource availability in streams. Although water velocity did not influence the crawling rates of Baetis and Ameletus in daylight conditions, both mayflies dispersed rapidly upstream in low-velocity flows in dark conditions. Drift rates of both mayflies were lower in daylight than dark conditions, and were generally inversely related to their habitat preferences. Escape responses in grazing Epeorus, Baetis, and Ameletus larvae in a range of flow conditions showed that retreat distance was more sensitive than flight initiation distance to variation in water velocity, suggesting that hydrodynamics mediate the risks of predation and the costs of flight in stream systems. Comparisons of the transport distances of live larvae, dead larvae, and passive tracer particles in low and high water velocities showed that drift distance varied substantially among taxa, and that behavioural control over drift distance generally declined as water velocity increased. While organic matter particles generally travelled further in high-velocity reaches, leaves were retained in riffles when they impacted on protruding clasts, while ‘stiff’ particles were retained when they settled into streambed interstices. Leaves placed in high-velocity microhabitats were broken down more slowly than leaves in low-flow areas, likely due to the exclusion of large-bodied detritivores. In conclusion, this thesis supports the view that hydrodynamic forces control trophic interactions and local population dynamics in stream ecosystems by directly altering the physical – and sometimes behavioural – processes of particle entrainment, transport, and deposition.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Laboratory, field and numerical investigations of Holmboe's instability</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tedford, Edmund W.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The instabilities that occur at a sheared density interface are investigated in the laboratory, the Fraser River estuary and with Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). In the laboratory, symmetric Holmboe instabilities are observed during steady, maximal two-layer exchange flow in a long channel of rectangular cross section. Internal hydraulic controls at each end of the channel isolate the subcritical region within the channel from disturbances in the reservoirs. Inside the channel, the instabilities form cusp-like waves that propagate in both directions. The phase speed of the instabilities is consistent with linear theory, and increases along the length of the channel as a result of the gradual acceleration of each layer. This acceleration causes the wavelength of any given instability to increase in the direction of flow. As the instabilities are elongated new instabilities form, and as a consequence, the average wavelength is almost constant along the length of the channel. In the Fraser River estuary, a detailed stability analysis is conducted based on the Taylor-Goldstein (TG) equation, and compared to direct observations in the estuary. We find that each set of instabilities observed coincides with an unstable mode predicted by the TG equation. Each of these instabilities occurs in a region where the gradient Richardson number is less than the critical value of 1/4. Both the TG predictions and echosoundings indicate the instabilities are concentrated either above or below the density interface. These ‘one-sided’ instabilities are closer in structure to the Holmboe instability than to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Although the dominant source of mixing in the estuary appears to be caused by shear instability, there is also evidence of small-scale overturning due to boundary layer turbulence when the tide produces strong near-bed velocities. Many features of the numerical simulations are consistent with linear theory and the laboratory experiments. However, inherent differences be tween the DNS and the experiments are responsible for variations in the dominant wavenumber and amplitude of the wave field. The simulations exhibit a nonlinear ‘wave coarsening’ effect, whereby the energy is shifted to lower wavenumber in discrete jumps. This process is, in part, related to the occurrence of ejections of mixed fluid away from the density interface. In the case of the laboratory experiment, energy is transferred to lower wavenumber by the ‘stretching’ of the wave field by a gradually varying mean velocity. This stretching of the waves results in a reduction in amplitude compared to the DNS. The results of the comparison show the dependence of the nonlinear evolution of a Holmboe wave field on temporal and spatial variations of the mean flow.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Swimming in slime</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pachmann, Sydney</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The purpose of this thesis is to study the problem of a low Reynolds number swimmer that is in very close proximity to a wall or solid boundary in a non- Newtonian fluid. We assume that it moves by propagating waves down its length in one direction, creating a thrust and therefore propelling it in the opposite direction. We model the swimmer as an infinite, inextensible waving sheet. We consider two main cases of this swimming sheet problem. In the first case, the type of wave being propagated down the length of the swimmer is specified. We compare the swimming speeds of viscoelastic shear thinning, shear thickening and Newtonian fluids for a fixed propagating wave speed. We then compare the swimming speeds of these same fluids for a fixed rate of work per wavelength. In the latter situation, we find that a shear thinning fluid always yields the fastest swimming speed regardless of the amplitude of the propagating waves. We conclude that a shear thinning fluid is optimal for the swimmer. Analytical results are obtained for various limiting cases. Next, we consider the problem with a Bingham fluid. Yield surfaces and flow profiles are obtained. In the second case, the forcing along the length of the swimmer is specified, but the shape of the swimmer is unknown. First, we solve this problem for a Newtonian fluid. Large amplitude forcing yields a swimmer shape that has a plateau region following by a large spike region. It is found that there exists an optimal forcing that will yield a maximum swimming speed. Next, we solve the problem for moderate forcing amplitudes for viscoelastic shear thickening and shear thinning fluids. For a given forcing, it is found that a shear thinning fluid yields the fastest swimming speed when compared to a shear thickening fluid and a Newtonian fluid. The difference in swimming speeds decreases as the bending stiffness of the swimmer increases.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>New mechanisms for external field control of microscopic interactions in ultracold gases</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Li, Zhiying</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This Thesis describes new mechanisms for controlling elastic and inelastic collisions of ultracold atoms and molecules with static electromagnetic and laser fields. The dynamical properties of ultracold atoms are usually tuned in experiments by applying an external magnetic field to induce a Feshbach resonance. The work presented in this Thesis demonstrates the possibility of inducing and manipulating Feshbach resonances with electric fields. We discuss in detail the mechanisms of electric-field-induced resonances in ultracold mixtures of alkali metal atoms and demonstrate that electric fields may shift and split the magnetic resonances. We show that electric fields may spin up the collision complex of ultracold atoms and induce anisotropic scattering which may be exploited in experiments on many-body dynamics of ultracold gaseous mixtures. The mechanisms of electric-field-induced resonances described in this Thesis allow for two-dimensional control of inter-particle interactions, leading to total control over ultracold gases. To guide future experiments, we generate accurate interaction potentials for ultracold Li--Rb mixtures by fitting positions and widths of experimentally measured Feshbach resonances. Ultracold atomic and molecular gases can be confined by laser fields in one or two dimensions which produces an optical lattice of ultracold particles. We develop a multichannel scattering theory for collisions of atoms and molecules in two dimensions and explore the effects of the confining laser potential on inelastic and reactive collisions of ultracold atoms and molecules in a 1D optical lattice. We show that ultracold collisions can be controlled in a quasi-2D geometry by varying the orientation of a magnetic field with respect to the confinement plane normal and demonstrate that the threshold energy dependence of cross sections for inelastic collisions in an optical lattice can be tuned by varying the confining potential and the magnetic field. Our results show that applying laser confinement in one dimension may stabilize ultracold systems with large scattering lengths, which may open up interesting opportunities for studies of ultracold controlled chemistry and might lead to a new research direction of ultracold chemistry in restricted geometries.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Metal-insulator transition, orbital symmetries and gaps in correlated oxides : an impurity control approach</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hossain, M. A.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The primary objective of this research is to develop and study newer ways to control electronic properties of correlated oxide systems using impurities. This goal has been achieved by introducing dilute localized 3d Mn impurities in place of a delocalized 4d Ru sites in a 2-dimensional Ru-O matrix and doping an electronically reconstructed polar surface of YBCO via surface impurities. The first part of the work concentrates on X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and Resonant Soft X-ray Scattering (RSXS) studies on lightly Mn doped Sr₃Ru₂O₇ . Our goal is to understand the electronic structure of the material both at room and low temperature and ultimately to understand the mechanism behind the low temperature metal-insulator transition in this compound. With XAS, we zoom into the local electronic structure of the impurities themselves and discovered unusual valence and crystal field level inversion in the Mn impurities. With the help of density functional theory and cluster multiplet calculations, we developed a model to describe the hierarchy of the crystal eld levels of the Mn impurities. Long range magnetic properties of the compound has been probed with Resonant Soft X-ray Scattering (RSXS) on the Mn and Ru L-edges. We have found and analyzed the (¼,¼,0) structurally forbidden diffraction peak and connected it to an antiferromagnetic instability in the parent compound. Doping dependent scattering studies revealed the magnetic structure of the low temperature insulating phase and ultimately the mechanism behind the metal-insulator transition itself. Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) has been used to investigate the low energy electronic structure of underdoped high-Tc superconductor YBCO. It has been revealed that due to the presence of polar surfaces there is electronic reconstruction on the surface of a cleaved YBCO sample. A novel technique has been devised that allows one to control the surface doping level in-situ by evaporating Potassium (K) on the YBCO surface. We showed that K tunes the surface doping level by donating electrons and thereby makes it possible to continuously tune the surface doping level throughout the phase diagram.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Development and characterization of two versions of a new single particle mass spectrometer for organic aerosol analysis that incorporate a 3D ion trap</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Simpson, Emily</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Aerosol particles are ubiquitous throughout the atmosphere and play an important role in human health, climate, and the chemistry of the atmosphere. A significant mass fraction of these particles is composed of organic species, which remain poorly characterized due to the number and diversity of species present. This thesis describes the development and characterization of two versions of a new single particle mass spectrometer with a 3D ion trap for organic aerosol studies. Version I combines CO₂ laser desorption and electron impact ionization in an ion trap. Mass spectra obtained for four species are comparable to NIST EI spectra. Tandem mass spectrometry studies are also demonstrated. The effects of vaporization energy, ionization delay time, and electron pulse width on the mass spectra and fragmentation patterns are examined. The detection limit of the instrument is found to be ~1x10⁸ molecules (350 nm diameter particle) for 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Version II integrates CO₂ laser desorption and tunable VUV ionization in an ion trap and was used for a detailed study of oleyl alcohol, oleic acid and mixtures thereof. Both the degree of fragmentation in the mass spectra and the translational energy of the vaporized molecules are found to vary as a function of desorption energy in the pure particles and as a function of composition in the mixed particles. These changes can be described by the energy absorbed per particle during desorption. We show that these effects hinder the quantitative response of the instrument and have important implications for other two step laser desorption/ionization systems. The final part of this thesis presents preliminary results from atmospherically relevant particles. Mass spectra of cigarette sidestream smoke, fulvic acid, meat cooking, and ammonium bisulfate aerosols are collected using both versions of the instrument. The two step desorption/ionization process only worked for two types of aerosols, while CO₂ only mass spectra were obtained for all four aerosol types. The suitability of CO₂ desorption strongly depended on particle composition, which will affect the applicability of the technique to atmospherically realistic aerosols. The results also suggest that CO₂ only laser desorption/ionization may be useful for field studies.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Measure-driven impulsive systems : stabilization, optimal control and applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Code, Warren Joseph</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This dissertation studies various standard facets of nonlinear control problems in the impulsive setting, using a framework of measure-driven systems. Containing a Borel measure in their dynamics, these systems model significant time scale discrepancies; the measure may weight actions at instants, producing trajectories that mix discrete and continuous dynamics on the "fast" and "slow" time scales, respectively. A central feature of our work is the careful use of a time reparametrization to transform these systems into standard, non-impulsive ones, so that the wealth of recent results in nonlinear control may be applied. Closed-loop stabilization of impulsive control systems containing a measure in the dynamics is addressed. It is proved that, as for regular affine systems, an almost everywhere continuous stabilizing impulsive feedback control law exists for such impulsive systems. An example illustrating the loop closing features is also presented. Necessary conditions for optimal control have recently been developed in the non-convex case by Clarke and Vinter, among others. We extend these results to generalized differential inclusions where a signed, vector-valued measure appears. In particular, we offer a set of stratified necessary conditions in optimal control of measure-driven systems, as well as a set of standard (global) conditions under weak regularity hypotheses on the differential inclusion maps. An auxiliary result essential to our proof extends existing free end-time necessary conditions results to Clarke's stratified framework. We work in the context of pseudo-Lipschitz multifunctions, which provide localized Lipschitz-like properties in the absence of convexity. We take a well-evolved solution concept framework in new directions, introducing a workable system of state-dependent measures and measure-based constraints, such as a forced impulse schedule, a restriction to purely discrete impulse dynamics or a state-dependent impulse restriction, and prove necessary conditions in optimal control for this new framework. This is an important step in the renewed use of measure-driven systems in modeling a broad range of applications within a familiar, mathematically sound framework. Taken together, these results span a broad range of topics in nonlinear, state-space control in the impulsive context, and refresh the measure-driven framework, paving the way for future research and further value in applications.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Surface evolution during gallium arsenide homoepitaxy with molecular beam epitaxy</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Whitwick, Michael Brian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>GaAs grown with MBE is the basis for many useful optoelectric devices. Measurements are presented of the smoothing of patterned and randomly roughened GaAs surfaces during homoepitaxy over a large range of Ga flux, substrate temperatures, arsenic fluxes, and Bi surfactant. The bulk of these measurements were taken by in-situ elastic light scattering or ex-situ AFM. These measurements provide experimental support for a non-linear continuum growth model that has been derived analytically from basic atomic level phenomena that occur in epitaxial film growth. During epitaxial growth the smoothing is observed to change in nature as the surface amplitude decreases. One of the regimes of smoothing is associated with the linear smoothing coefficients from the physically based non-linear continuum growth equation. The temperature and growth rate dependence of the smoothing coefficients are presented and found to be in good agreement with predictions from the continuum growth model. A key parameter in the continuum growth equation, the density of atomic steps, is measured independently using AFM. The step density, which agrees with theoretical predictions, is used to compute smoothing coefficients and is shown to be in agreement with the light scattering measurements. Complex shapes are observed for epitaxial growth on patterned GaAs substrates. Two characteristic surface morphologies were observed. The first is characterized by downward V-shaped cusps and rounded mounds caused by non-linear smoothing. The second morphology is similar, however the symmetry of the surface structure was inverted. This surface morphology has not been previously observed in GaAs. Step edge attachment was found to be the driving mechanism that produced both of these morphologies. Bismuth is observed to act as a surfactant in GaAs homoepitaxy. While Bi assisted growth is found to decrease the overall surface roughness, it is also found to alter the characteristics of the surface morphology. Notably, roughness at low spatial frequency was increased with the addition of Bi, while at high spatial frequency roughness was decreased. Significant changes to the shape evolution of patterned substrate are also observed when Bi is added to GaAs epitaxial growth.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Interfacial dynamics in complex fluids : studies of drop and free-surface deformation in polymer solutions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhou, Diwen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Interfacial flows in complex fluids are an important subject, scientifically rich and technologically important. The main scientific attraction comes from the fact that the microstructure of the bulk fluids may evolve during interfacial flow, and thereby generating non-Newtonian stresses that act on the interface. Thus, interfacial motion and conformation of the microstructure are coupled. Such flow situations arise in many industrial applications, including processing of polymer blends, foaming, and emulsification. In this thesis, I describe three projects aimed at exploring interfacial dynamics of viscoelastic polymeric liquids. The first project consists of finite-element simulations of drop deformation in converging flows in an axisymmetric conical geometry. The moving interface is captured using a diffuse-interface model and accurate interfacial resolution is ensured by adaptive refinement of the grid. The drop experiences a predominantly elongational flow. The amount of deformation sustained by the drop depends, besides the geometry and kinematics of the flow, on the rheology of both the drop and the matrix fluids. The second and third projects concern the same process of selective withdrawal, in which stratified layers of immiscible fluids are withdrawn from a tube placed a certain distance from the interface. We have chosen to work with an air-liquid system, with the suction tube embedded in the Newtonian or viscoelastic liquid. The second project is an experimental study, where we used video recording and imaging processing to analyze how the interfacial deformation is influenced by the non-Newtonian rheology of the liquid. We discover three regimes, subcritical, critical and supercritical. The third project consists of sharp-interface, moving-grid finite-element simulations of selective withdrawal for Newtonian and viscoelastic Giesekus liquids. The experiments and computations are in reasonable agreement. The work of this thesis has led to two main outcomes. The first is a detailed understanding of how viscoelastic stress can lead to unusual and sometimes counter-intuitive effects on interfacial deformation. The second is a potentially important new method for measuring elongational viscosity of low-viscosity liquids. This is worth further investigation considering the poor performance of existing methods.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Magnetic properties near the surface of cuprate superconductors studied using Beta-Detected NMR</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Saadaoui, Hassan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Beta-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (β-NMR) uses highly spin polarized β-emitting nuclei as a probe. Besides its use in nuclear physics, it has also become a powerful and sensitive tool in condensed matter physics and materials science. At TRIUMF, β-NMR of ⁸Li+ has been developed to study materials in a depth-resolved manner, where the implantation depth of ⁸Li+ is controlled via electrostatic deceleration. In this thesis, β-NMR of ⁸Li+ has been used to study high-Tc cuprate superconductors (HTSC). The objective of this work is to search for spontaneous magnetic fields generated by a possible time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) superconducting state near the surface of hole-doped YBa₂Cu₃O₇−d (YBCO), and study the nature of the vortex lattice (VL) in YBCO and electron-doped Pr₂−xCexCuO₄−d (PCCO). For several advantages, our measurements were carried out by implanting ⁸Li+ in thin silver films evaporated on the superconductors. In our TRSB studies, the magnetic field distribution p(B) is measured 8 nm away from the Ag/YBCO interface in magnetic fields B₀ = 5 to 100 G, applied parallel to the interface. p(B) showed significant broadening below the Tc of ab- and c-axis oriented YBCO films. The broadening signals the existence of weak disordered magnetic fields near the surface of YBCO. From the broadening’s temperature and field dependence we draw an upper limit of 0.2 G on the magnitude of spontaneous magnetic fields associated with TRSB. To study the VL, p(B) is measured at average implantation depths ranging from 20 to 90 nm away from the Ag/YBCO or Ag/PCCO interface in B₀ = 0.1 to 33 kG, applied perpendicular to the surface. p(B) showed a dramatic broadening below Tc as expected from the emerging field lines of the VL in the superconductor. In YBCO, p(B) is symmetric and the dependence on B0 is much weaker than expected from an ideal VL, indicating that the vortex density varies across the face of the sample on a long length scale, likely due to vortex pinning at twin boundaries. In PCCO, a 2D VL is established due to the high anisotropy of the superconductor leading to a nearly symmetric p(B).</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A wave equation approach to ultrasound elastography</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Baghani, Ali</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Tissue elastography is a field of medical imaging which deals with obtaining images of tissue mechanical properties, in particular tissue elasticity. Every elastography imaging system has three major components: an exciter, an imaging system, and an image processing software module. The principle of operation of these systems is that softer and harder tissues react differently to a mechanical excitation. The imaging system captures images of the tissue as the mechanical exciter deforms the tissue. The image processing software module then computes the tissue motion from the acquired images, and solves an inverse problem to obtain tissue elasticity from tissue displacements. In ultrasound elastography all three components of the displacement are not available, and the measurement is carried out only on the imaging plane. The problem of inversion using partial measurements is an inherently challenging problem. To solve this problem the phase speed is estimated in the first place. This thesis studies the process of estimating tissue elasticity from tissue displacements, using the phase speed estimation. It is shown that, in general, the elasticity cannot be inferred from the phase speed, but under certain boundary and excitation conditions, a relationship exists between the phase speed and the elasticity. However the relationship depends on the boundary and excitation conditions. Based on the developed results, a novel rheometry method is proposed for visco-elastic characterization of tissue samples. To increase the resolution of the elasticity images it is of interest to use higher frequencies of excitation. However the inherent low frame rate of ultrasound systems posed a limitation. A novel high-frame-rate ultrasound system is introduced which is capable of tracking motions of up to 500Hz. The high-frame-rate system is used in conjunction with the inversion algorithms to form an elastography system. The performance of the system is tested experimentally on tissue mimicking material having hard and soft inclusions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Three-dimensional flow through forming fabrics and the motion of flexible fibres in flow</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Vakil, Ali</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This dissertation addresses the 3D flow through forming fabrics. In the first part of this thesis, the single phase 3D flow through certain specific fabrics was modeled. In practice, the Reynolds number of the fabric flow, based on paper-side filament diameter, is around 100. Consequently, it is not too surprising that the permeability of the fabrics was found to vary approximately as Re ⁻⁰˙⁴, which is intermediate between the expected low Re (Re⁻¹) and high Re (Re⁰) limits. The resistance of a multilayer fabric was found to be nearly equal to the sum of the resistance of each layer considered in isolation. The effect of filament-scale and weave-scale flow non-uniformity on the fiber distribution in the finished paper was considered. For one specific fabric, there was 3 times more chance for short fibers to accumulate initially over openings than blockages of the fabric. Jet-to-wire speed ratio was found to have an insignificant effect on permeability results, but a marked effect on the Machine Direction shear stress in the vicinity of the paper-side filaments. In an attempt to model sheet formation, numerical simulations of the motion of a single fiber in the flow field of a cylinder was carried out as a canonical test case of the fiber/filament interaction system. Seven dimensionless groups govern the problem. A range of dimensionless groups were found for which the fiber hung up on the cylinder, whereas for other values of the dimensionless groups the fiber slid over the cylinder. In general, longer and more flexible fibers had a greater likelihood to be caught by the filament. Yawed finite aspect ratio cylinders at moderate Reynolds numbers are approximate representations of fibers in the flow field of forming fabrics. No analytical solution or any experimental data are reported in the literature to predict the drag and lift force on such particles in such flows. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to find the drag and lift coefficients of inclined finite circular cylinders at Reynolds numbers in the range 1-40. The simulations showed that the Independence Principle was highly inaccurate for low inclination angles.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Rheology of synovial fluid with and without viscosupplements in patients with osteoarthritis : a pilot study</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bhuanantanondh, Petcharatana</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that is characterized by the breakdown of articular cartilage. Over 80% of people over the age of 60 show radiographic evidence of OA. Rheology of synovial fluid is of interest because of its significance in the joint lubrication. However, there are still many questions related to synovial fluid rheology and its relation with OA. Although viscosupplementation has been used as a treatment for OA for many years, its clinical effect remains controversial. Therefore, the purposes of this pilot study were to determine rheological behavior of synovial fluid in patients with OA to better understand its role in joint lubrication, and to determine in vitro the effect of different viscosupplements on the rheological properties of synovial fluid. A detailed rheological characterization of synovial fluid from 22 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty was performed. The results showed that synovial fluid in OA exhibited a non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior and viscoelastic properties. Within an individual, rheological properties of synovial fluid from the left knee differed substantially from the right knee. Moreover, rheopectic behavior (i.e. shear stress increases over time at a constant shear rate) was observed in OA synovial fluid. All three viscosupplements considered in this study (i.e. Orthovisc®, Suplasyn®, and Synvisc®) exhibited a non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior. Within the range of frequency from 0.1 to 10 Hz., Orthovisc® exhibited a linear viscoelastic behavior, whereas Synvisc® and Suplasyn® exhibited a gel-like behavior and a viscous-like behavior, respectively. By adding viscosupplements to OA synovial fluid, the results showed cross linked high molecular weight viscosupplement is more efficient than the non cross-linked ones in improving the overall rheological properties of synovial fluid. Furthermore, rheological properties of synovial fluid mixed with viscosupplements in vitro were nearly unchanged over 2 weeks. In conclusions, synovial fluid in OA exhibited a non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior, viscoelastic properties, and rheopectic behavior. Cross-linked viscosupplement is more efficient than the non cross-linked ones in improving the overall rheological properties of synovial fluid. The rheology of synovial fluid mixed with viscosupplements was nearly unchanged over 2 weeks.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Conditional source-term estimation methods for turbulent reacting flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jin, Bei</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) methods are used to obtain chemical closure in turbulent combustion simulation. A Laminar Flamelet Decomposition (LFD) and then a Trajectory Generated Low-Dimensional Manifold (TGLDM) method are combined with CSE in Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulation of non-premixed autoigniting jets. Despite the scatter observed in the experimental data, the predictions of ignition delay from both methods agree reasonably well with the measurements. The discrepancy between predictions of these two methods can be attributed to different ways of generating libraries that contain information of detailed chemical mechanism. The CSE-TGLDM method is recommended for its seemingly better performance and its ability to transition from autoignition to combustion. The effects of fuel composition and injection parameters on ignition delay are studied using the CSE-TGLDM method. The CSE-TGLDM method is then applied in Large Eddy Simulation of a non-premixed, piloted jet flame, Sandia Flame D. The adiabatic CSE-TGLDM method is extended to include radiation by introducing a variable enthalpy defect to parameterize TGLDM manifolds. The results are compared to the adiabatic computation and the experimental data. The prediction of NO formation is improved, though the predictions of temperature and major products show no significant difference from the adiabatic computation due to the weak radiation of the flame. The scalar fields are then extracted and used to predict the mean spectral radiation intensities of the flame. Finally, the application of CSE in turbulent premixed combustion is explored. A product-based progress variable is chosen for conditioning. Presumed Probability Density Function (PDF) models for the progress variable are studied. A modified version of a laminar flame-based PDF model is proposed, which best captures the distribution of the conditional variable among all PDFs under study. A priori tests are performed with the CSE and presumed PDF models. Reaction rates of turbulent premixed flames are closed and compared to the DNS data. The results are promising, suggesting that chemical closure can be achieved in premixed combustion using the CSE method.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>High electron gain from single walled carbon nanotubes stimulated by interaction with an electron beam</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Michan, Mario</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Carbon nanotubes, hollow cylindrical structures made of carbon atoms with diameters in the order of a few nanometres, are attractive candidates for electron emission applications. A detailed characterization of the phenomenon so-called electron-stimulated field-emission from carbon nanotubes is presented in this thesis. An electron beam hitting the tip of a nanotube biased near the threshold of field-emission can stimulate the emission of a large number of electrons from the nanotube tip. The result of this interaction is that high electron gains can be obtained with very small stimulating electron beam currents. Electron gains of up to 2300 were recorded. This is important as this effect could form the basis of several vacuum nanoelectronic devices. Possible direct and indirect electron-nanotube interaction mechanisms responsible for this high gain are discussed and substantiated through simulations. The design and assembly of an ultra high vacuum apparatus for more controlled future experiments is also presented.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Why be normal? : single crystal growth and X-ray spectroscopy reveal the startlingly unremarkable electronic structure of Tl-2201</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Peets, Darren</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>High-quality platelet single crystals of Tl₂Ba₂CuO₆±δ (Tl-2201) have been grown using a novel time-varying encapsulation scheme, minimizing the thallium oxide loss that has plagued other attempts and reducing cation substitution. This encapsulation scheme allows the melt to be decanted from the crystals, a step previously impossible, and the remaining cation substitution is homogenized via a high-temperature anneal. Oxygen annealing schemes were developed to produce sharp superconducting transitions from 5 to 85 K without damaging the crystals. The crystals' high homogeneity and high degree of crystalline perfection are further evidenced by narrow rocking curves; the crystals are comparable to YSZ-grown YBa₂Cu₃O₆₊δ by both metrics. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) ascertained the crystals' composition to be Tl₁.₉₂₀₍₂₎Ba₁.₉₆₍₂₎Cu₁.₀₈₀₍₂₎O₆₊δ; X-ray diffraction found the composition of a Tc = 75 K crystal to be Tl₁.₉₁₄₍₁₄₎Ba₂Cu₁.₀₈₆₍₁₄₎O₆.₀₇₍₅₎, in excellent agreement. X-ray refinement of the crystal structure found the crystals orthorhombic at most dopings, and their structure to be in general agreement with previous powder data. Cation-substituted Tl-2201 can be orthorhombic, orthorhombic crystals can be prepared, and these superconduct, all new results. X-ray diffraction also found evidence of an as yet unidentified commensurate superlattice modulation. The Tl-2201 crystals' electronic structure were studied by X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopies (XAS/XES). The Zhang-Rice singlet band gains less intensity on overdoping than expected, suggesting a breakdown of the Zhang-Rice singlet approximation, and one thallium oxide band does not disperse as expected. The spectra correspond very closely with LDA band structure calculations, and do not exhibit the upper Hubbard bands arising from strong correlations seen in other cuprates. The spectra are noteworthy for their unprecedented (in the high-Tc cuprates) simplicity. The startling degree to which the electronic structure can be explained bodes well for future research in the cuprates. The overdoped cuprates, and Tl-2201 in particular, may offer a unique opportunity for understanding in an otherwise highly confusing family of materials.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Surface reconstructions during growth of GaAs₁-xBix alloys</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Masnadi Shirazi Nejad, Mostafa</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>GaAs₁-xBix is an exciting new semiconductor alloy with numerous promising applications. Incorporation of Bi into GaAs allows for a large reduction of the GaAs bandgap per percent incorporation (7x greater than In, with modest increase in lattice size) and shows strong photoluminescence (PL) and low material degradation associated with Bi. This will allow for longer wavelength devices to be grown on GaAs substrates, than is currently possible with pseudomorphic InGaAs on GaAs. Since Bi has a strong tendency for surface segregation, the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of GaAs₁-xBix is challenging. To achieve Bi incorporation, this alloy requires unconventional MBE growth conditions such as a low substrate temperature and low As overpressure. The low As:Ga flux ratio also makes Ga and Bi droplet formation a problem. Therefore careful control of growth parameters, especially the As:Ga flux ratio is necessary. In this regard reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) is used as a crucial tool in locating the optimum growth conditions. The surface reconstruction phase map of GaAs₁-xBix is explored in this study as a function of growth temperature and As:Ga ratio. For comparison, the phase map of GaAs, at low temperatures is also obtained. It is observed that the (1×3), (2×3), (2×4) surface phases are common between GaAs and GaAs₁-xBix but due to the presence of Bi, a new (2×1) reconstruction appears in the case of GaAs₁-xBix. This new reconstruction is observed for various Bi fluxes, showing the evolution of this phase with substrate temperature and As:Ga flux ratio. In addition, the emissivity of the (2×1) surface was found to be lower than for the other As-rich reconstructed surfaces (e.g. (1×3) and (2×3) surfaces) which suggests that the (2×1) surface phase is metallic. Throughout this work, several GaAs₁-xBix films were grown with (1×3) and (2×1) reconstructions at different substrate temperatures. Each film is characterized using high-resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence spectra (PL) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Superior crystal quality, higher Bi incorporation and higher intensity PL was observed for GaAs₁-xBix samples grown on (2×1) surfaces, relative to samples grown on (1×3) surfaces.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A direct measurement of pmu xi from muon decay</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bueno, James</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The asymmetry of the positron distribution in polarised muon decay provides confirmation that the weak interaction maximally violates parity conservation. Since 1957 the quantity Pmu xi has been measured with increasing precision, where Pmu is the polarisation of the muon, and xi is a parameter describing the asymmetry. Thus far the results have been consistent with the standard model using a (V-A) interaction. A new measurement of pmu xi using the TRIUMF Weak Interaction Symmetry Test (TWIST) spectrometer is presented in this thesis. The result is pmu xi = 1.00084 +- 0.00035 (stat.) -0.00063,+0.00165 (syst.), which is a factor of 3.2 more precise than a previous TWIST direct measurement, and a factor of 7.0 more precise than the pre-TWIST value. New limits are set on physics beyond the standard model, including the weak decay of right-handed muons, and left-right symmetric models where a (V+A) current is introduced to conserve parity at higher energies.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Optical trapping using a photonic crystal cavity : design and sample fabrication</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mirsadeghi, Seyed Hamed</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A photonic crystal (PC) structure for trapping a 50nm radius dielectric particle at a precise location on a silicon surface in an organic solvent environment has been designed and all of its key components have been fabricated. The high gradient of electric field intensity in a PC cavity mode, with wavelength ~ 1.5 microns, exerts a radiation force toward the center of the cavity. The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) modeling method was used to design a symmetric (input/output) structure that consists of two grating couplers, two parabolic tapered waveguides, two single mode ridge waveguides, two photonic crystal waveguides and a single three-missing-hole (L3) PC cavity. The radiation force on the dielectric sphere was exactly calculated using FDTD simulations to evaluate the Maxwell Stress Tensor (MST) in the presence of the particle to be trapped. This result was compared to that obtained using the simpler dipole approximation, and good agreement between them was found. The fabrication of the structure was done by electron beam lithography and chlorine plasma etching. The Q factors for some of the fabricated samples were measured from the cavity enhanced photoluminescence emission of PbSe quantum dots deposited on the sample surface. A vertical Q factor of 3600 (in vacuum environment) was measured for an isolated cavity, which corresponds to a Qv of 3800 ( in solvent environment) in the FDTD simulations. Also, the Q, of the overall structure (cavity and the waveguides) was measure to be 1050 in vacuum, which from simulations is equivalent to a Q of 1800 in a solvent. These Q values and the resonant frequencies of the modes are in close, but not perfect agreement with the simulation results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A new method for characterizing spindle radial error motion : a two-dimensional point of view</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jamalian, Arash</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents a new two dimensional (2D) method based on complex Fourier series to characterize spindle radial error motions. One subtlety of spindle metrology is that the radial motion measurements have an undesired component caused by the ball installation eccentricity. The current standard methods cannot distinguish between this undesired component and fundamental radial error motion of spindle. The new 2D method identifies what fundamental radial error motion is and how it can be distinguished from the test ball installation eccentricity. Current standard methods give the consequence of radial error motion in two classes of spindle applications, but not the radial error motion itself. By identifying the fundamental radial error motion, the 2D method can not only determine the axis of rotation radial error motion, but also the consequence of error motion in all classes of spindle applications, including a new class of applications with two radial sensitive directions. Experiments are carried out on two types of spindles to confirm that fundamental radial error motion not only exists but it can have a magnitude higher than any other error motion component. The 2D method is used to find the actual radial error motion of the spindles as well as the consequence of error motion in applications. Possible physical causes of the fundamental error motion are also discussed and experiments are carried out to identify their actual effect on the spindles under test.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Viscous fluid instabilities under an elastic sheet</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Khomenko, Maria</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis considers the flow of thin fluid film between an elastic sheet and a rigid plane. We derive a mathematical model for the flow from the Navier-Stokes equations using the lubrication approximation and develop numerical and similarity solutions to this problem. An experimental apparatus was developed to investigate this phenomenon, and the results of the mathematical model were compared with experimental data. Chapter 3 examines the evolution of a fixed fluid volume under gravitational forces on a horizontal plane. The evolution of the fluid mass profile and the progression of the fluid front are determined from the numerical solutions, as well as experimentally. The favourable comparison between the numerical solutions and the experimental results establishes the validity of the model. Chapters 4-5 considers the evolution of a thin fluid flow under an elastic on an inclined plane. We establish a traveling wave solution for this flow. A linear stability analysis yields the criterion for the existence of unstable modes and establishes the growth rate and wavelength of the most unstable mode. Instability is promoted by increasing the inclination of the plane. For low angles, the numerical and experimental growth rates were in good agreement, while the wavelengths were experimentally of the same order and numerically computed wavelengths had little variation. The long term behaviour of the fluid front is studied analytically via a similarity solution in Chapter 6.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Pipe flow of homogeneous slurry</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hallbom, Donald John</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The objective of this Thesis is to devise a system for the "rheology-based design" of non-settling (homogeneous) slurry pipelines that is more conducive to application by practicing engineers without impairing its accuracy or utility for research purposes. The cornerstone is the development of a new rheological model and constitutive equation for homogeneous slurry based on the aggregation/deaggregation of the suspended mineral particles. This “yield plastic” model is shown to describe a family of models that includes the Newtonian, Bingham plastic and Casson models as special cases. It also closely approximates the results of many consistency models, including power law, yield power law, Cross and Carreau-Yasuda. The yield plastic model is then used to develop design equations to determine the pressure-gradient of laminar and turbulent pipe flow. A relative energy dissipation criterion is proposed for the laminar-turbulent transition and shown to be consistent with currently used transition models for Newtonian and Bingham fluids. Finally, a new dimensionless group (the “stress number”) is proposed that is directly proportional to the pressure-gradient and independent of the velocity. When the design equations are presented graphically in terms of the stress number and the plastic Reynolds number, the resulting “design curve diagram” is shown to be a dimensionless (pressure-gradient vs. velocity) pipe flow curve. The net result is that the hydraulic design of homogeneous slurry systems only requires the use of a single constitutive equation and three engineering design equations. The results are presented in a conceptually easy form that will foster an intuitive understanding of non-Newtonian pipe flow. This will assist engineers to understand the impact of slurry rheology when designing, operating and troubleshooting slurry pipelines and, in the future, other slurry related processes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Micro flow control using thermally responsive polymer solutions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bazargan, Vahid</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Microfluidics refers to devices and methods for controlling and manipulating fluid flows at length scales less than a millimeter. Miniaturization of a laboratory to a small device, usually termed as lab-on-a-chip, is an advanced technology that integrates a microfluidic system including channels, mixers, reservoirs, pumps and valves on a micro scale chip and can manipulate very small sample volumes of fluids. While several flow control concepts for microfluidic devices have been developed to date, here flow control concepts based on thermally responsive polymer solutions are presented. In particular, flow control concepts base on the thermally triggered reversible phase change of aqueous solutions of the polymer Pluronic will be discussed. Selective heating of small regions of microfluidic channels, which leads to localized gel formation in these channels and reversible channel blockage, will be used to control a membrane valve that controls flow in a separate channel. This new technology will allow generating inexpensive portable bioanalysis tools where microvalve actuation occurs simply through heaters at a constant pressure source without a need for large external pressure control systems as is currently the case. Furthermore, a concept for controlled cross-channel transport of particles and potentially cells is presented that relies on the continuous regeneration of a gel wall at the diffusive interface of two co-streaming fluids in a microfluidic channel.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>In situ analysis of lateral triterpenoid distribution in plant cuticular waxes using Raman microspectroscopy and non-linear optical imaging</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yu, Marcia Mei Lin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The above-ground organs of plants are covered by a protective cuticle, an extracellular membrane performing important physiological and ecological functions, that consists of cuticular wax and the fatty acid-derived polymer cutin. Until the past decade, the cuticular wax was thought to be a homogenous mixture. Hence, previous interpretations relating the chemical composition and biological functions of the cuticular wax were based on the total wax composition, an average taken over the entire area and depth of the cuticle. However, recent selective sampling experiments showed a heterogeneity of the chemical composition between different wax layers. The finding of this heterogeneity imposes the need for a more accurate description of the cuticle in order to understand how the chemical composition determines the biological function. This thesis is aimed at mapping the lateral patterns of cuticular waxes on Prunus laurocerasus leaf surfaces with microscopic resolution to provide spatially resolved chemical information in the interest of describing the cuticle more accurately. Firstly, this thesis examines the post-acquisitional data processing and analysis techniques followed by the investigation of the potential of Raman microspectroscopy for the simultaneous detection of structurally similar triterpenoids in plant cuticles. Relative composition analysis was performed on artificial triterpenoid mixtures and the resulting calculated triterpenoid ratios were consistent with the expected values. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the linear near infrared (NIR) Raman, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), and third harmonic generation (THG) spectra of isolated adaxial and abaxial P. laurocerasus cuticles demonstrated the in situ detectability of the triterpenoids using this approach. Raman maps of the adaxial cuticle showed that the triterpenoids accumulate to relatively high concentrations over the periclinal regions of the pavement cells, while the very long chain aliphatic wax constituents are distributed fairly evenly across the entire adaxial cuticle. In the analysis of the abaxial cuticles, the triterpenoids were found to accumulate in greater amounts over the guard cells relative to the pavement cells. The very long chain aliphatic compounds accumulated in the cuticle above the anticlinal cell walls of the pavement cells, and were found at low concentration above the periclinals and the guard cells. The main research contributions include evaluating various data processing techniques as candidates for automated implementation and applying different imaging techniques to obtain chemical information about the lateral concentration gradient of the triterpenoid components in the cuticles, with high spatial resolution. This thesis also provides the first direct (i.e. in situ) evidence for lateral spatial heterogeneity of triterpenoids in the cuticle of a model species, P. laurocerasus. This work is expected to impel further structure-function investigation of the cuticular membranes of plants.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Viscoelastic flows within eccentric rotating cylinders : journal bearings</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Liu, Kai</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Experiments have shown that the addition of small amounts of long-chained polymer additives to a Newtonian fluid produces desirable lubricants. Additives added to oil make the fluid viscoelastic. The effect of viscoelasticity on lubrication characteristics has recently taken on added significance with the move to yet lower-viscosity lubricants for improved energy efficiency. Any factor influencing load-bearing capacity and wear is clearly of renewed importance. The general trend towards the usage of high performance lubricants and environmentally friendly products also support the design of new lubricants. This thesis is aimed at investigating viscoelastic flows within eccentric rotating cylinders (practical application - journal bearings) using a commercial finite element software POLYFLOW. Numerous validations are performed and excellent agreements are achieved. Steady shear and small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) experiments are performed for specific lubricants including mineral-based and bio-based lubricants to characterize their rheological behavior. Experimental data are fitted by a viscoelastic constitutive model used for numerical simulations. The effects of fluid viscoelasticity between eccentric rotating cylinders on the flow field and on the lubrication performances are revealed in 2D and 3D respectively. From 2D investigation, an increased load capacity on the inner cylinder is found to be achieved by increasing the viscoelasticity of flow. For the first time, to our knowledge, 3D results for an UCM (Upper-Convected Maxwell) fluid at steady state are presented and the flow patterns along the axial direction within the eccentric rotating cylinders are investigated. The viscoelastic effects of those lubricants on the journal bearing performances are revealed and compared at various temperatures. The modeling and numerical simulations used to predict the flow of lubricant in a journal bearing can generate important economic benefits. This research will lead to advanced predictive tools that can be used to improve the design of journal bearing and to propose new economically viable and environmentally friendly lubricants.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantitative field constraints on the dynamics of silicic magma chamber rejuvenation and overturn</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bain, Amelia Anne</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A number of recent papers by Bachmann and co-authors investigate a hypothesis that the catastrophic eruption of large-volume, crystal-rich silicic magmas is a consequence of reheating (so-called rejuvenation) and overturn of partially molten, buoyant silicic material by repeated injection of dense, hot mafic magma. In support of this model, we analyse an extensive suite of kinematic indicators for the buoyant overturn of silicic crystal mush layers of the Coastal Maine Magmatic Province, apparently in response to the injection and cooling of hot, dense mafic magmas. We use spectral analysis, microtextural analysis and scaling theory to identify, characterise and understand the length-scales of deformation along sharp interfaces separating mafic and silicic intrusive layers, from the scale of individual crystals (~1 cm) to in excess of the mafic layer thickness (&gt;100 m). Deformations at the largest scale lengths are comparable to the silicic layer thickness, consistent with Rayleigh-Taylor theory, and support a conjecture that mafic recharge can cause large-scale overturning of silicic magma chambers. By contrast, deformations at the scale of crystals probably record buoyancy effects related to melt percolation and intermediate scales are explained by compaction. The evolution of rejuvenation is investigated and a condition for large-scale overturn of the chamber is proposed. This work provides the first field-based confirmation of the rejuvenation-overturn hypothesis. Additional laboratory experiments addressing the overturn of a particle-rich buoyant fluid layer overlain by a denser fluid layer are outlined in Appendix C.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Enhancing the robustness of ESPI measurements using digital image correlation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bingleman, Luke</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) provides a sensitive technique for measuring surface deformations. The technique involves comparison of the speckle phase angles within surface images measured before and after material deformation. This phase angle comparison requires that the speckle positions be consistent in all images. A lateral shift between images by just one pixel substantially degrades ESPI measurements, while a shift of two or more pixels typically causes complete speckle decorrelation and compromises the measurement entirely. To prevent such lateral motions, the specimen and the optical system must be rigidly fixed. This requirement typically prevents use of the ESPI method in applications outside laboratories or where it is necessary to remove the specimen from the optical setup between ESPI measurements. Here, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is used to track speckle motion caused by specimen displacement between ESPI measurements. The measured images can then be mathematically shifted to restore the original speckle locations, thereby recorrelating the ESPI measurements. Examples are presented where ESPI measurements are successfully made with specimen shifts in excess of 60 pixels. A novel ESPI measurement technique where the specimen is removed in between ESPI measurements is also developed and validated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Chirped-pulse laser amplifier and passive enhancement cavity for generation of extreme ultraviolet light</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lam, Matthew Hon C</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light has many potential applications, including spectroscopy and scattering experiments in physical chemistry and atmospheric science. The dominant method for producing high-flux coherent radiation in this spectral range is synchrotron radiation produced from highly subscribed national-scale facilities such as the Canadian Light Source. An alternative to synchrotron radiation is high harmonic generation (HHG), a nonlinear optical process requiring high optical intensities. This thesis describes the development of an optical amplifier and passive enhancement cavity in order to realize a table-top EUV source. A chirped-pulse ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier system outputs 20 W average power from an initial mode-locked laser outputting pulses at 80 MHz and 160 mW average power. The pulses, of duration ~250 fs after the amplifier, are coupled to a high-finesse cavity which further increases the power by a factor of 500. The peak intensity achieved in the cavity is over 10¹⁴ W/cm² and is an order of magnitude above the intensity required to drive HHG in xenon gas.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Finding conservation laws for partial differential equations</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wan, Andy Tak Shik</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, we discuss systematic methods of finding conservation laws for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). We first review the direct method of finding conservation laws. In order to use the direct method, one first seeks a set of conservation law multipliers so that a linear combination of the PDEs with the multipliers will yield a divergence expression. Once a set of conservation law multipliers is determined, one proceeds to find the fluxes of the conservation law. As the solution to the problem of finding conservation law multipliers is well-understood, in this thesis we focus on constructing the fluxes assuming the knowledge of a set of conservation law multipliers. First, we derive a new method called the flux equation method and show that, in general, fluxes can be found by at most computing a line integral. We show that the homotopy integral formula is a special case of the line integral formula obtained from the flux equations. We also show how the line integral formula can be simplified in the presence of a point symmetry of the PDE system and of the set of conservation law multipliers. By examples, we illustrate that the flux equation method can derive fluxes which would be otherwise difficult to find. We also review existing known methods of finding fluxes and make comparison with the flux equation method.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Parametric subharmonic instability and the β-effect</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chan, Ian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Parametric subharmonic instability (PSI) is a nonlinear interaction between a resonant triad of waves, in which energy is transferred from low wavenumber, high frequency modes to high wavenumber, low frequency modes. In the ocean, PSI is thought to be one of the mechanisms responsible for transferring energy from M₂ internal tides (internal gravity waves with diurnal tidal frequency) to near-inertial waves (internal gravity waves with frequency equal to the local Coriolis frequency) near the latitude of 28.9 degrees. Due to their small vertical scale, near-inertial waves generate large vertical shear and are much more efficient than M₂ internal tides at generating shear instability needed for vertical mixing, which is required to maintain ocean stratification. The earlier estimate of the time-scale for the instability is an order of magnitude larger than the time-scale observed in a recent numerical simulation (MacKinnon and Winters) (MW). An analytical model was developed by (Young et al. 2008) (YTB), and their findings agreed with the MW estimation; however as YTB assumed a constant Coriolis force, the model cannot explain the intensificaiton of PSI near 28.9 degrees as observed in the model of MW; in addition, the near-ineartial waves can propagate a significant distance away from the latitude of 28.9 degrees. This thesis extends the YTB model by allowing for a linearly varying Coriolis parameter (β-effect) as well as eddy diffusion. A linear stability analysis shows that the near-inertial wave field is unstable to perturbations. We show that the β-effect results in a shortening in wave length as the near-inertial waves propagate south; horizontal eddy diffusion is therefore enhanced to the south, and limits the meridional extent of PSI. The horizontal diffusion also affects the growth rate of the instability. A surprising result is that as the horizontal diffusion vanishes, the system becomes stable; this can be demonstrated both analytically and numerically. Mathematically, the β-effect renders the spatial differential operator nonnormal, which is characterized with the aid of pseudo-spectra. Our results suggest the possibility of large amplitude transient growth in near-inertial waves in regimes that are asymptotically stable to perturbations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Simulating viscous incompressible fluids with embedded boundary finite difference methods</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Batty, Christopher</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The behaviour of liquids and gases ranks among the most familiar and yet complex physical phenomena commonly encountered in daily life. To create a seamless approximation of the real world, it is clear that we must be able to accurately simulate fluids. However, a crucial element of what makes fluid behaviour so complex and compelling is its interactions with its surroundings. To simulate the motion of a fluid we cannot consider the Navier-Stokes equations in isolation; we must also examine the boundary conditions at the point where the fluid meets the world. Enforcing these boundary conditions has traditionally been a source of tremendous difficulty. Cartesian grid-based methods typically approximate the world in an unrealistic, axis-aligned block representation, while conforming mesh methods frequently suffer from poor mesh quality and expensive mesh generation. This thesis examines the use of embedded boundary finite difference methods to alleviate these shortcomings by providing a degree of sub-grid information that enables more efficient, flexible, accurate, and realistic simulations. The first key contribution of the thesis is the use of a variational approach to derive novel embedded boundary finite difference methods for fluids, by exploiting the concept of natural boundary conditions. This idea is applied first to animate the interaction between incompressible fluids and irregularly shaped dynamic rigid bodies. I then apply a similar technique to properly handle viscous free surfaces, enabling realistic buckling and coiling in viscous flows. Lastly, I unify these ideas to simulate Stokes flows in the presence of both free surface and solid boundaries, and demonstrate the method's convergence on a range of examples. The second main contribution is a study of embedded boundary methods for pressure projection in the context of unstructured Delaunay and Voronoi meshes. By eliminating the need for boundary-conforming meshes, this work enables efficient high-quality adaptive mesh generation and improves simulation accuracy. Furthermore, it demonstrates that by placing simulation samples at Voronoi sites, and choosing these sites intelligently with respect to liquid geometry, one can eliminate surface noise, improve the realism and stability of surface tension, and plausibly simulate nearly arbitrarily thin sheets and droplets.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Linear and nonlinear vibration response of thin rotating disks</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>MohammadHasani Khorasany, Ramin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Spinning disks have substantial applications in today’s industries (e.g., saw mill industries). Developing a greater understanding the dynamics of spinning disks is a central topic for this thesis. Specifically, this thesis investigates the linear and nonlinear vibrations of spinning disks. In some of the spinning disk applications, the disks may experience a rigid body translational degree of freedom. Having this degree of freedom can change the stability characteristics of spinning disks. Using analytical techniques and a two-mode approximation, the stability characteristics of elastically guided spinning disks having a rigid body translational degree of freedom are thus studied. The effect of axisymmetric non-flatness on the frequency behaviour of spinning disks is also studied. The equations of motion are based on Von Karman plate theory. Assuming that the shape of initial runout is in the form of mode shapes with zero nodal diameters, the equations of motion are then discretized. Neglecting higher order terms, the equations are linearized and the effects of different levels of initial runout on the dynamics of spinning disks are thus studied. Using experimental measurements, the effects of large deformations on the frequency behaviour and amplitude of response for the spinning disks are investigated. Disks with different thicknesses are used in this study. The disks were under the application of a space fixed external force which can produce different levels of nonlinearity. By measuring the disk displacement and conducting FFT analyses, the frequencies were measured for different levels of initial deflection. In order to see how the geometrical nonlinear terms affect the frequency behaviour of spinning disks, the nonlinear governing equations are discretized and then solved to find the equilibrium solutions. By assuming a small perturbation around the equilibrium solution, the nonlinear equations of motion are linearized. Using the linearized form of the equations of motion, the effect of large deformations of the frequency characteristics of spinning disks is analyzed. The analytical results are then compared with the experimentally obtained results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Precision electrodynamics of unconventional superconductors : microwave spectroscopy and penetration depth</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bobowski, Jake Stanley</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Precision measurements of the electrodynamics of unconventional superconductors are reported. Measurements of the magnetic penetration depth temperature dependence are made via cavity perturbation and a novel microwave spectrometer gives the surface resistance continuously from 0.05 to 26.5 GHz. The microwave conductivity of single crystals of YBa₂Cu₃O₆.₅₀ has been measured using the broadband spectrometer. Conductivity spectra were measured after preparing the crystal in the ortho-II phase in which the Cu-O chain oxygens are ordered into alternating full and empty chains. These spectra exhibit features expected for quasiparticle scattering from dilute weak impurities in a d-wave superconductor. The measurements were repeated after reducing the degree of oxygen order in the Cu-O chains. The disordered spectra retain the weak-limit scattering features, however, increased quasiparticle scattering broadens the widths. The conductivity of a new generation of samples, with an order of magnitude lower impurity concentrations, are unchanged from those of the older generation samples. In both generations of crystals the spectral widths are largely determined by residual disorder in the chains. The electrodynamics of single crystal Ba₀.₇₂K₀.₂₈Fe₂As₂ and Ba(Fe₀.₉₅Co₀.₀₅)₂As₂ have been investigated. Measurements of ∆⋌(T)are used to extract the superfluid density ⋌²(0)/⋌²(T) which is observed to approach Tc linearly indicative of mean-field behaviour. At low-temperatures, the superfluid density obeys the a power law ⋌²(0)/⋌²(T)= 1 - (T/T*)n with n varying from 2.1 to 2.7 for the three crystals studied. At T/Tc ≈ 0.04, all three samples exhibit a step-like feature of order 1 anstrom in the measured penetration depth that is of unknown origin. The surface resistance of two Ba₀.₇₂K0.₂₈Fe₂As₂ crystals reveal a sample-dependent extrinsic loss. The spectra, however, share a common temperature dependence and follow frequency squared when the extrinsic loss is removed. This frequency dependence translates to a flat quasiparticle conductivity and implies a high scattering rate(～ 200 GHz). The microwave spectroscopy of a Ba(Fe₀.₉₅Co₀.₀₅)₂As₂ sample reveals more anomalous behaviour. Even after subracting of the extrinsic loss, the surface resistance rapidly increases when the frequency scaled by Tc is above 0.04. The resistivity of the Ba(Fe₀.₉₅Co₀.₀₅)₂As₂ sample is an order of magnitude larger than that of the K-doped samples suggesting the anomalous behaviour may be activated by enhanced impurity concentrations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Holographic condensed matter theories and gravitational instability</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>He, Jianyang</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The AdS/CFT correspondence, which connects a d-dimensional field theory to a (d+1)-dimensional gravity, provides us with a new method to understand and explore physics. One of its recent interesting applications is holographic condensed matter theory. We investigate some holographic superconductivity models and discuss their properties. Both Abelian and non-Abelian models are studied, and we argue the p-wave solution is a hard-gapped superconductor. In a holographic system containing Fermions, the properties of a non-Fermi liquid with a Fermi surface are found. We show that a Landau level structure exists when external magnetic field is turned on, and argue for the existence of Fermi liquid when using the global coordinate system of AdS. Finite temperature results of the Fermion system are also given. In addition, a gravitational instability interpreted as a bubble of nothing is described, together with its field theory dual.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The influence of interference on the Kondo effect</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Malecki, Justin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The Kondo effect, wherein a local magnetic moment is screened via interactions with a continuum of quantum excitations, occurs in quantum dots with an odd number of electrons. By placing a quantum dot in an Aharanov-Bohm interferometer, one is able to probe the effects of electron interference on the manifestation of the Kondo effect. In this thesis, we present a theoretical study of the Kondo effect in a model system of a quantum dot embedded in an Aharanov-Bohm interferometer connected to two conducting leads. By transforming to the scattering basis of the direct inter-lead tunneling, we are able to describe precisely how the Kondo screening of the dot spin occurs. We calculate the Kondo temperature and zero-temperature conductance and find that both are influenced by the Aharanov-Bohm interferometer as well as the electron density in the leads. We also calculate the form of an additional potential scattering term that arises at low energies due to the breaking of particle-hole symmetry. In addition to these analytic results, a numerical renormalization group analysis of the system is presented. We fully describe the influence of the Aharanov-Bohm interferometer on the renormalization group flow of the quantum dot model and obtain strong support for the derived form of the Kondo temperature. A method for extracting the phase shifts of the strong-coupling fixed point from the numerical data is described. These phase shifts are compared with those derived analytically, providing further support for our conclusions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Relative stability in critical collapse of scalar fields with angular momentum</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Akbarian Kaljahi, Arman</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We study numerically the gravitational collapse of two massless scalar fields in spherical symmetry using an approach which incorporates some of the effects of angular momentum. Each field is characterized by a distinct angular momentum parameter, l, with l = 0, 1, 2, ., and has distinct equations of motion. We focus on black critical behaviour, in which we look for solutions, and the properties thereof, that represent the onset of black hole formation in parametrized families of initial data. Although many different critical solutions have been discovered since the early 1990's, almost all work has involved a single matter source, and by coupling more than one type of matter to the gravitational field, new and interesting questions arise. In particular, we consider the issue of the relative stability of the critical solutions in our model, in which we look for signs of instability of one field in the presence of the critical solution associated with the other. Our main result is that fields corresponding to larger values of l appear to be unstable in the context of lower-l critical solutions. This implies that in a two-field universe, the field with larger l would always dominate at precise criticality.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Mesospheric dynamics and ground-layer optical turbulence studies for the performance of ground-based telescopes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pfrommer, Thomas</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Modern astronomical instrumentation employs adaptive optics (AO) systems that correct for atmospheric distortion in real time in order to produce sharper images. The design and performance of these systems relies on the knowledge of the atmosphere both at low and high altitude. This thesis investigates the first kilometer of the atmosphere, the ground layer (GL), as well as the sodium layer at ~92 km. Newly-designed lunar scintillometers provide turbulence profiles of the GL, and high spatio-temporally resolved sodium profiles are obtained using a newly-designed lidar system for UBC's 6-m liquid-mirror. For ground layer adaptive optics systems, knowledge of the local height- and time-resolved GL turbulence is crucial to link local topography to optical turbulence and has been obtained with the help of three lunar scintillometers deployed in Chile, Hawaii and in the Canadian High Arctic. Results from measurements inside the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) dome indicate severe degradation of image quality due to a poorly vented dome and thus provide input for dome modifications. The outside median GL seeing was determined to be 0.48±0.01". Initial results from the Arctic show exceptional GL seeing conditions, better than have been found anywhere on Earth although data quantity is limited. Extremely large telescopes must correct not only for GL turbulence, but also higher atmospheric disturbances in the troposphere. The use of laser guide stars (LGS) increases sky coverage and the field of view, but relies on resonantly excited sodium atoms in the mesosphere. Upper atmospheric dynamics causes varying sodium density, which produces focus-induced wavefront errors in LGS AO systems. The UBC lidar system was built, and its high-resolution data reveal large spatial variability, strong nightly variations and meteor spikes in sodium density on sub-second time scales. The mean altitude power spectrum has been extended to scales approaching the dissipation limit, and its spectral index of -1.95±0.12 and normalization of 30±20 m²/Hz determines AO system wavefront errors of 4 nm for a 30 m, and 8 nm for a 42 m telescope per meter mean-altitude variation. Derived mean altitudes, separated by one arcmin, showed rms fluctuations of order 30 m and could cause AO performance degradation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hydrodynamics of circular free-surface long water jets in industrial metal cooling</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Seraj, Mohammad Mohsen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Control cooling in run-out table (ROT) is crucial in managing the properties of steel strip. However, industries still rely on experience and empirical methods due to the complexity and transient nature of cooling process. The associated flow features of ROT cooling received little attention in the literature. The main purpose of this research is to investigate systematically the hydrodynamics of long circular water jets impinging on fixed and moving plate with industrial scale. The fixed plate experiments showed that the impingement film and circular hydraulic jump were disturbed with surface waves and splattering. The experiments on moving plate with single impinging jet demonstrated the effect of jet flow rate and plate speed on wetting zone. For a given plate velocity, the size of wetting area increased according to jet Reynolds number. The moving impingement surface interferes with radial spreading film and the wetting front became noncircular. A new correlation for the radius of wetting front has been proposed. The effect of plate motion on liquid jets interactions were studied experimentally using multiple jets. Nonsplashing thick interaction film or thin upwash splashing fountain at the interaction zone were observed depending on process parameters. If the effect of plate motion was not promoted then the interaction flow structure was preserved similar to stationary plate. However, the moving plate could change the strong splashing fountain interaction flow to nonsplashing thick film depending on the velocity ratio of plate to jet for a given nozzle space. Higher plate speeds and/or lower jet flow rates are more likely to decrease splashing and change the fountain type interaction. Numerical simulations on stationary surface demonstrated that suggested velocity and pressure variation for short laminar jets may be adapted for long turbulent liquid jets if the gravity is considered. Generally, shear-stress transport k-ω model showed better performance after impingement. The moving plate simulations of single jet proved the distortion of the impingement zone. The shifted stagnation point produces noncircular impingement region and unsymmetrical spreading of impingement water film over the surface. Longitudinal negative velocity was occurred at higher plate velocity simulations which represent the backwash flow.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The measurement of the rare kaon decay k-plus to pi-plus, neutrino and anti-neutrino</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ives, Joss</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Brookhaven National Laboratory experiment E949 was designed to search for the rare K meson decay K⁺ → π⁺ , neutrino, and anti-neutrino, a decay sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. While previous data analyses dealt with the high π⁺ momentum region accessible for this reaction, this thesis concentrates on the lower range between 140 and 199 MeV/c. Analysis of this low π⁺ momentum region was performed to search for additional evidence of the process K⁺ → π⁺, neutrino, and anti-neutrino. A blind analysis technique was used to avoid bias when developing the selection criteria used to suppress the competing background processes. The blind analysis technique was based on identifying background sources a priori and only examining the signal region once all selection criteria and background estimates had been finalized. The background estimates were performed using a technique known as a "bifurcation method", which relied on using two uncorrelated selection criteria to suppress each background source. The analysis of an exposure of 1.71 x 10¹² K⁺ decays resulted in an observation of three events with an estimated background of 0.927 ± 0.168(stat.)⁺³²⁰-₀.₂₃₇(sys.) events and a single event sensitivity of (4.28 ± 0.43)x 10-¹⁰. Using a likelihood method, the three candidate events observed here were combine with the previous E787 and E949 results, yielding a branching ratio of ϐ(K⁺ → π⁺, neutrino, and anti-neutrino decay of (1.73+1.15-1.05) x 10⁻¹⁰ at the 68% confidence level. This branching ratio is consistent with the prediction of the Standard Model, (0.85 ± 0.07) x 10⁻¹⁰.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>MultiFLIP for energetic two-phase fluid simulation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Boyd, William Landon</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Physically-based liquid animations often ignore the influence of air, giving up interesting behaviour. We present a new method which treats both air and liquid as incompressible, more accurately reproducing the reality observed at scales relevant to computer animation. The Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) method, already shown to effectively simulate incompressible fluids with low numerical dissipation, is extended to two-phase flow by associating a phase bit with each particle. The liquid surface is reproduced at each time step from the particle positions, which are adjusted to prevent mixing near the surface and to allow for accurate surface tension. The liquid surface is adjusted around small-scale features so they are represented in the grid-based pressure projection, while separate, loosely coupled velocity fields reduce unwanted influence between the phases. The resulting scheme is easy to implement, requires little parameter tuning and is shown to reproduce lively two-phase fluid phenomena.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electronic states and transport in GaNAs and GaAsBi</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Beaton, Daniel A.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>ct: This thesis explores the effect of incorporation of nitrogen or bismuth in GaAs on electronic states and transport, namely shallow in-gap states associated with nitrogen clusters in GaNAs and the hole mobility in GaAsBi. Lowered in-gap emission intensity in GaNAs epi-layers grown in under atomically rich operation of the plasma source indicates that atomic nitrogen results in more optically efficient GaNxAs1-x films. Two significant additions made to the growth procedure of GaAsBi allowed for growth of thick, doped epi-layers: reduced growth rate and growth interrupt prior to the GaAsBi epi-layer. Hole mobility is found to decrease with increasing Bi concentration. This decrease is smaller than the analogous decrease of electron mobility in GaNAs. The temperature dependence of the hole mobility is modelled using terms for scattering from phonons, ionized impurities and a temperature independent bismuth related term. There is an increasing effect from the bismuth related term with increasing bismuth content. Calculation of the scattering cross-section based on the fitted coefficient for the 1% GaAsBi sample is in good agreement with a theoretically predicted value. For samples above 4.4% the hole mobility was found to be temperature independent and scattering cross-sections are more than an order of magnitude larger. These are indications that bismuth clusters play a significant role in reducing the hole mobility at high concentrations. GaAs, GaNAs and GaAsBi were incorporated in to device structures: Schottky diodes and p-i-n LEDs. Several defects were detected using DLTS and an increasing trend of defects for decreasing growth temperature found. Two hole traps were found to be related to growth of GaNAs, where only one was related to nitrogen incorporation. The device structure of the LEDs prevented an in-depth analysis and poor surface morphology of GaAsBi epi-layers resulted in leaky devices. While further work is required, it was found that the inclusion of a growth interrupt introduced many shallow traps. Optical measurements on the LEDs showed that the electroluminescence from the GaAsBi layer was temperature insensitive, while the emission from the GaAs layers followed the expected Varshni relation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Initial data for axially symmetric black holes with distorted apparent horizons</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tonita, Aaryn</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The production of axisymmetric initial data for distorted black holes at a moment of time symmetry is considered within the (3+1) context of general relativity. The initial data is made to contain a distorted marginally trapped surface ensuring that, modulo cosmic censorship, the spacetime will contain a black hole. The resulting equations on the complicated domain are solved using the piecewise linear finite element method which adapts to the curved surface of the marginally trapped surface. The initial data is then analyzed to calculate the mass of the space time as well as an upper bound on the fraction of the total energy available for radiation. The families of initial data considered contain no more than few percent of the total energy available for radiation even in cases of extreme distortion. It is shown that the mass of certain initial data slices depend to first order on the area of the marginally trapped surface and the gaussian curvature of prominent features.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Modeling polarons in transition-metal oxides</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lau, Bayo</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This work is a series of reports on progress in the description of electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions in transition-metal oxides, with an emphasis to the class of high-Tc superconducting cuprates. Combinations of numerical and analytical approaches were devised and developed to study large-scale models, which distinguish cation and anion sites of the realistic lattice structure. The many results range from incremental deviation to significant difference compared to those of the widely-accepted simple models without such distinction. A previously proposed numerical scheme and a perturbation approach were adapted to study the one-dimensional breathing-mode model, which describes a charge carrier interacting with vibrating anions. The effort yielded the first accurate benchmark result for all parameters values of the model. Based on a physical insight about the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a two-dimensional square lattice, an octapartite approach was devised to model the low-energy states. The efficiency of the resulting numerical approach was showcased with the explicit solution to a record-breaking 64-spin torus. A spin-polaron model was derived to model holes injected into cuprate's quasi two-dimensional copper-oxygen layer. Total-spin-resolved exact diagonalization was performed for a single fermionic hole in a record-breaking cluster with 32 copper and 64 oxygen sites. The solutions revealed important physics missed by previous studies. The octapartite approach was then developed to solve the spin-polaron model with two extra holes in the same cluster. The accuracy and efficiency of the method were established. Enhanced singlet correlation between two holes was observed. The preliminary results justify the need for an in-depth study.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Newtonian and elastic liquid jet interaction with a moving surface</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Keshavarz, Bavand</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the railroad industry a friction modifying agent may be applied to the rail or to the wheel in the form of a liquid jet. In this mode of application the interaction between the high speed liquid jet and a fast moving surface is important. Seven different Newtonian liquids with widely varying shear viscosities along with twelve different solutions of polyethylenoxide (PEO) and water with varying relaxation times were tested to isolate the effect of viscosity and elasticity from other fluid properties. Tests for the Newtonian liquids were done with five surfaces having different roughness heights to investigate the effects of surface roughness. High speed video imaging was employed to scrutinize the interaction between the impacting jet and the moving surface. For both Newtonian and Elastic liquids and all surfaces, decreasing the Reynolds number reduced the incidence of splash and consequently enhanced the transfer efficiency. At the elevated Weber numbers of the testing, the Weber number had a much smaller impact on splash than did the Reynolds number. The ratio of the surface velocity to the jet velocity has only a small effect on the splash, whereas increasing the roughness-height-to-jet-diameter ratio substantially decreased the splash threshold. Moreover, the Deborah number was also salient to the splash of elastic liquids.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Mathematical modeling of interaction of wet particles and application to fluidized beds</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Darabi, Pirooz</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In many industrial operations, such as fluidized bed granulators, coaters, and fluid cokers, a binding or reacting liquid is introduced into the system. Due to the effects of liquid, the multi-phase transport phenomena of these systems are more complicated compared to conventional gas-solid fluidization systems. In this thesis, mathematical modeling is used to study the interaction of wet particles. First, a coalescence model is developed to describe the binary collision of wet particles. The model is in the form of a wet coefficient of restitution and is used to determine the critical velocity—the boundary between coalescence or rebound outcomes—for a range of capillary numbers. Model predictions are compared with the available experimental data and good agreement is found. The model accounts for both liquid viscosity and surface tension effects and is used to investigate the boundary between collisions with dominant capillary and respective viscous effects. Then, by incorporating time- and temperature-dependant variations of the viscosity and thickness of the liquid coating, the model is used to determine the agglomeration tendency of bitumen-coated coke particles in fluid cokers. A simplified mathematical model and numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations are used to study the rupture of stretching liquid bridges between two solid spherical particles. The simplified model considers the geometry of the problem in which the gas-liquid interface is represented with a parabola. The numerical simulations of the Navier Stokes equations are performed with FLUENT and are used to investigate the viscous, surface tension, inertial, gravitational, and contact angle effects on the rupture distance and liquid distribution. Finally, the interaction of multiple wet particles is addressed by implementing the wet coefficient of restitution proposed in this thesis, using MFIX, an open-source Discrete Element Method (DEM) tool. DEM simulations of a fluidized bed consisting of mono-sized solid spherical particles pre-coated with identical liquid coatings are performed, and the effect of coating viscosity and thickness on the fluidization behaviour is investigated. Snapshots of the instantaneous particle positions are presented, and time-averaged values of the bed centroid in the y-direction, wet coefficient of restitution, and relative normal collision velocity are analyzed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Topological currents in dense matter</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Charbonneau, Arthur James</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis introduces the idea of a topological current that flows in regions with large magnetic fields, dense matter, and parity violation. We propose that such a current exists in the cores of neutron stars and may be responsible for the large proper motion (kicks) observed in some pulsars. This current is similar to the charge separation effect and chiral magnetic effect that may be responsible for parity (℘) and charge conjugation-parity (C℘) violation observed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). We start by deriving the topological current two ways. The first is a macroscopic derivation where we appeal to an anomaly induced by the presence of a fictitious axial field. The second method is microscopic, in which we consider how the modes of the Dirac equation in a magnetic field and chemical potential contribute to the current. We then discuss in great detail the elements necessary for a topological current to exist in a dense star. Our concern then rests with calculating the magnitude of topological currents in the many phases of matter thought to exist in dense stars. We choose four representative processes to investigate: nuclear matter, hyperons, kaon condensates, and strange quark matter. We then suppose that this current may somehow transfer its momentum out of the star, either by being physically ejected or by emitting radiation, causing a kick. We also discuss how the current may induce magnetic helicity and a toroidal magnetic field in the core of the star. We end by discussing the topological current in terms of the AdS/CFT correspondence, a powerful tool that allows one to obtain results from strongly coupled field theories by transferring the problem to the language of a weakly coupled gravitational theory. We introduce a toy model to how one might introduce topological currents into the AdS/CFT framework.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fractionation of particle suspensions in a viscoplastic fluid : towards a novel process</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Madani, Ario</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The focus of this thesis is the separation or sorting of particle suspensions in a yield stress or viscoplastic fluid. Although the process is applicable to most industrial suspensions, the motivation of the work stems from pulp and paper industry,i.e. papermaking and microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) suspensions. The work is presented in four different yet complementary studies. In the first study, the concept of particle fractionation in a viscoplastic fluid is introduced. Here this novel principle is demonstrated, batch wise, by measuring the difference in centrifugal force required to initiate motion of an initially stable particle suspension in a gel. The criteria for motion is delineated as the ratio of the centrifugal force to yield stress as a function of particle size and orientation. Demonstration experiments are given to illustrate that the separation process is very efficient. In the second and third studies we demonstrate the principle on two industrial suspensions, i.e. a SBK (semi-bleached kraft) papermaking fibre and MFC. With papermaking fibres, it is shown that efficient separation, based upon cell wall thickness can be achieved. With MFC, it is shown that the process is more efficient than traditional separation techniques, i.e hydrocyclone and pressure screen. In the final study, we speculate regarding the conditions required to make a continuous process based upon the batch testings. Here, it is identified that a spiral Poiseuille flow would be sufficient to achieve separation. The questions addressed in this study are what is the size of the unyielded region for this flow field and what is the bound for transition to turbulent flow. It was found that the magnitude of the swirling flow does not affect the size of the plug and the axial velocity is decoupled from the rotational rate. In addition, the yielded region is always formed in the middle of the annular gap. To address the flow state, a linear stability analysis was performed using the method of normal modes. The flow was found to be linearly stable for all conditions tested.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Multi-layer flows with yield stress fluids</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hormozi, Sarah</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Interfacial instabilities of multi-layer shear flows may be eliminated by astute positioning of yield stress fluid layers that remain unyielded at the interface(s). The contribution of this thesis comes in three parts. Firstly, we have performed a computational study of these flows in the setting of a Newtonian core fluid surrounded by a Bingham lubricating fluid, within pipe and channel configurations. The simulations include an inlet geometry in the computational model and study the multi-layer flows, both as the fluids are initially injected (start up) and later the established steady flows (development lengths). Nonlinear perturbations are also studied, showing in particular that during energy decay of stable perturbations the initial rapid decay of the perturbation kinetic energy relates to reforming/breaking of the unyielded plug and is followed by slower viscous decay. For axisymmetric perturbations these flows can be stable to order unity initial perturbation amplitudes and for Re[sign omitted]10². The channel geometry allows for symmetry breaking and appears to be less stable. A number of interesting effects are explored using the channel geometry. Secondly, we focus on demonstrating whether the stable core annular flow can be achieved when lubricating a visco-elastic core fluid with a yield stress fluid. We have performed over 100 experiments using Carbopol solutions as the lubricating yield stress fluid and Polyethylene Oxide solutions as the visco-elastic fluid. Thirdly, we have applied the energy stability method to study nonlinear stability of a core-annular flow of an Oldroyd-B fluid surrounded by a Bingham fluid. Together with the experimental study, this shows that visco-elasticity is not a barrier to use of this methodology.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical analysis of the ultrarelativistic and magnetized Bondi--Hoyle problem</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Penner, Andrew Jason</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, we present numerical studies of models for the accretion of fluids and magnetofluids onto rotating black holes. Specifically, we study three main scenarios, two of which treat accretion of an unmagnetized perfect fluid characterized by an internal energy sufficiently large that the rest-mass energy of the fluid can be ignored. We call this the ultrarelativistic limit, and use it to investigate accretion flows which are either axisymmetric or restricted to a thin disk. For the third scenario, we adopt the equations of ideal magnetohydrodyamics and consider axisymmetric solutions. In all cases, the black hole is assumed to be moving with fixed velocity through a fluid which has constant pressure and density at large distances. Because all of the simulated flows are highly nonlinear and supersonic, we use modern computational techniques capable of accurately dealing with extreme solution features such as shocks. In the axisymmetric ultrarelativistic case, we show that the accretion is described by steady-state solutions characterized by well-defined accretion rates which we compute, and are in reasonable agreement with previously reported results by Font and collaborators [1,2,3]. However, in contrast to this earlier work with moderate energy densities, where the computed solutions always had tail shocks, we find parameter settings for which the time-independent solutions contain bow shocks. For the ultrarelativistic thin-disk models, we find steady-state configurations with specific accretion rates and observe that the flows simultaneously develop both a tail shock and a bow shock. For the case of axisymmetric accretion using a magnetohydrodynamic perfect fluid, we align the magnetic field with the axis of symmetry. Preliminary results suggest that the resulting flows remain time-dependent at late times, although we cannot conclusively rule out the existence of steady-state solutions. Moreover, the flow morphology is different in the magnetic case: additional features are apparent that include an evacuated region near the symmetry axis and close to the black hole.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Thermo-viscous fingering in porous media and in-situ soil remediation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Moyles, Iain</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The removal of artificially and naturally placed oils found in the ground is of paramount concern for environmental reasons and for the extraction of crude oil for energy. While many companies are involved in this soil remediation process, the physics of the underlying problem are not very well understood. We present a mathematical model and analysis of oil extraction in a porous soil based around the injection of water. We first consider a saturation analysis based on conservation of mass between oil and water in a one-dimensional setting and we find that based on certain parameter values, the water-oil interface goes unstable producing viscous finger patterns. We then include the effects of surface tension between oil and water to determine how this affects the growth of such fingers. We conclude that in the limit of small surface tension effects, the results generalize to the original problem, but more importantly, we deduce that there is a scaling which places the formulation into a setting that is invariant with respect to the magnitude of surface tension effects. With this scaling, we notice that the effect of surface tension is to limit the growth of fingers to a maximal wave number and to prevent their formation entirely beyond a certain critical wave number. Finally with the inclusion of temperature, via heated water injection, we see the formation of a dual fingering pattern: one associated with the mass conservation analysis of the oil-water interface and one associated with the conservation of energy across an interface where thermal gradients occur. We see that the thermal gradients across the interface where temperature drops induce unstable viscous patterns with a higher wave number than would occur for an equivalent isothermal interface where there was solely a change in viscosity. The thermal gradients also promote fingering development downstream across the classical viscosity differential driven interface but at the expense of lowering the interfacial velocity. It is interesting to note that the change in saturation that occurs across the energy interface is a result of a pseudo-free boundary created by the thermal problem.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>In-plane stress analysis using tensor field photoelasticity</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gao, Sui</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Few experimental methods exist for evaluating all in-plane stress components in solid materials; because of the tensor nature of these quantities. Full field measurement of all three stress components is desirable, since plastic deformation or failure can result from any combination of the three. A new photoelastic stress measurement method is presented for evaluating all three in-plane stress components within a two-dimensional photoelastic material. The measurement method is based on the observation that the complex transmission factors that describe the optical phase changes due to stress-induced birefringence have a second order tensor character, similar to that of other tensor quantities such as stress and strain. The same transformation equations and Mohr’s circle construction can be applied to the rotation of optical axis. A Michelson type interferometer and phase shifting are used to quantify the phases of the complex transmission factors. Mohr’s circle calculation is applied to obtain the principal transmission factors and principal axis orientation. The principal stresses are then obtained from the principal transmission factors through the stresss optical relationship. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated by comparing the experimental and analytical results for a hollow circular ring under diametric compression.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Computational plenoptic image acquisition and display</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wetzstein, Gordon</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Recent advances in camera technology, computing hardware, and optical fabrication have led to the emergence of computational photography, a field exploring the joint design of optical light modulation and computational processing. While conventional cameras record two-dimensional images, the "ultimate" computational camera would capture all visual information with a single shot. The amount of control over such high-dimensional data is unprecedented: dynamic range, depth of field, focus, colour gamut, and time scale of a photograph can be interactively controlled in post-processing. Required visual properties include the colour spectrum as well as spatial, temporal, and directional light variation - the plenoptic function. Unfortunately, digital sensors optically integrate over the plenoptic dimensions; most of the desired information is irreversibly lost in the process. We explore the multiplexed acquisition of the plenoptic function in this thesis. For this purpose, we introduce a mathematical framework that models plenoptic light modulation and corresponding computational processing. This framework not only allows us to evaluate and optimize the optical components of computational cameras, but also subsequent reconstructions. The combined design of optical modulation and computational processing is not only useful for photography, displays benefit from similar ideas. Within this scope, we propose multi-layer architectures and corresponding optimization schemes for glasses-free 3D display. Compared to conventional automultiscopic displays, our devices optimize brightness, resolution, and depth of field while preserving thin form factors. In a different application, adaptive coded apertures are introduced to projection displays as next-generation auto-iris systems. Combined with computational processing that exploits limitations of human perception, these systems increase the depth of field and temporal contrast of conventional projectors. With computational optics, integrated into sunglasses or car windshields, the capabilities of the human visual system can be extended. By optically modulating perceived intensities and colours, we demonstrate applications to contrast manipulation, preattentive object detection, and visual aids for the colour blind. Finally, we introduce computational probes as high-dimensional displays designed for computer vision applications, rather than for direct view. These probes optically encode refraction caused by transparent phenomena into observable changes in colour and intensity. Novel coding schemes enable single-shot reconstructions of transparent, refractive objects.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Polaron physics beyond the Holstein model</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Marchand, Dominic</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Many condensed matter problems involve a particle coupled to its environment. The polaron, originally introduced to describe electrons in a polarizable medium, describes a particle coupled to a bosonic field. The Holstein polaron model, although simple, including only optical Einstein phonons and an interaction that couples them to the electron density, captures almost all of the standard polaronic properties. We herein investigate polarons that differ significantly from this behaviour. We study a model with phonon-modulated hopping, and find a radically different behaviour at strong couplings. We report a sharp transition, not a crossover, with a diverging effective mass at the critical coupling. We also look at a model with acoustic phonons, away from the perturbative limit, and again discover unusual polaron properties. Our work relies on the Bold Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (BDMC) method, which samples Feynman diagrammatic expansions efficiently, even those with weak sign problems. Proposed by Prokof'ev and Svistunov, it is extended to lattice polarons for the first time here. We also use the Momentum Average (MA) approximation, an analytical method proposed by Berciu, and find an excellent agreement with the BDMC results. A novel MA approximation able to treat dispersive phonons is also presented, along with a new exact solution for finite systems, inspired by the same formalism.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Spin effects in quantum point contacts</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ren, Yuan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Quantum point contacts (QPCs) are narrow constrictions between large reservoirs of two-dimensional electron gas, with conductance quantized in units of G=2e²/h at zero magnetic field. Despite decades of investigation, some conductance features of QPCs remain mysterious, such as an extra conductance plateau at 0.7(2e²/h) (0.7 structure) and a zero-bias peak (ZBP) in nonlinear conductance. In this thesis, we present experimental studies of transport anomalies in QPCs, aiming at shedding more light on these features. Conductance measurements are performed for ZBPs in a much wider range than in most previous work, focused especially on the low- and high-conductance regimes. The Kondo model and a model of subband motion are compared with experimental results, but both of them fall short of explaining the data. The subband-motion model is not spin-dependent, so it conflicts with the spin-related nature of ZBPs as confirmed by measurements of nuclear spin polarization in QPCs in an in-plane magnetic field. However, the motion of subbands and the spin dependence of these motions are clearly shown by thermopower spectroscopy. These results may help understand the origin of ZBPs and 0.7 structure.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>PIV measurements of flow through forming fabrics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Peng, Haiya</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Three-dimensional velocity fields in the single phase approach flow to a multiple layer woven forming fabric were measured using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The measurements were conducted on a scale model of a forming fabric in a water/glycerin flow loop. Each strand on the paper side of the model forming fabric had a filament diameter around 15.4mm, and the loop test section was 310mm squared, permitting the measurement of detailed velocity distributions over multiple strands of the fabric. The flow speed in the loop test section were varied to achieve screen Reynolds numbers (Res), calculated based on paper side filament diameter (d), between 15 and 65. PIV measurements showed that the normalized ZD velocity deviation decreases from 19.7% at a plane 0.25d upstream from the forming fabric to 4.2% at a plane 1.5d upstream. The normalized CMD velocity deviation decreases from 15.3% at a plane 0.25d upstream from the forming fabric to 1.9% at a plane 1.5d upstream. The normalized MD velocity deviation decreases from 14.5% at a plane 0.25d upstream from the forming fabric to 2.3% at a plane 1.5d upstream. The highest ZD velocity is about 3.3 times higher than the lowest ZD velocity at a plane 0.25d above the fabric. This ratio decreases to 1.2 at a plane 1.5d above the fabric. These findings show that the flow non-uniformity caused by the fabric weave is restrained to a short distance above the fabric. However, even this non-uniformity is not particularly felt by fibers, whose length scale results in an averaging of the local velocity field. CFD simulations of the same flow were consistent with the PIV measurements.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Silicon ring resonator add-drop multiplexers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Boeck, Robert</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides have become an attractive area of research to decrease the footprint of optical interconnects as well as to ensure high speed data transmission. Specifically, research into using SOI ring resonator add-drop filters for WDM applications have been increasingly pursued. A ring resonator coupled on both sides by straight waveguides enables one to add (multiplex) or drop (demultiplex) wavelengths. Using series-coupled ring resonators, with each resonator having a different length, enables better spectral performance than single ring resonators. In this thesis, we have analyzed the properties of SOI strip waveguides and directional couplers. We have compared different spectral properties of single and series-coupled ring resonators and showed the advantages of using series-coupled ring resonators. SOI strip waveguide series-coupled racetrack resonators exhibiting the Vernier effect were designed by us and fabricated at a leading edge foundry. The free spectral range was 36 nm, which is comparable to the span of the optical C-band. The drop port response showed interstitial peak suppression between 9 dB and 17 dB and minimal resonance splitting.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Monolithic integration of AlGaAs distributed Bragg reflectors on virtual Ge substrates via aspect ratio trapping</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lin, Yiheng</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Over the past two decades, researchers have devoted great efforts on Si photonics to overcome the communication bottleneck of integrated circuits. In order to realize short-reach optical interconnects, excellent performance has been achieved so far on waveguides, modulators and detectors, which use Si compatible materials (e.g. SiO₂, Si₃N₄ and SiGe) and processes. However, lasers on Si have been much more difficult to implement. Monolithically integrated vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) on Si platforms are a suitable choice as output devices on Si, and is the long-term goal of this project. The research for this thesis work chose Ge/Si ART (aspect ratio trapping) substrates as the Si platform to overcome the material mismatch between AlGaAs/GaAs system and Si, and investigated the first and crucial step of successful VCSEL integration on Si platforms, which is the VCSEL distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) growth and characterization on Ge/Si ART substrates. Three types of samples were grown and characterized to reveal the quality of DBRs and ART substrates. The results show good quality and potential for high performance VCSEL. The ART-based DBRs have reflectance spectra comparable to those grown on conventional bulk GaAs substrates and have smooth morphology. High-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) rocking curves show that the residual stress and crystal quality of the Ge films depend on oxide trench patterns. Though GaAs-DBRs have sharper satellite peaks, ART-DBRs also show good structural quality, considering the effect of more complex substrate structure with SiO₂, Ge and strained-Ge. The main peaks’ full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of ART-DBR are about twice as GaAs-DBR’s. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal very good periodicity and uniformity that are unaffected by threading dislocations or residual strain. These results are very encouraging for the successful full VCSEL growth on these substrates and also confirm that virtual Ge substrates via the ART technique are effective Si platforms for optoelectronic integrated circuits.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in sheared density stratified flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rahmani, Mona</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are the most commonly studied type of instability in sheared density stratified flows. Turbulence caused by these instabilities is an important mechanism for mixing in geophysical flows. The primary objectives of this study are the evolution of these instabilities and quantifying the mixing they generate using direct numerical simulations. The results are presented in three chapters. First, the evolution of primary Kelvin-Helmhlotz instabilities in two dimensions is studied for a wide range of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, representing real oceanic and atmospheric flows. The results suggest that some properties of KH billows are predictable by a semi-analytical model. It is shown that a new Corcos-Sherman scale is a useful guide when simulating turbulent KH flow fields. The details of the mixing process generated by the evolution of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities as it goes through different stages, is analyzed. As the Reynolds number increases a transition in the overall amount of mixing is found, which is in agreement with previous experimental studies. This transition is explained quantitatively by the entrainment and mixing caused by three-dimensional motions, in addition to those resulted from the two-dimensional growth of the instability. The effect of Prandtl number on mixing is studied to understand the characteristics of high Prandtl number mixing events in the ocean; these cases have usually been approximated by low Prandtl number simulations. The increase in the Pradtl number has some significant implications for the evolution of the billow, the time variation of mixing properties, and the overall mixing.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Characterization of photonic crystal silicon-on-insulator optical circuits fabricated by a CMOS foundry</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Schelew, Ellen N.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Prototype silicon photonic circuits in a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer fabricated using a CMOS-based single layer process, are thoroughly characterized. Thousands of devices were fabricated on a single 200 mm diameter wafer using deep UV lithography at the IMEC silicon photonics foundry. The devices studied integrate three key elements: i) input/output grating couplers, ii) waveguides, and iii) microcavities. The photonic crystal cavities are symmetrically coupled to input and output single mode channel waveguides, which couple light into tapered waveguides that are terminated by two-dimensional photonic crystal gratings couplers. The grating coupler efficiencies and bandwidths are studied independently from the other device components, both experimentally and by simulations, using free-space optics. At a fixed angle of incidence, light over a bandwidth of approximately 14 nm (TE) and 30 nm (TM) is coupled from grating to grating, in both experiments and simulations. The centre frequency of this coupling spectrum is tuned by varying the angle of incidence on the grating, by coating the grating with photoresist, and by varying the size of the holes that form the grating. The maximum net single-grating coupling efficiencies are measured to be 15% (26%) for TE (TM) coupling. Taking into account the limited aperture of the collection optics, and aberrations of the input coupling lenses, these measured net efficiencies are reasonably consistent with simulated true efficiencies of 21%(49%) found using Lumerical FDTD Solutions and MODE Solutions commercial software. Resonant transmission measurements from free space, via an input grating, through the complete integrated photonic circuit, including the photonic crystal microcavity, and off-chip via an output grating are measured for a number of different cavities. The transmission of light from the end of one tapered waveguide, through the cavity, to the end of the other tapered waveguide is found to be ~10%. The maximum microcavity quality factor measured is ~ 5000. This work demonstrates that fully integrated photonic circuits can be successfully fabricated using IMEC's CMOS foundry service. It further shows that useful overall coupling efficiencies can be realized using free space optics, which will be useful for probing such circuits when they are placed inside optical cryostats.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Bench-scale two-dimensional fluidized bed hydrodynamics and struvite growth studies</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Qu, Xiaocao</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A bench-scale, two-dimensional multi-compartmentalized fluidized reactor was designed and studies of hydrodynamic behavior of fluidization of struvite pellets were performed. Also size growth distribution tests were analyzed qualitatively. The study validated a previously-proposed theory, concerning the relationship between dynamic pressure drop and upflow velocity as well the experimental protocol to determine the minimum fluidization velocity. Findings indicated that the mixture of two-sized particles would behave rather independently of each other, before the bed expansion. It was suggested that bed height measurement could be another promising method to pinpoint minimum fluidization velocity as there is a sharp bed surface "waking episode" during the process of a packed bed being gradually fluidized. Bed expansion equations for the prediction of void fraction as a function of superficial upflow velocity or vice versa, have been established for 4 groups of monosize particles, as well as two mixtures of two-sized particles. The equation constants did not agree well with previously established ones. The two layers of segregated mixture bed had congruent linear relationships between the logarithmic void fraction and logarithmic upflow velocity. It was found that a mixture does not always go through segregation, but only when the size difference is large enough. Size growth distribution tests were performed under different hydrodynamic configurations as well as seeding conditions. Conclusions can be made that a bed with uniformly- distributed particle void fractions and higher mixing energy input (upflow velocity), normally has better performance of struvite growth in size.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>From displacement to mixing in a slightly inclined duct</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Taghavi, Seyed Mohammad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis studies buoyant displacement flows with two miscible fluids in pipes and 2D channels that are inclined at angles (β) close to horizontal. Detailed experimental, analytical and computational approaches are employed in an integrated fashion. The displacements are at low Atwood numbers and high Péclet numbers, so that miscibility effects are mostly observable after instability and via dispersive mixing. For iso-viscous Newtonian displacements, studying the front velocity variation as a function of the imposed flow velocity allows us to identify 3 distinct flow regimes: an exchange flow dominated regime characterized by Kelvin-Helmholtz-like instabilities, a laminarised viscous displacement regime with the front velocity linearly increasing with the mean imposed flow rate, and a fully mixed displacement regime. The transition between the first and the second regimes is found to be marked by a stationary layer of displaced fluid. In the stationary layer the displaced fluid moves in counter-current motion with zero net volumetric flux. Different lubrication/thin-film models have been used to predict the flow behaviour. We also succeed in characterising displacements as viscous or inertial, according to the absence/presence of interfacial instability and mixing. This dual characterisation allows us to define 5-6 distinct flow regimes, which we show collapse onto regions in the two-dimensional (Fr, Re cosβ/Fr)-plane. Here Fr is the densimetric Froude number and Re the Reynolds number. In each regime we have been able to offer a leading order approximation to the leading front velocity. A weighted residual method has also been used to include the effect of inertia within the lubrication modelling approach, which allows us to predict long-wave instabilities. We have extended the study to include the effects of moderate viscosity ratio and shear-thinning fluids. We see many qualitative similarities with the iso-viscous studies. Predictive models are proposed (and compared with experiments and simulations) for the viscous and inertial regimes. Having a significant yield stress in the displaced fluid leads to completely new phenomena. We identify two distinct flow regimes: a central-type displacement regime and a slump-type regime for higher density differences. In both regimes, the displaced fluid can remain completely static in residual wall layers.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Michel electrons analysis in the fine-grained detectors for T2K</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kim, Jiae</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Over the decades, neutrino physics has advanced remarkably. Confirmation of neutrino oscillation is one of the important results. It indicates that neutrinos have non-zero mass and flavor mixing. T2K is an experiment designed to observe neutrino oscillations. It is an accelerator-based experiment with a baseline of 295 km across Japan from Tokai to Kamioka. The accelerator and the near detector are at Tokai and the far detector is at Kamioka. The near detector characterizes neutrino interactions in the absence of oscillation effects. Fine-Grained Detectors (FGDs) are a part of the near detector, which provide target mass and track particles emerging from neutrino interactions occurring in the detector. The primary neutrino interaction channel mode of interest is the charged-current quasi-elastic (CCQE) interaction. In CCQE interactions, a charged-lepton and a proton are in the final state. The neutrino energy is reconstructed and its flavor is identified by the charged lepton. Other, non-CCQE neutrino interactions have another particles in the final state such as pions. The pions may stop in an FGD and decay to produce muons, which in turn stop and decay to produce electrons. The electrons from muon decay at rest are called Michel electrons. Michel electrons are a powerful tool to distinguish CCQE and non-CCQE interactions. This thesis describes the studies of Michel electron activity in the near detector using cosmic rays.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Intracavity generation of high order harmonics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hammond, Thomas John</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The goal of this work is the generation of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from a laser based source. To this end, we use high harmonic generation (HHG) to convert the near infrared output of a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser oscillator to the EUV. The requirement for HHG is a high peak intensity (&gt;10¹³ W/cm²), which can be met by external amplification of the laser output. The method of amplification chosen for this work is a femtosecond enhancement cavity (fsEC), which stores and amplifies the output of a femtosecond mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser by greater than a factor of 900 while maintaining the original repetition rate of 66 MHz. The design, benefits, and limitations of using a fsEC are discussed. The EUV light is created by the interaction of the amplified light with xenon gas delivered to the fsEC focus. The strong intracavity field leads to xenon plasma generation with detrimental effects on the HHG process, where it is shown that HHG is sensitive to the xenon gas and plasma dynamics. Methods of minimizing the plasma density and maximizing the EUV amplitude are discussed. The EUV is coupled out of the cavity, and up to the thirteenth harmonic (61 nm) of the laser is observed. The relative amplitudes of the different quantum trajectories generating the harmonics are calculated theoretically, and compared to experiment. The generated power of the eleventh harmonic (72 nm) is estimated to be 30μW, with a measured outcoupled power of 1.1μW. The relative intensity noise is also measured, with a cumulative root-mean-square (RMS) noise of &lt;1.2% over 100 Hz - 100 kHz bandwidth. In comparison to other laser based HHG systems, while the EUV flux is similar, the cumulative RMS noise is an order of magnitude lower.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Using low-energy ⁸Li beta-detected NMR to probe the magnetism of transition metals</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Parolin, Terry J.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Low-energy, beta-radiation-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) is applied to probe the magnetism of Au and Pd. The measurements were carried out at the TRIUMF β-NMR facility using optically spin-polarized ⁸Li⁺ as the probe. The behaviour of ⁸Li⁺+ in Au was investigated using samples in the form of a foil and a 100 nm film evaporated onto a MgO (100) substrate. The results are in overall agreement with those obtained previously in Ag, Cu, and Al. Narrow, temperature-independent resonances are observed and assigned to ions stopping in the octahedral interstitial and substitutional lattice sites; the latter appearing only for temperatures above 150 K which is attributed to a thermally-activated site change. The spin-lattice relaxation rate of substitutional site ions is less than half as fast at ambient temperature as that in the other simple metals. The rate is independent of external field for fields greater than 15 mT. A Korringa analysis for the substitutional ions indicates no significant electron enhancement over that of a free electron gas. For all four metals, the enhancements obtained are smaller than those for the host nuclei. No depth dependence was found for the resonances in Au. The highly exchange-enhanced metal Pd was studied using samples in the form of a foil and a 100 nm film evaporated onto a SrTiO₃ (100) substrate. Strongly temperature-dependent, negative shifts are observed that scale with the temperature dependence of the host susceptibility between room temperature and 110 K. The resonances appear as two partially resolved lines that exhibit similar behaviour with temperature. The linewidths are broad and double upon cooling. The data are indicative of ions stopping in a site of cubic symmetry. The spin-lattice relaxation rate increases linearly with increasing temperature and eventually saturates at higher temperatures, consistent with the prediction from spin fluctuation theory. In contrast to the simple metals, large Korringa enhancements are obtained in this host. Ferromagnetic dynamical scaling is observed to hold above 110 K. Features below this temperature indicate that the Li ions locally induce a further enhancement of the static susceptibility. The temperature dependence of the modified susceptibility is in keeping with the prediction for a weak itinerant ferromagnet just above the Curie temperature; however, there is no evidence of static order.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies of Tl₂Ba₂CuO₆+δ and YBa₂Cu₃O₇-δ : analysis of recent results and the construction of a new system</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mottershead, Jeffrey Daniel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results, from experiments performed at the Swiss Light Source, Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, and Advanced Light Source synchrotrons, on the high-temperature superconductors Tl₂Ba₂CuO₆+δ (Tl2201) and YBa₂Cu₃O (YBCO₆.₅) are presented. An overdoped Tl2201 sample with a TC of 30K was found to have a Fermi surface, consisting of a large hole pocket centred at (Pi ,Pi ), which is approaching a topological transition. A superconducting gap consistent with a dχ₂−y₂ order parameter was detected. In contrast with the underdoped HTSCs, where the quasiparticle (QP) linewidth at the top of the band is maximal in the antinodal direction and minimal in the nodal direction, overdoped Tl2201 was revealed to have a reverse nodal-antinodal anisotropy, with sharp QP peaks in the antinodal region and broader peaks in the nodal region. The Tl2201 results establish Tl2201 as a valuable material for exploring the overdoped side of the phase diagram with ARPES. Synchrotron experiments also yielded the first successful ARPES results on underdoped YBa₂Cu₃O₇−δ (YBCO). Surface-sensitive techniques were previously unsuccessful in studying YBCO because its cleaved surfaces are polar, resulting in an overdoped surface regardless of the doping level of the bulk. By doping the cleaved surfaces with potassium, the surface was progressively hole underdoped from as-cleaved continuously to the doping of the bulk, and subsequent ARPES experiments performed revealed a transition from a holelike Fermi surface on the as-cleaved surface to disconnected Fermi arcs when the surface doping matched the bulk. In parallel with the synchrotron-based research, an in-house ARPES system was constructed at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Unlike conventional ARPES systems, the ARPES setup at UBC incorporates a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system, which allows novel materials to be grown, characterized, and transferred to the ARPES chamber in vacuo. Novel design techniques to improve the accuracy of ARPES measurements are presented. The in-house ARPES system also serves as a prototype for an ARPES–MBE endstation being constructed at the Canadian Light Source (CLS). Design studies of some potential improvements to the in-house system, to be implemented at the CLS, are also presented.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Metal waveguides for multi-axial light guiding at nanometer scales</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Maqsood, Muhammad Waqas</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A basic component of most optical systems is an optical waveguide. There has been an increased interest in nanofabricated optical waveguides that incorporate metal layers due to their fabrication compatibility with existing complimentary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes and, their ability to sustain sub-wavelength confined electromagnetic modes. In this work, we have developed analytical techniques for designing metal waveguides that achieve tailored optical functionalities. The developed techniques are applied in two design examples which address contemporary problems related to waveguiding at sub-wavelength and nanometer scales.In the first example, we apply our analytical technique to optimize a bi-axial waveguide that can bend light at 90 degree, constructed from two uni-axial metal waveguides. The optimization procedure consists of mapping out wavevector values of the electromagnetic modes sustained by the two waveguides over the operational frequency range. The constituent materials and geometry of the waveguides are selected such that each waveguide sustains only one low-loss mode. The geometry of each of the waveguides is tailored in a way that the in-plane wavevector components for both waveguide modes are matched. The wavevector matching results in efficient coupling between the two modes, yielding predicted bending efficiencies over 90%. In the second example, we apply our analytical technique to optimize a bi-axial waveguide structure for coupling free-space light into surface plasmon polaritons (SPP), electromagnetic excitations bounded to the surface of a metal. We study the simple geometry consisting of a slit in a metal film, filled and covered with a dielectric. We break the configuration down into two uni-axial waveguide components. Using our approach, we optimize the materials and geometry of the slit so that wavevector matching is achieved between the light emanating from the slit and the adjacent SPP modes, yielding coupling efficiency over 68%.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electron transport in wide energy gap semiconductors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cheekoori, Reddiprasad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The dependence of the low-field electron drift mobility on the crystal temperature is determined for a number of wide energy gap semiconductors of interest. The materials considered include gallium nitride, aluminium nitride, indium nitride, and zinc oxide; while indium nitride is not a wide energy gap semiconductor in of itself, alloys of indium nitride with gallium nitride are. For the bulk results, it is found that indium nitride exhibits the highest low-field electron drift mobility while aluminium nitride exhibits the lowest low-field electron drift mobility. This is related to the small effective mass of electrons in indium nitride and the large effective mass of electrons in aluminium nitride. For the case of electrons confined within a two-dimensional electron gas, it is found that the low-field electron drift mobility exceeds that corresponding to the bulk material. This is due to the enhanced screening that electron concentrations exceeding the bulk ionized impurity concentrations level offer, i.e., surplus electrons act to further screen the ionized impurities; in a two-dimensional electron gas, the electron concentrations may far exceed those found in a bulk material. Recommendations for further study are suggested.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Classical and quantum nonlinear optics in confined photonic structures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ghafari Banaee, Mohamadreza</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Nonlinear optical phenomena associated with high-order soliton breakup in photonic crystal fibres and squeezed state generation in three dimensional photonic crystal microcavities are investigated. In both cases, the properties of periodically patterned, high-index contrast dielectric structures are engineered to control the dispersion and local field enhancements of the electromagnetic field. Ultra-short pulse propagation in a polarization-maintaining microstructured fibre (with 1 um core diameter and 1.1 m length) is investigated experimentally and theoretically. For an 80 MHz train of 130 fs pulses with average propagating powers in the fibre up to 13.8 mW, the output spectra consist of multiple discrete solitons that shift continuously to lower energies as they propagate in the lowest transverse mode of the fibre. The number of solitons and the amount that they shift both increase with the launched power. All of the data is quantitatively consistent with solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, but only when the Raman nonlinearity is treated without approximation, and self-steepening is included. The feasibility of using a parametric down-conversion process to generate squeezed electromagnetic states in 3D photonic crystal microcavity structures is investigated for the first time. The spectrum of the squeezed light is theoretically calculated by using an open cavity quantum mechanical formalism. The cavity communicates with two main channels, which model vertical radiation losses and coupling into a single-mode waveguide respectively. The amount of squeezing is determined by the correlation functions relating the field quadratures of light coupled into the waveguide. All of the relevant model parameters are realistically estimated using 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Squeezing up to ~20% below the shot noise level is predicted for reasonable optical excitation levels. To preserve the squeezed nature of the light generated in the microcavity, a unidirectional coupling geometry from the microcavity to a ridge waveguide in a slab photonic crystal structure is studied. The structure was successfully fabricated in a silicon membrane, and experimental measurements of the efficiency for the signal coupled out of the structure are in good agreement with the result of FDTD simulations. The coupling efficiency of the cavity mode to the output channel is ~60%.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Optofluidics for microscopy and sensing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chowdhury, Mohammad Faqrul Alam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Optofluidics describes a relatively new area of research that aims to synergistically combine optics and fluidics technologies. In this work, we examine the application and integration of small fluid volumes into two types of optical devices, yielding improvements in either tunability, flexibility, or cost-effectiveness. First, we explore a simple methodology to dispense and shape water droplets for use as the magnifying element in a microscope operating under either reflection-mode or transmission-mode illumination. A water droplet is created at the end of a syringe and then coated with a thin layer of silicone oil to mitigate evaporation. By applying mechanical pressure to the water droplet using a metal tip, the shape of the droplet is tuned to yield focusing properties amenable for microscopy. Images captured using the microscope demonstrate micron-scale resolution, variable magnification, and imaging quality comparable to that obtained by a conventional, laboratory-grade microscope. Next, we develop a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor that exploits the index matching and coating capabilities of fluids. Conventional SPR sensor are implemented using an external light source, optical components to polarize incident light and guide light to and from a metal surface, a coupling device (such as a prism) to convert free-space light into surface plasmons on a metal surface and back into free-space light, and a light detector. Here, we develop a new SPR device architecture by combining several optical components via index matching fluid, which eliminates the need for a prism and integrates light delivery, light polarization control, surface plasmon coupling onto a thin, flexible substrate. We experimentally characterize the SPR device and find good agreement between experimental reflectivity measurements and a theoretical reflectivity model based on transfer-matrix formalism. By developing these new methods to integrate fluids for both microscopy and optical sensing applications, this work provides results that highlight both the promise and challenges of creating optical systems based on fluids.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Growth and structure of yttrium sesquioxide epitaxial films</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Webster, Scott Elliott</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The use of molecular beam epitaxy as a method for producing solid state host crystals for planar waveguide lasers has been investigated. Single crystal yttrium sesquioxide with a very high degree of structural order has been grown on R-plane sapphire substrates. The (01Ῑ2) Al₂O₃ substrates were annealed in air at 1150°C to generate atomically smooth surfaces with parallel atomic steps. This process was important for maximizing structural quality and minimizing surface roughness of the grown Y₂O₃ ﬁlm. A critical-thickness-like phenomenon was discovered, where the Y₂O₃ would grow in regions with near structural perfection at the beginning of growth. In thicker ﬁlms, the x-ray diffraction peaks became wider, indicating less crystalline uniformity. The maximum equivalent “critical thickness” achieved was 7 nm for a ﬁlm grown at 800°C with a growth rate of 20 nm/hr. The highly ordered material may be present in one uniform layer or distributed in smaller regions throughout the thin ﬁlm. Y₂O₃ ﬁlms on Al₂O₃ were annealed in air at temperatures up to 1400°C to study interdiffusion. By analyzing x-ray diffraction measurements, we found that Al migrated from the substrate into the Y₂O₃ ﬁlm with an approximate activation energy for bulk diffusion of 3.0 eV. Diffusion on the Y₂O₃ surface was estimated to have an activation energy of (0.5 ± 0.3) eV from atomic force microscopy images. After annealing, the presence of Y₄Al₂O₉, YAlO₃, and Y₃Al₅O₁₂ phases was conﬁrmed using x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence measurements. Attempts were made to use molecular hydrogen gas and gallium as surfactants during growth to improve ﬁlm properties. No conclusive beneﬁt was observed. Y₂O₃ ﬁlm surface roughness was observed to increase roughly proportionally to the square root of ﬁlm thickness. A 600 nm thick waveguide layer grown under optimal conditions had a root-mean-square roughness of 5.8 nm. This level of roughness could cause scattering loss at the waveguide core-cladding interface that is problematic for practical applications.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Giant magnetoresistance and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic hybrid nanostructures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rizal, Conrad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Significant advances in the growth, measurement, and characterization methods in the field of nanoengineering have made Co-based magnetic hybrid (ferromagnetic and non-magnetic) nanostructures increasingly important for the development of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensors and high magnetic-moment biocompatible nanoparticles for use in the future magnetic technology. This thesis presents the growth, measurement, and characterization of magnetic hybrid nanostructures (multilayers, alloys, and nanoparticles) that exhibit interesting magnetoresistance (MR) and magnetic properties, which are significant in the development of state-of-the-art magnetic technology for use in the electronics and biomedical sectors. Firstly, Co/Au multilayers have been grown on glass substrates using e-beam evaporation, and then Co/Ag and Co/Cu multilayers have been grown on polyimide substrates using pulsed-current deposition. All of these multilayers exhibited the GMR effect at room temperature. The maximum MR for Co/Au, Co/Ag, and Co/Cu multilayers was 2.1 %, 9.1 %, and 4.1 %, respectively. The e-beam evaporated multilayers exhibited strong magnetic anisotropy when the films were deposited at the angle of 45 degrees. The electrodeposited multilayers exhibited strong magnetic anisotropy when strain was introduced externally. In both the cases, the GMR is strongly influenced by the ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layer thicknesses and interfacial states between layers. Secondly, novel nanocomposites Co nanoparticles embedded in Au matrix have been developed using pulsed-current deposition on polyimide substrates. They exhibited interesting MR, grain size, and saturation magnetization characteristics. The maximum room temperature GMR found was 4.6 %. X-ray diffraction, magnetization, and low temperature measurements suggest that a smaller grain size formed during higher current density correlates with the larger MR values for these nanocomposites. Thirdly, high-magnetic-moment biocompatible FeCo nanostructures have been developed using pulsed-current deposition. The nanostructures exhibited saturation magnetization of up to 240 emu/g, which is much larger than the saturation magnetization of either Co or Fe. The less expensive and highly sensitive GMR sensors if coated with specific probes, and if the target biomolecules are labelled with high-moment biocompatible nanoparticles presented in this thesis, the GMR sensors have potential for use in improving the early detection and treatment of chronic diseases (e.g., prostate and lung cancer) using biomagnetic technology.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Laser-induced electron emission from arrays of carbon nanotubes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yaghoobi, Parham</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Recently there has been growing interest in the interaction of light and nanomaterials, especially carbon nanotubes. Although there exist a large number of studies on the physical and chemical properties of nanotubes with various spectroscopic techniques, only a limited number of works have looked at this interaction for electron source applications. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates light-induced electron emission from arrays of nanotubes with a broad range of wavelengths and light intensities. I demonstrate that arrays of nanotubes have a quantum efficiency of &gt; 10-⁵ in the photoelectric regime, which is comparable to that of metal photocathodes such as copper. Nanotubes are also expected to have better operational lifetime than metals because of their complete chemical structure. I also demonstrate that, based on an effect called "Heat Trap", a spot on the surface of a nanotube array can be heated to above 2,000 K using a low-power beam of light with a broad range of wavelengths from ultraviolet to infrared. Light-induced heating of a typical bulk conductor to electron emission temperatures requires high-power lasers. This is because of the efficient dissipation of heat generated at the illuminated spot to the surroundings, since electrical conductors are also typically excellent thermal conductors. I show that the situation can be drastically different in an array of nanotubes. This behaviour has far-reaching implications for electron sources. For example, the fabrication cost of light-induced electron sources can be signicantly reduced since the nanotube-based cathode can be heated to thermionic emission temperatures with inexpensive, low-power, battery-operated handheld lasers as apposed to high-power or pulsed laser sources, which are currently required for metal cathodes. Arrays of nanotubes can also be shape engineered because of their sparse nature. I have demonstrated that the emission current density can be increased by a factor of 4 by densifying the array with a liquid-induced shrinkage that works by pulling the nanotubes closer together. The Implications of the findings reported in this thesis go beyond conventional electronbeam technologies. For instance, they could lead to novel devices such as thermionic solar cells, solar displays and new types of optical modulators and thermoelectrics.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Simulation of hydrodynamics of the jet impingement using Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Maghzian, Hamid</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Controlled cooling is an important part of steel production industry that affects the properties of the outcome steel. Many of the researches done in controlled cooling are experimental. Due to progress in the numerical techniques and high cost of experimental works in this field the numerical work seems more feasible. Heat transfer analysis is the necessary element of successful controlled cooling and ultimately achievement of novel properties in steel. Heat transfer on the surface of the plate normally contains different regimes such as film boiling, nucleate boiling, transition boiling and radiation heat transfer. This makes the analysis more complicated. In order to perform the heat transfer analysis often empirical correlations are being used. In these correlations the velocity and pressure within the fluid domain is involved. Therefore in order to obtain a better understanding of heat transfer process, study of hydrodynamics of the fluid becomes necessary. Circular jet due to its high efficiency has been used vastly in the industry. Although some experimental studies of round jet arrays have been done, yet the characteristics of a single jet with industrial geometric and flow parameters on the surface of a flat plate is not fully understood. Study of hydrodynamics of the jet impingement is the first step to achieve better understanding of heat transfer process. Finite element method as a popular numerical method has been used vastly to simulate different domains. Traditional approaches of finite element method, Lagrangian and Eulerian, each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Lagrangian approach has been used widely in solid domains and Eulerian approach has been widely used in fluid fields. Jet impingement problem, due to its unknown free surface and the change in the boundary, falls in the category of special problems and none of the traditional approaches is suitable for this application. The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation has emerged as a technique that can alleviate many of the shortcomings of the traditional Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations in handling these types of problems. Using the ALE formulation the computational grid need not adhere to the material (Lagrangian) nor be fixed in space (Eulerian) but can be moved arbitrarily. Two distinct techniques are being used to implement the ALE formulation, namely the operator split approach and the fully coupled approach. This thesis presents a fully coupled ALE formulation for the simulation of flow field. ALE form of Navier-Stokes equations are derived from the basic principles of continuum mechanics and conservation laws in the fluid. These formulations are then converted in to ALE finite element equations for the fluid flow. The axi-symmetric form of these equations are then derived in order to be used for jet impingement application. In the ALE Formulation as the mesh or the computational grid can move independent of the material and space, an additional set of unknowns representing mesh movement appears in the equations. Prescribing a mesh motion scheme in order to define these unknowns is problem-dependent and has not been yet generalized for all applications. After investigating different methods, the Winslow method is chosen for jet impingement application. This method is based on adding a specific set of partial differential Equations(Laplace equations) to the existing equations in order to obtain enough equations for the unknowns. Then these set of PDEs are converted to finite element equations and derived in axi-symmetric form to be used in jet impingement application. These equations together with the field equations are then applied to jet impingement problem. Due to the number of equations and nonlinearity of the field equations the solution of the problem faces some challenges in terms of convergence characteristics and modeling strategies. Some suggestions are made to deal with these challenges and convergence problems. Finally the numerical treatment and results of analyzing hydrodynamics of the Jet Impingement is presented. The work in this thesis is confined to the numerical simulation of the jet impingement and the specifications of an industrial test setup only have been used in order to obtain the parameters of the numerical model.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental and computational study of mixing behavior in stirred tanks equipped with side entry impellers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sossa, Jaime Alberto</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The wide applicability of mechanically stirred tanks in industry demands a comprehensive understanding of the physical and chemical phenomena controlling the performance of these fundamental units. The rheological complexity of some industrial fluids can create unfavorable mixing environments like dead zones that limit the contact area among the components being mixed. Also, the complex three dimensional nature of the flow generated by the impellers makes difficult the prediction of the flow properties, especially when the fluid viscosity is a function of the shear rate. Some research groups have investigated mixing flow of these kinds of fluids in conventional stirred tanks with top-entry impellers. But, little has been done to characterize the flow behavior in tanks with side-entry impellers. In order to improve our understanding and provide insight into the flow mixing occurring in stirred tanks with side entry impellers, the flow field generated by different impellers in scale-down vessels filled with glycerine and carbopol solutions, was studied using the flow visualization technique, particle image velocimetry (PIV). Moreover, a computational model was built to predict flow variables and mixing characteristics unattainable with the experimental technique. The capabilities of the model were evaluated based on the velocity fields obtained experimentally. Good agreement was found between the predicted and measured macroscale flow structures and global mixing parameters. However, the models were unable to predict the symmetric flow observed during the experiments at high rotational speeds, likely due to the approach taken to simulate the flow, which provides a steady state velocity profile for one specific impeller location Overall the results showed the formation of dead zones and segregated regions when mixing the non-Newtonian solutions. The size of the dynamic regions and the average velocity near the impeller were improved by increasing the suction area. Likewise, large pitch ratios were found to enhance the active mixing zone and the axial discharge. While, radial discharge and a strong tangential flow arose when the viscous forces dominate the flow. In conclusion, the flow features were defined by the Reynolds number in the vicinity of the impeller and the restrictions imposed by the walls of the vessel.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A particle-based model for computing fluid flows and cell dynamics</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The connection between certain human diseases and changes in the mechanical properties of living cells is well established, e.g. in the cases of malaria and cancer. However, the mechanism for the mechanical modifications, which tend to facilitate the pathogenesis of such diseases, is not always clear. For instance, the overall loss of deformability of malaria-infected red blood cells (RBCs) corresponds to a 10-fold increase in the rigidity of the cell membrane. On the other hand, micropipette aspiration has only measured a 3-fold increase in the elastic modulus. In this thesis, a particle-based model is developed to explore the interplay between the underlying microstructures and the behavior of the cell as a whole. The research consists of three related projects. The first project deals with the long-standing problem of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method with open boundaries and solid walls. We propose a "rotational pressure-correction scheme" with a consistent pressure boundary condition that leads to a large improvement in accuracy of calculated pressure and the drag coefficient on solid obstacles. The second and third projects concern developing a 2D and then 3D particle-based model for RBCs to explore the parasite-driven changes in malaria-infected RBCs. In our models the cell membrane is replaced by a set of discrete particles connected by linear or nonlinear springs. In addition, a linear bending elasticity is implemented using the deviation of the local curvature from the innate curvature of the biconcave shape of a resting RBC. The cytoplasm and the external liquid are modelled as homogeneous Newtonian fluids, and discretized by particles as in standard SPH solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. The malaria parasite is modelled as an aggregate of particles constrained to rigid-body motion. We argue that the discrepancy in the estimated elastic modulus of the membrane is caused by the presence of the rigid parasite particles inside infected cells, and have carried out numerical simulations to demonstrate this mechanism. Our three-dimensional simulation of RBC stretching tests by optical tweezers accurately demonstrates the compensating effects between the existence of malaria parasites and the elevated stiffness of the membrane on the overall deformability of infected RBC.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The pion branching ratio (R^π = [formula omitted] ) is an auspicious observable for a test of the standard model of particle physics (SM). Rπ has been calculated within this framework with high precision because the strong interaction dynamics cancel out in the ratio and the structure dependence only appears through electroweak corrections. Since the discovery of the electronic pion decay in 1958, Rπ was measured with increasing precision and confirmed the SM value of RπSM = 1.2352(2) x 10⁻⁴. However, the current experimental precision is 20 times worse than the theoretical one leaving a large window for potential new physics at “high-mass" scales (up to ∽1000 TeV). The PIENU experiment aims at measuring Rπ with an improved precision by a factor larger than 5 over the previous experiment at TRIUMF (Rπexp = (1.2265 ± 0:0056) x 10⁻⁴) in order to confront the theoretical prediction at the 0.1% level. The result presented in this thesis focuses on a fraction of the data taken since the beginning of physics data taking in 2009. A blind analysis has been implemented in order to avoid a human bias. With this set of data, the procedure is established for the final analysis. An improvement by a factor 1.17, dominated by statistical uncertainty, has been reached in the branching ratio precision. If added to the current Particle Data Group value, the result of this analysis reduces the uncertainty on the branching ratio by ∽25%.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>First mass measurements of highly charged, short-lived nuclides in a Penning trap and the mass of Rb-74</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ettenauer, Stephan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>To date, Vud of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix is most precisely determined from superallowed 0⁺ → 0⁺ nuclear β-decays. In addition to half-life, Branching Ratio, and transition energy (called Q_EC-value) of a superallowed decay, theoretical corrections have to be considered to extract Vud. Among those, the isospin symmetry breaking corrections, δC , show discrepancies between different theoretical models, which are critical to be resolved. ⁷⁴Rb has the largest δC of all 13 superallowed β-emitters used to obtain Vud and would carry particular weight to discriminate between models were it not limited by the uncertainty in the Q_EC-value. However, ⁷⁴Rb’s half-life of 65 ms has previously posed a real challenge to the experimental precision in its Q_EC -value, which is best determined by direct mass measurements in Penning traps. In this work, Penning trap mass measurements of short-lived nuclides have been performed for the first time with highly-charged ions, using the TITAN facility. Compared to singly-charged ions, this provides an improvement in experimental precision that scales with the charge state q. Neutron-deficient Rb-isotopes have been prepared in an electron beam ion trap to q = 8 − 12+ prior to the mass measurements. In combination with a Ramsey scheme, this opens the door to unrivalled precision with gains of 1-2 orders of magnitude. The method is particularly suited for short-lived nuclides such as ⁷⁴Rb and its mass has been determined. In the realm of fundamental symmetries studied in low-energy nuclear systems such as in ⁷⁴Rb, the precision achieved by highly-charged ions is essential. For mass measurements motivated by nuclear structure or nuclear astrophysics, where the present experimental precision is already sufficient, this novel technique significantly reduces the measurement time and thus allows one to map the nuclear mass landscape more broadly. In the exploration towards the limits of nuclear existence where experimental efforts typically face shorter half-lives and lower production yields of radioisotopes, the same precision can be achieved by compensating for both challenges with the higher charge state. Finally, highly-charged ions provide opportunities for an unprecedented resolving power to identify low-lying nuclear isomers. This potential has firstly been demonstrated with ⁷⁸,⁷⁸mRbq⁼⁸⁺.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Emergence and stability of Majorana fermions in proximity-coupled topological insulator nanowires</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cook, Ashley M.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A finite-length topological insulator nanowire, proximity-coupled to an ordinary bulk s-wave superconductor and subject to a longitudinal applied magnetic field is shown to realize a one-dimensional topological superconductor with an unpaired Majorana fermion localized at each end of the nanowire. Here we also show that the unpaired Majorana fermions persist in this system for any value of the chemical potential inside the bulk band gap of order 300 meV in Bi₂Se₃ by computing the Majorana number. From this calculation, we also show that the unpaired Majorana fermions persist when the magnetic flux through the nanowire cross-section deviates significantly from half flux quantum. Lastly, we demonstrate that the unpaired Majorana fermions persist in strongly disordered wires with fluctuations in the on-site potential ranging in magnitude up to the size of the bulk band gap. These results suggest this solid-state system should exhibit unpaired Majorana fermions under accessible conditions likely important for experimental study or future applications.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Curve-counting invariants and crepant resolutions of Calabi-Yau threefolds</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Steinberg, David Christopher</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The Donaldson-Thomas (DT) theory of a Calabi-Yau threefold X gives rise to subtle deformation invariants. They are considered to be the mathematical counterparts of BPS state counts in topological string theory compactified on X. Principles of physics indicate that the string theory of a singular Calabi-Yau threefold and that of its crepant resolution ought to be equivalent, so one might expect that the DT theory of a singular Calabi-Yau threefold ought to be equivalent to that of its crepant resolution. There is some difficulty in defining DT when X is singular, but Bryan, Cadman, and Young have (in some generality) defined DT theory in the case where X is the coarse moduli space of an orbifold χ. The crepant resolution conjecture of Bryan-Cadman-Young gives a formula determining the DT invariants of the orbifold in terms of the DT invariants of the crepant resolution. In this dissertation, we begin a program to prove the crepant resolution conjecture using Hall algebra techniques inspired by those of Bridgeland.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical simulation of turbulent premixed flames with conditional source-term estimation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Salehi, Mohammad Mahdi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) is a closure model for turbulence-chemistry interactions. This model is based on the conditional moment closure hypothesis for the chemical reaction source terms. The conditional scalar field is estimated by solving an integral equation using inverse methods. CSE was originally developed for - and has been used extensively in - non-premixed combustion. This work is the first application of this combustion model to predictive simulations of turbulent premixed flames. The underlying inverse problem is diagnosed with rigorous mathematical tools. CSE is coupled with a Trajectory Generated Low-Dimensional Manifold (TGLDM) model for chemistry. The CSE-TGLDM combustion model is used with both Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence models to simulate two different turbulent premixed flames. Also in this work, the Presumed Conditional Moment (PCM) turbulent combustion model is employed. This is a simple flamelet model which is used with the Flame Prolongation of ILDM (FPI) chemistry reduction technique. The PCM-FPI approach requires a presumption for the shape of the probability density function of reaction progress variable. Two shapes have been examined: the widely used beta-function and the Modified Laminar Flamelet PDF (MLF-PDF). This model is used in both RANS and large-eddy simulation of a turbulent premixed Bunsen burner. Radial distributions of the calculated temperature field, axial velocity and chemical species mass fraction have been compared with experimental data. This comparison shows that using the MLF-PDF leads to predictions that are similar, and often superior to those obtained using the beta-PDF. Given that the new PDF is based on the actual chemistry - as opposed to the ad hoc nature of the beta-PDF - these results suggest that it is a better choice for the statistical description of the reaction progress variable.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Leveraging eigenvalue veering for improved sensing with microelectromechanical systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Reynen, Gregory Peter</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Energy localization in nearly periodic microsystems can be leveraged to create a new sensing paradigm that is orders of magnitude more sensitive than current resonant-frequency based systems. In this thesis, the theory which supports this claim is independently developed from a mathematical description of a two degree-of-freedom resonant system. A novel proof-of-concept microelectromechanical system (MEMS) was also designed and fabricated to support the theoretical claims. The system employed a unique resonator design with two different approaches to inducing asymmetry in the system which in turn leads to the localization of energy in one of the resonators. The system proved the resonant frequency dependence on disorder in the system and also showed that the eigenvector sensitivity to disorder was at least an order of magnitude greater than the frequency sensitivity. However, the eigenvector sensitivity could not be matched with theory. This was likely due to the time-varying nature of the coupling spring stiffness (up to a 300% change in magnitude). The coupling spring stiffness was time-varying due to the inverse cubic relationship to coupling gap distance. The gap distance changes with time since it is practically impossible to excite only the common mode, leading to a superposition with the anti-phase mode. This was partially due to the input signal displaying non harmonic tendencies. At the same time, energy localization in the system leads to different amplitudes of vibration for each resonator which will also lead to gap distance modulation. A three degree-of-freedom system was also examined theoretically with different approaches to stiffness perturbation and the resultant sensitivity expressions which can be leveraged for improved sensors were developed. The analysis shows that three degree-of-freedom systems can yield a 250% improvement over two degree-of-freedom systems which themselves are practically able to provide three to four order of magnitude improvements in sensitivity over resonant-frequency based sensors of the same size. The tools and insight needed to design for higher degree-of-freedom system are also provided in the form of the eigen-derivatives approach to calculating eigenvalue and eigenvector sensitivity to disorder in a symmetric system.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A study of topological insulators in two and three dimensions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Weeks, William Conan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this work we introduce a new model for a topological insulator in both two and three dimensions, and then discuss the possibility of creating a fractional topological insulator in the three dimensional version. We also explore the possibility of engineering a quantum spin Hall phase in Graphene through the application of heavy metal adatoms. We show that the two dimensional model on the Lieb lattice, and its three dimensional counterpart, the so called edge centered cubic or Perovskite lattice, possess non-trivial Z₂ invariants, and gapless edge modes, which are the signatures of the topological insulating state. Having established that these lattices can become topological insulators, we then tune several short range hoppings in the model and show that it is possible to flatten the lowest energy bands in each case. After flattening the bands we add in a Hubbard term and then use a mean field decoupling to show that there is a portion of phase space where the system remains non-magnetic, and then conjecture that the many body ground state in three dimensions could become a fractional topological insulator. For the model on graphene, we start by using density functional theory (DFT) to find a pair of suitable heavy elements that are non-magnetic, have a strong spin orbit coupling and prefer to sit at the center of the hexagonal lattice. We then establish that for adatoms distributed in a periodic configuration, again with DFT, that a gap will open at the Dirac point in the presence of spin orbit coupling. To prove the gap is topologically non-trivial, we show that it is possible to adiabatically connect this model to the original Kane-Mele model, a known topological insulator. Lastly, we show that for adatoms distributed randomly the effect survives.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Shubnikov-de Haas measurements and the spin magnetic moment of YBa₂Cu₃O₆.₅₉</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ramshaw, Brad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>High-temperature superconductivity (high-Tc) was discovered in 1986 in copper-oxide materials, and since that time the goal of understanding high-Tc has driven the advancement of theoretical and experimental condensed matter physics. Despite the concerted efforts of some of the brightest minds in physics over the past 26 years, there is still no microscopic understanding of these materials. One of the main problems is an uncertainty as to whether Fermi liquid theory, which has been the foundation of our understanding of conventional metals for over 50 years, can be used to describe the strange pseudo-metallic properties of the cuprates. This thesis studies the resistivity of the high-Tc superconductor YBa₂Cu₃O₆+x (YBCO) in magnetic fields up to 70 Tesla. These resistivity measurements show oscillatory behaviour as a function of magnetic field, which is a clear signature of a Fermi surface. The development of an advanced technique (based on a genetic algorithm) for analyzing the oscillatory resistance is presented, and the Fermi surface of YBa₂Cu₃O₆.₅₉ is determined with great precision by analyzing the field, angle, and temperature dependences of the oscillations. Analysis of the data shows that the electronic g factor, related to the strength of quasiparticle spin magnetic moment, does not experience strong renormalization in YBCO, in contrast with previous experimental studies. This lack of renormalization has important implications for theoretical descriptions of YBCO. A full description of the shape of the Fermi surface of YBCO is presented, and measurements of YBCO with different oxygen concentrations give the evolution of the Fermi surface with hole doping. A novel technique for fine-tuning the hole doping in YBCO is presented in the context of a Hall coefficient experiment. The result is a detailed doping dependence of the Hall coefficient, indicating that the Fermi surface seen in quantum oscillation experiments is influenced by some type of electronic order---such as charge and spin stripe order---competing with superconductivity near 1/8th hole doping. The behaviour of the superconducting vortex lattice in a magnetic field is analyzed as a function of temperature, and this behaviour also indicates that something is competing with superconductivity near 1/8th doping.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Control of atoms and molecules with shaped broadband pulses</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhdanovich, Sergey</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The main goal of this PhD work is an experimental study of coherent excitation of atomic and molecular wavepackets, i.e. superpositions of many quantum eigenstates, by shaped femtosecond pulses. Approaches allowing nearly complete population transfer between quantum eigenstates were well studied in the past within the two level approximation. In this work we focus on adiabatic and non-adiabatic methods of population transfer beyond the two-level approximation. Excitation of multi-level target states is possible due to broad spectrum of an ultrashort pulse which contains frequencies needed for multiple transitions to different states in the final superposition. At the same time, the spectrum of an ultrashort pulse can be modified, or ``shaped'', in order to affect the excitation process and control the amplitudes in the final superposition. Both non-adiabatic and quasi-adiabatic methods were first implemented and studied in electronic wavepackets in alkali atoms. The non-adiabatic approach revealed features linked to the strong-field perturbations of the energy level structure of the quantum system. An adiabatic method was implemented for the first time on a femtosecond time scale, and was thoroughly characterized. The control over complex amplitudes in the target superposition was demonstrated as well as completeness of the population transfer. In the second part of this work, we focused on coherent control of rotational wavepackets in diatomic molecules. Rotational excitation by a periodic train of femtosecond pulses was investigated in the context of ``delta-kicked'' rotor - a paradigm system for studying quantum chaos, and the effect of quantum resonance was demonstrated for the first time in a system of true quantum rotors. Control of uni-directional molecular rotation was proposed and demonstrated with a novel ``chiral pulse train'' - a sequence of femtosecond pulses with polarization rotating from pulse to pulse by a predefined angle. All the developed techniques offer new tools in coherent control of atomic and molecular wavepackets on an ultrashort time scale.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Silicon photonic filters for wavelength-division multiplexing and sensing applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wei, Shi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis is a theoretical and experimental study of novel silicon photonic filters, such as traveling-wave resonators (TWRs) and grating-assisted, contra-directional couplers (contra-DCs), for on-chip wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) systems and sensing applications. To measure optical losses of photonic components such as Y-branch splitters and waveguide crossings, we have developed a ring-resonator based technique which is accurate, simple, and space-efficient. A number of novel devices have been demonstrated using commercial CMOS-photonics fabrication foundries, with the aim of developing large-scale photonic integrated circuits using the standard process development tools. Two types of wavelength-selective, TWR-based reflective filters have been demonstrated for applications such as remote sensing and tunable lasers. Ultra-compact, high-Q microdisk resonators have been demonstrated, with radii of down to 1.5 µm, free spectral ranges (FSRs) of up to 71 nm, loaded Q's of up to 88,000, and unloaded Q's of over 100,000. Contra-DCs have been studied using coupled-mode theory. An add-drop filter designed using contra-DCs in slab-modulated rib waveguides has been proposed and demonstrated, which shows a flat-top response and a narrow bandwidth of 50--100 GHz, promising for dense-WDM applications. Also, we proposed an out-of-phase grating design to suppress the intra-waveguide reflection in contra-DCs. Using this novel anti-reflection (AR) design, we have demonstrated an add-drop filter with a single-band, flat-top response and a wide channel bandwidth of 6.5 nm, which enables athermal operation in a large temperature span of &gt; 70 K. This AR contra-DC can be used to build an on-chip coarse-WDM system for power-efficient, ultra-high-speed optical interconnects. Furthermore, we have proposed and demonstrated an electrically tunable phase-shifted contra-DC. In order to overcome the challenges facing microring resonators, such as limited FSRs and difficulty in controlling the bus-resonator coupling, we have proposed to integrate contra-DCs with microring resonators for selective bus-resonator coupling. Using this method, we have demonstrated a single dominant resonant mode in a microring resonator that originally has a small FSR of 1.3 nm. This grating-coupled microring resonator is promising for applications that need a huge free spectral range, such as cascaded resonator sensor arrays and ultra-high-bandwidth WDM systems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Design and application of combined multiphoton microscopy and optical coherence tomography system</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhou, Yifeng</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive optical tomographic technique based on the principle of interferometry. It can capture micrometer-resolution, three-dimensional images of tissues over millimeter field-of-view at a fast speed. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) is an emerging imaging modality based on the excitation of nonlinear signals from fluorescent molecules and the induction of second harmonic generation (SHG). It is capable of en-face high-resolution imaging with sub-micron resolution. Although OCT and MPM are essential imaging tools for disease diagnosis, each one of them has shortages, such as the low resolution of OCT and the low depth penetration of MPM. The purpose of this study is to design a multimodal imaging system by combining MPM and OCT into a single platform so that the two modalities can complement and overcome the shortages of each other. The design consists of two parts: hardware and software. For hardware, the two modalities are integrated into a single platform, sharing the laser source, the controlling scanners and the sample arm. In addition, the OCT has a reference arm for interference and a custom-built spectrometer for signal detection, whereas the MPM uses two photomultiplier tubes (PMT) for photon detection. For software, two user interfaces are specially designed to control beam scanning and data acquisition of the MPM and OCT respectively. The performance of this mutlimodal system is demonstrated by imaging biological samples. The results indicate that our system is capable of multiscale imaging of multilayered tissues with clear structures. One of the important applications of the multimodal system is measuring the refractive index (RI) and thickness of biological tissues. This capability is demonstrated on fish cornea. The results show our system is capable of imaging as well as quantitative characterization of RI and thickness of multilayered biological tissues. This system can potentially be a powerful tool for disease detection and surgery treatment.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Measurement of an off-axis neutrino beam energy spectrum</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kirby, Brian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The T2K long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment is designed to measure the neutrino flavour mixing parameter θ₁₃, as well as θ₂₃ and Δm²₂₃ with twenty times greater precision than previous measurements. A neutrino beam is produced using the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) proton accelerator in Tokai, Japan and is incident on the Super-Kamiokande water Cherenkov detector 295 km away beam at an off-axis angle of 2.5°. A suite of near detectors 280 m away from the proton target (ND280) provides additional constraints on beam flux estimates as well as measures neutrino interaction cross sections. A critical component of ND280 is a Fine Grained Detector (FGD) that provides an active target for neutrino interactions, with sufficient granularity to reconstruct short ranged particle tracks. This thesis describes the T2K experiment, the design and calibration of the FGD, and its online data reduction system. A cut-based selection for charged current neutrino interactions is used to produce quasi-elastic and non-quasi-elastic enhanced samples. These samples are used in a maximum likelihood fit to measure the T2K neutrino beam energy spectrum. The fit determines the flux scale factors that best reproduce the kinematic distribution of muons produced in selected interactions, and accounts for all relevant neutrino interaction model and detector systematic uncertainties. The fitted flux factors f(Eν) in the energy ranges defined for the analysis are as follows: f(0 &lt; Eν &lt; 0.5GeV ) = 1.10⁺⁰·²⁸₋₀.₂₄, f(0.5 &lt; Eν &lt; 1.0GeV ) = 0.93⁺⁰·¹⁷₋₀.₁₄, f(1.0 &lt; Eν &lt; 3.5GeV ) = 0.85⁺⁰·¹⁷₋₀.₁₄, f(Eν &gt; 3.5GeV ) = 0.92⁺⁰·²⁸₋₀.₂₃. These flux factors are consistent with the default neutrino beam flux prediction and the flux measurement used in the primary oscillation analysis of the T2K collaboration, and provide an independent confirmation that the neutrino beam flux model is reliable.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Measurements of neutrino interactions on water using a fine-grained scintillator detector with water targets</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Brook-Roberge, Daniel Grant</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Measurements of neutrino interaction cross-sections are important for the study of neutrino oscillations. For the T2K experiment, which has a near detector with a primarily carbon target and a far detector with an oxygen target, the cross-section difference is important for correctly comparing the neutrino fluxes at the two detectors. This dissertation presents a first measurement of the ratio between oxygen and carbon of the muon neutrino charge-current inclusive cross-section using the T2K near detector, ND280. The design and construction methods of the water target system in the ND280 Fine-Grained Detector (FGD) will be discussed, as will a new algorithm for reconstructing particle tracks contained within the FGD. The data analysis leading to the cross-section ratio measurement will be described. It is based on a statistical subtraction method which extracts the contribution of the FGD water mass to the total interaction rate for the FGD with water targets. We find an oxygen/carbon ratio of 1.129 ± 0.114 (stat) ± 0.044 (syst) from the ND280 data, a 1.39σ difference from the Monte Carlo prediction of 0.954 ± 0.029.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nonperturbative quantum field theory in astrophysics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mazur, Daniel Paul</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The extreme electromagnetic or gravitational fields associated with some astrophysical objects can give rise to macroscopic effects arising from the physics of the quantum vacuum. Therefore, these objects are incredible laboratories for exploring the physics of quantum field theories. In this dissertation, we explore this idea in three astrophysical scenarios. In the early universe, quantum fluctuations of a scalar field result in the generation of particles, and of the density fluctuations which seed the large- scale structure of the universe. These fluctuations are generated through quantum processes, but are ultimately treated classically. We explore how a quantum-to-classical transition may occur due to non-linear self-interactions of the scalar field. This mechanism is found to be too inefficient to explain classicality, meaning fields which do not become classical because of other mechanisms may maintain some evidence of their quantum origins. Magnetars are characterized by intense magnetic fields. In these fields, the quantum vacuum becomes a non-linear optical medium because of interactions between light and quantum fluctuations of electron-positron pairs. In addition, there is a plasma surrounding the magnetar which is a dissipative medium. We construct a numerical simulation of electromagnetic waves in this environment which is non-perturbative in the wave amplitudes and background field. This simulation reveals a new class of waves with highly non-linear structure that are stable against shock formation. The dense nuclear material in a neutron star is expected to be in a type-II superconducting state. In that case, the star’s intense magnetic fields will penetrate the core and crust through a dense lattice of flux tubes. However, depending on the details of the free energy associated with these flux tubes, the nuclear material may be in a type-I state which completely expels the field. We compute the quantum corrections to the classical energies of these flux tubes by creating a new, massively parallel Monte-Carlo simulation. The quantum contribution tends to make a small contribution which adds to the classical free energy. We also find a non-local interaction energy with a sign that depends on the field profile and spacing between flux tubes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Low-temperature thermochronology of the northern Carlin Trend : evidence for Late Cretaceous exhumation of northern central Nevada and short duration of Carlin ore-forming hydrothermal systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cruickshanks, Moira</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Samples were collected from Jurassic intrusions in the northern Carlin Trend to determine the thermal history of the region that was strongly affected by Late Cretaceous exhumation and Eocene hydrothermal fluid flow. Low-temperature apatite fission track and apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronology of the northern Carlin Trend records 3-4 km exhumation since the Late Jurassic. At least 1-2 km exhumation occurred during a phase of rapid exhumation between 85-60 Ma that is coincident with extensional collapse of the overthickened hinterland of the Sevier orogeny. Late Cretaceous exhumation ages provide a background against which ~40 Ma thermal anomalies associated with the formation of the Carlin-type Au deposits can be observed. In the northern Carlin Trend, a thermal halo defined by apatite fission track resetting was observed up to 400 m out from major fluid flow conduits around the Goldstrike Stock that is immediately south of the multi-million ounce Betze-Post deposit. A lack of hydrothermal alteration within the stock shows that Eocene hydrothermal fluid flow was concentrated around its edge, and that heating of the stock was predominantly conductive. Finite element modelling and forward modelling of time-temperature paths constrain the duration of a hydrothermal fluid event to on order of 10 kyr. Multiple phases of this duration of fluid flow are possible, but were either thermally isolated or were shorter-lived. The high rates of fluid flux associated with short fluid flow durations are similar to those observed in hydrothermal systems driven by forced convection or pressure-driven flow, suggesting fluid flow responsible for the formation of Carlin-type Au deposits was driven by a magmatic source or seismicity rather than free convection.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>New solid state laser crystals created by epitaxial growth</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kumaran, Raveen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Rare-earth-doped oxide crystals such as Nd:YAG are often used as the gain medium in solid state lasers because they produce a collection of sharp emission peaks, some of which have strong gain. Rather than the typical bulk form of these crystals, thin films with planar waveguide geometry are promising alternatives for compact devices with lower lasing thresholds and better heat extraction. Such benefits motivated the growth of these oxide films by molecular beam epitaxy, a technique capable of films with precise composition, thickness and structure due to its independently controlled elemental sources. Two sets of material systems were attempted, Al-Ga-O and Y-Al-O, with Nd as the sole dopant. The films were grown on sapphire substrates of various orientations, then analyzed by x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence where peaks signaled long-range and short-range order respectively. Work on the Al-Ga-O system yielded Nd:α-Al₂O₃ (Nd:sapphire) and Nd:α-Ga₂O₃, two new laser crystals with unique collections of sharp emission peaks only observable from single-crystal films grown at temperatures far below the melting point. These conditions were required to confine the much-larger Nd dopants into Al and Ga sites with short-range order, and are unlikely reproducible by bulk methods. Due to their shared corundum structure, the emission spectra from Nd:sapphire and Nd:α-Ga₂O₃ appear similar but wavelength-shifted. The dominant Nd:sapphire peak has strong gain comparable to its counterpart from Nd:YVO₄, one of the highest available, while the blue-shifted Nd:α-Ga₂O₃ peak is likewise comparable to Nd:YAG. Alloying both produced corundum-structure crystals with peaks that shifted linearly with unit cell volume, which in turn depended on Ga/Al ratio and film stress. These Al-Ga-O crystals are promising for applications involving compositional-tuning and graded-index layers. Ternary Y-Al-O is not tunable because it has three stable phases YAM, YAP and YAG with different compositions, structures and thus emission spectra. Single-phase films of each phase were grown without single-crystal structure but still yielded sharp peaks consistent with their bulk counterparts. Short-range order was achievable because the Nd dopants were size-compatible with the Y sites. While the peaks did not shift with Y/Al ratio, peak sharpness improved when the ratio approached bulk stoichiometric values.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The application of symmetry methods and conservation laws to ordinary differential equations and a linear wave equation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hoskins, Jeremy G.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Symmetry analysis and conservation laws are widely used in analyzing and solving differential equations. Conservation laws are also called first integrals when dealing with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this thesis, the complementary nature of these two approaches is explored; specifically, the use of symmetries to find integrating factors and, conversely, the use of conservation laws to seek new symmetries. In Part 1, building upon results in [3] and [10], it is shown that a higher-order symmetries of an ODE induces a point symmetry of the corresponding integrating factor determining equations (IFDE), and an explicit expression for this induced symmetry is obtained. Secondly, it is shown that the converse also holds for a special class of Lie point symmetries of the IFDE; namely, all Lie point symmetries of the IFDE which are of this form project onto point symmetries of the original scalar ODE. In Part 2, the use of conservation laws to find non-local symmetries is shown for a linear one-dimensional wave equation in a two-layered medium with a smooth transition layer. The resulting analytic solutions are then studied in order to investigate the effect of the transmission and reflection of energy between the two media. It is found that the reflection and transmission coefficients depend on the ratio of the wave speeds in the two media as well as the ratio of the characteristic length of the incoming signal to the width of the transition layer. Approximations of the dependence of the reflection and transmission coefficients on these two parameters are also presented, obtained via numerical experiments performed using both the analytic solution and a finite element method.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Non-singlet sectors of the c=1 matrix model with connections to two dimensional string theory</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rabideau, Charles</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The goal of this thesis is to study non-singlet sectors of the c=1 matrix model in order to determine their connection with string theory in two space-time dimensions. It is well understood that the singlet sector of this matrix model is related to the closed string sector of the string theory. The adjoint sector has been connected to long strings stretching from an FZZT brane at infinity. The goal is to find a sector which includes a large number of these long strings which condense to form an FZZT brane in line with a proposal due to Gaiotto. Sectors corresponding to symmetric and antisymmetric tensor products of the fundamental and antifundamental representation of the U(N) symmetry of the matrix model are studied. Partition functions of the matrix model with a harmonic oscillator potential as well as bases for the Hilbert spaces are found for all these sectors. The first two representations are studied using a collective field approach with the inverted oscillator potential applicable to the c=1 model and are found to contain large numbers of long strings which form a free bosonic gas in the large N limit and so do not condense. On the other hand, in the third sector the degrees of freedom are fermionic and a shift in the ground state energy is found in the harmonic oscillator potential, which points to the existence of a Fermi sea and the condensation of the long strings. A collective field that can be used to study this sector is proposed and the technical difficulties presented by the study of this sector are discussed, but its study is left for future work.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Advances in terahertz frequency combs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Stead, Robert A.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Following a review of the theory of terahertz generation via optical rectification in nonlinear crystals, a method for enhancing the nonlinear conversion efficiency of this process is proposed. A nonlinear crystal is placed at the intracavity focus of a passive optical resonator, which is seeded by an ytterbium-doped fibre laser. Models of this arrangement indicate that an enhancement of the optical field of several orders of magnitude is possible. As the difference frequency radiation produced through the optical rectification process results from a mixing of the spectral components of the optical field, one expects a corresponding increase in the terahertz field. We present a design of optical resonator that compensates for the large group velocity dispersion of the nonlinear crystal. Our experimental results indicate that below bandgap absorption in the crystal severely limits the resulting enhancement of the optical field, and hence the terahertz field one would expect from this nonlinear process. A scanning-delay terahertz time-domain spectrometer has been constructed, using a gallium phosphide guiding structure to increase the interaction length of the optical and terahertz fields, thereby increasing the terahertz power produced. Our experiment demonstrates 20 dB signal to noise ratio over the spectral range of 0.5-1 THz. We propose a method for increasing the spectral resolution, whilst simultaneously reducing the required data acquisition time of such a terahertz spectrometer, through the use of two femtosecond optical frequency combs. One of these fields drives the nonlinear optical rectification process, whilst the second serves as a sampling local oscillator field to probe the terahertz field via electro-optic sampling in a second nonlinear crystal. By precisely controlling the relative pulse repetition rates of the two oscillators, we show that the full spectral content of the terahertz field can be acquired at rf frequencies, and without the slow mechanical delay lines associated with conventional terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. Finally, we present experimental efforts towards the demonstration of this technique, and show that, to be effective, steps must be taken to increase the strength of the expected rf signal over that of the measurement noise floor.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Absolute value of the magnetic penetration depth and field profile in the Meissner state of exotic superconductors Yttrium barium copper oxide and Co-doped pnictide</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hossain, Md Masrur</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>One of the fundamental quantities of a superconductor is the magnetic penetration depth, λ, which is the characteristic length scale that a magnetic field penetrates into the surface of a superconductor while in the Meissner state. In the clean limit the absolute value of λ is directly related to the superfluid density ns via 1/λ² = μοe²ns/m∗ , where m∗ is the effective mass. Consequently, its variation as a function of temperature, doping and orientation are of central importance in testing microscopic theories of exotic superconductors. A low energy beam of spin polarized muons has recently been developed, at the Paul Scherrrer Institute, to directly measure λ in a superconductor. When a muon (μ+) decays, it emits a fast decay positron preferentially along the direction of its spin due to the parity violating decay. The time evolution of statistical average direction of the spin polarization of the muon ensemble depends sensitively on the local magnetic field which can be monitored as a function of the mean depth of implantation. In this way it is possible to measure the field profile near the surface of a superconductor and extract the magnetic penetration depth in a direct manner which is not otherwise possible with conventional bulk methods. In this thesis, accurate measurements of λ and its anisotropy (≡ λa /λb) have been made for three different oxygen (x = 6.52, 6.92 and 6.998) contents of YBa₂Cu₃O₆₊x as well as in Ba(Co₀.₀₇₄Fe₀.₉₂₆₎₂As₂. The measured values of λ and the in-plane anisotropies are considerably different from that reported in the literature, using less direct methods. The a – b anisotropy is surprisingly insensitive to x in YBa₂Cu₃O₆₊x . We observe an exponential decay of the magnetic field and corresponding supercurrent density deep inside the crystals. Small deviations from the London model are observed which indicate there is a suppression of the supercurrent density close to the surface. The measured (λ) values are also found to depart substantially from the Uemura relation Tcα 1/λ² .</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Acquisition of transparent refractive media</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Atcheson, Bradley</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Transparent refractive media are invisible but for the distortions they impart upon a background scene. Computerised acquisition of such media can therefore often not be performed via traditional scanning methods. By capturing refracted backgrounds rather than reflections off the target media itself, we develop techniques for reconstructing the intervening refractive index distribution for both static and time-varying media. The approach is based on tracking optical distortions and then performing tomographic reconstruction. For multi-view tomography we first require a suitably calibrated camera array. To this end we show how to temporally synchronise and geometrically calibrate an array of consumer-grade video cameras that can scale to larger sizes, and at lower cost, than a comparative array of machine vision cameras. For media of low dynamic refractive index range, such as mixing gases, we show how to acquire data and formulate a linear least-squares problem to solve for the refractive index distribution. Unlike traditional methods of fluid flow measurement, ours is non-invasive and fully volumetric. For materials of higher dynamic refractive index range, we develop an alternative acquisition method based on temporally-encoded structured light patterns. Media causing significant distortion of light rays give rise to a large, nonlinear inverse problem. Results indicate that grid resolution relative to the minimum refractive feature size is a key factor limiting the accuracy of reconstructions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Beta-detected NMR of ⁸Li⁺ in spintronic materials</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Song, Qun</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>β-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (βNMR) employs radioactive ⁸Li⁺ , which is optically spin-polarized, as a local probe to study magnetism in materials via β decay. In this thesis, βNMR is applied to spintronic materials, including GaAs, Ga₁₋xMnx Asand Fe/GaAs heterostructures in a depth-controlled manner at TRIUMF. High resolution β-NMR measurements were carried out on GaAs crystals (semi-insulating (SI-GaAs) and heavily doped n-type (n-GaAs)) as a control experiment for β-NMR on Fe/GaAs heterostructures. A small resonance shift was observed and found to be dependent on depth, temperature and doping. The depth dependence is only observed in SI-GaAs and not in n-GaAs. The resonance shift below 150 K in both GaAs is ∼ 100 ppm, on the same order of some Knight shifts of ⁸Li⁺ in noble metals. Ga₁₋xMnxAs is the first βNMR study on a ferromagnetic material through the ferromagnetic transition. Both spin lattice relaxation (SLR) and resonance of ⁸Li⁺ were measured. Two resonances were clearly resolved from the nonmagnetic GaAs substrate and the magnetic Ga₁₋xMnxAs film. The latter one negatively shifts and is linearly proportional to the applied field. The hyperfine coupling constant AHF of ⁸Li⁺ in Ga₁₋xMnxAs is found to be negative. The SLR rate λ does not follow Korringa’s Law and its amplitude shows a weak temperature dependence through TC. The behaviours of AHF and λ suggest that the delocalized holes originate from a Mn derived impurity band. No evidence of magnetic phase separation is found. ⁸Li⁺ provides a new depth-dependent local probe to detect injected spin polarization. We measured the ⁸Li⁺ resonance in Fe/GaAs heterostructures with semi-insulating and heavily doped n-type substrates, with and without injected current. With zero current, no spin polarization at thermal equilibrium is found. A new current injection system was designed and setup to conduct current injection from the thin Fe layer into the n-GaAs substrate. We found effects of local Joule heating and a very small stray field caused by the injected current but no convincing evidence of injected spin polarization.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An optical functional analysis of amorphous semiconductors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Minar, Sanjida Begum</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Models for the spectral dependence of the real and imaginary components of the dielectric function, appropriate for the case of amorphous semiconductors,are considered. In the first phase of this analysis, from an empirical expression for the imaginary part of the dielectric function, this expression corresponding to that of Jellison and Modine [G. E. Jellison, Jr. and F. A. Modine, "Parameterization of the optical functions of amorphous materials in the interband region," Applied Physics Letters, vol. 69, pp. 371-373, 1996],a closed-form expression for the real part of the dielectric function is determined using a Kramers-Kronig transformation. The resultant expression for the real component of the dielectric function corresponds with that of the model of Jellison and Modine. The subsequent comparison with experiment is found to be satisfactory. Then, in the latter stage of this analysis, through the application of a Kramers-Kronig transformation on an empirical model for the imaginary part of the dielectric function, this model stemming from a model for the distributions of electronic states, the spectral dependence of the real part of the dielectric function is determined. Fits with the results of experiment, taken over the near-infrared, visible, and near-ultraviolet, are also found to be satisfactory.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Phase transitions in the neighbourhood of mean field theory</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Timmers, Dennis</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We study systems consisting of interacting spin particles which can have a positive or negative spin. We consider an Ising model and a type of Widom-Rowlinson (WR) model. The interactions between spin particles are regulated by Kac potentials which carry a parameter ɣ. It is known that in the Kac limit, as ɣ tends to zero, models with Kac potentials become mean field theory. Mean field theory is known to exhibit phase transitions. The focus of this work is to prove phase transitions not only in the Kac limit but also near the Kac limit i.e., for ɣ small but strictly positive. Placing the Ising and WR model in a rectangular box with side-length L and periodic boundary conditions defines finite volume Gibbs measures. The infinite volume Gibbs state ν is the limit of the finite volume Gibbs measures as L tends to infinity. A particle system exhibits a phase transition if ν is a mixture of ergodic states. The main achievement of this thesis is the development of a new method to prove phase transitions. We first apply the Kac-Siegert transformation which reformulates the particle system by introducing an auxiliary field. The spin-spin interactions are replaced by interactions of the spin particles with the auxiliary field. The main idea of this dissertation is to study the mean auxiliary field. In principle it should be easier to work with the mean field because, as we will show, it is approximately Gaussian. By a new expansion around mean field theory we prove that for ɣ strictly positive but small the infinite volume Gibbs state for the auxiliary field, for both the Ising and the WR model, is a mixture of two ergodic states. It is shown that this implies that the infinite volume Gibbs state for both the Ising and WR model is a mixture of two ergodic states. One Gibbs state predominantly has positive spin particles, the other Gibbs state predominantly has negative spin particles. The new expansion is related to the Glimm Jaffe Spencer expansion around mean field theory.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Unconventional Peierls physics in underdoped Bi2201</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rosen, Jonathan Adam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The puzzling physics of the high-temperature superconducting cuprates has led to many important questions and investigations regarding the mechanism of high-Tc's. This dissertation demonstrates that, through detailed experimental studies using angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), a new type of periodic structural distortion exists in Bi₂Sr₂-xLaxCuO₆₊d (La-Bi2201), leading to the existence of multiple periodic lattice distortions (PLD) in the underdoped material. Photon-energy dependent ARPES reveals photoelectron diffraction effects that exhibit all relevant length scales as oscillations in the ARPES matrix element, leading to the observation of all of the diffraction-replica (DR) bands associated with the multiple PLD's. Furthermore, a charge-density-wave (CDW) associated with the new PLD at the crystal surface with a temperature-dependent wavelength is observed. A Ginzburg-Landau mean field model is shown to exhibit the same temperature-dependence from a combination of Fermi surface nesting and lattice commensurability affected by the temperature-dependent harmonic content of the CDW. A detailed temperature-dependence of the antinodal pseudogap reveals two simultaneous energy and temperature scales: one associated with the CDW, and the other in agreement with the magneto-optical Kerr effect and magnetic neutron diffraction results in the literature. Detailed nodal ARPES lineshapes reveal a peak in the real-part of the self-energy that coincides with band-crossing positions and the nodal ''kink'' energies for all dopings, providing evidence that these disparate features can be collectively explained by band hybridization allowed in the fully incommensurate crystal, which does not preserve parity. This provides one route to explain these phenomena - as a product of nested van-Hove singularities along the nodal line in underdoped La-Bi2201, which result in a Peierls distortion similar to the dichalcogenide CDW superconductors.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Feasibility test of exotic particle searches in the decay of trapped rubidium isomers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kong, Tao</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We tested the feasibility of searching for exotic particle emissions in the decay of trapped Rb isomers by measuring the recoiling momentum of the decay daughters. Massive particle emissions would cause the daughters to recoil at a momentum less than the case of a photon emission, and show up as a lower peak in the recoiling momentum spectrum. ⁸⁶mRb isomer decay (6- → 2-) was chosen as the experimental subject, which allows a search for 0⁺ and 1- massive particles with a mass range between 0 and 556 keV/c². To measure the recoiling momentum of the neutral Rb-⁸⁶g decay daughters, they must first be photoionized to be collected by the spectrometer and detected by the MCP detectors. The photoionization scheme is a two-stepwise procedure, including Doppler-free two-photon transitions from the 5S₁/₂ to 5D₅/₂ states by a 778 nm laser, and from the 5D₅/₂ state into continuum by a 1064 nm laser. The recoiling momenta of the Rb-⁸⁶g decay daughters were reconstructed by measuring the Rb ions' time-of-flight and transverse displacements on the ion detector. The achieved momentum resolution for the 556 keV/c photoions is 15(3) keV/c, which is twice the expectation due to the sagging of the spectrometer mesh. Because of the photoionization rate limitation, the achieved sensitivity is at 10% decay branch compared to gamma emissions. A feasibility study to improve the sensitivity to 10-⁵ level is outlined and compared to the conventional experiments in this field. The exotic particle search experiment requires the isotope shift knowledge for efficiently driving Doppler-free two-photon transitions in radioactive Rb isotopes. In total, we measured isotope shifts of the 5S₁/₂ to 5D₅/₂ transition for three Rb isotopes, δν{⁸⁶m,⁸⁷} = -69.46(3) MHz, δν{⁸⁶g,⁸⁷} = -83.62(2) MHz and δν{⁸¹g,⁸⁷} = -552.34(27) MHz. The precision we achieved in the isotope shift measurements allows us to deduce the specific mass shifts between the 5S₁/₂ and 5D₅/₂ states with 4 - 28 MHz precision by making a King plot. This provides a benchmark for the isotope shift calculations needed for the cosmological tests of time and space variations of the fine structure constant Alpha by astrophysical spectroscopy of alkali-like species.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>m-Liouville theorems and regularity results for elliptic PDEs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Fazly, Mostafa</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis which is a compendium of seven papers, focuses on the study of the semilinear elliptic equations and systems, on both bounded and unbounded domains of dimension n, most importantly the Allen-Cahn equation and the De Giorgi’s conjecture (1978). This conjecture brings together two groups of mathematicians: one specializing in nonlinear partial differential equations and another in differential geometry, more specifically on minimal surfaces and constant mean curvature surfaces. De Giorgi conjectured that the monotone and bounded solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation on the whole space of dimension n ≤ 8 must be 1-dimensional solutions. This is known to be true for n ≤ 3 and with extra (natural) assumptions for 4 ≤ n ≤ 8. Motivated by this conjecture, I have introduced two main concepts: The first concept is the “H-monotone solutions” that allows us to formulate a counterpart of the De Giorgi’s conjecture for system of equations stating that the H-monotone and bounded solutions of the gradient systems on the whole space of dimension n ≤ 8 must be 1-dimensional solutions. This seems to be in the right track to extend the De Giorgi's conjecture to systems. The second concept is the “m-Liouville theorem” for m = 0, · · · , n − 1 that allows us to formulate a counterpart of the De Giorgi’s conjecture for equations but this time for higher-dimensional solutions as opposed to 1-dimensional solutions. We use the induction idea that is to use 0-Liouville theorem (0- dimensional solutions) to prove 1-Liouville theorem (1-dimensional solutions) and then to prove (n − 1)- Liouville theorem ((n − 1)-dimensional solutions). The reason that we call this “m-Liouville theorem” is because of the great mathematician Joseph Liouville (1809-1882) who proved a classical theorem in complex analysis stating that "bounded harmonic functions on the whole space must be constant" and constants are 0-dimensional objects. 0-Liouville theorem is at the heart of this thesis and it includes various 0-Liouville theorems for various equations and system. In particular, we give a positive answer to the Henon-Lane-Emden conjecture in dimension three under an extra boundedness assumption. On the other hand, it is well known that there is a close relationship between the regularity of solutions on bounded domains and 0-Liouville theorem for related “limiting equations” on the whole space, via rescaling and blow up procedures. In this direction, we present regularity of solutions for gradient and twisted-gradient systems as well as the uniqueness results for nonlocal eigenvalue problems. The novelty here is a stability inequality for both gradient and twisted-gradient systems that gives us the chance to adjust the known techniques and ideas (for equations) to systems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Coherent optical wireless communications over atmospheric turbulence channels</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Niu, Mingbo</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Recent advances in free-space optics have made outdoor optical wireless communication (OWC) an attractive solution to the “last-mile” problem of broadband access networks. Significant chal- lenges can, however, arise for OWC links with increased levels of atmospheric turbulence from time-varying temperatures and pressures. As a promising alternative to the current generation of on-off keying (OOK) direct detection based OWC system, the coherent OWC system is studied in this thesis for a variety of turbulence conditions. Since coherent OWC system performance is found to be impaired severely under strong turbulence conditions, spatial diversity techniques, e.g., maximum ratio combining (MRC), equal gain combining (EGC), and selection combining (SC), are adopted to overcome turbulence impacts. The results are then generalized to Gamma-Gamma turbulence for MRC and EGC with perfect channel or phase estimation. The impacts of phase noise compensation error on coherent OWC system performance are investigated, and it is found that such impacts can be small when the standard deviation of the phase noise compensation error is kept below twenty degrees. A postdetection EGC scheme using differential phase-shift keying (PSK) is proposed and is shown to be a viable alternative to overcome phase noise impacts. The subcarrier intensity modulation (SIM) based OWC system has been proposed as another alternative to the OOK system. With a unified average signal-to-noise ratio definition, system per- formance is compared for coherent and SIM links over the Gamma-Gamma turbulence channels. Closed-form error rate expressions are derived for coherent and SIM systems using MRC, EGC and SC schemes. It is found that the coherent systems outperform the SIM systems significantly. The benefits of coherent systems come chiefly from the large local oscillator power which eliminates the effects of the thermal and ambient noises that dominate in SIM systems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Microfabricated electromagnetic actuators for confocal measurements and imaging</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mansoor, Hadi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Various optical microscopy techniques have been developed for micrometer level imaging of biological tissue samples. Among those techniques, confocal imaging provides superior image contrast and high resolution with a modest system cost. Confocal microscopy allows vertical optical sectioning (imaging a section perpendicular to the surface of tissue) or horizontal optical sectioning (imaging a section parallel to the surface of tissue) and provides high-resolution tissue morphology that is analogous to conventional histopathology images. This has brought up a tremendous potential for guiding surgical biopsies and in vivo non-invasive diagnosis of diseases such as cancer. The challenge in moving microscopic imaging modalities into clinical applications is miniaturization into a form of hand-held devices or catheters for endoscopic applications. In this thesis, micro-fabrication techniques such as Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication process and laser micromachining have been employed to develop magnetic actuators. The actuators are then used to move lenses and optical fibers in order to scan a laser beam across a sample. Lens and fiber actuators are integrated in catheter and hand-held devices for confocal thickness measurement and optical sectioning imaging of biological samples. Thickness measurement is performed by scanning the focal point of a microlens across the thickness of thin films or layered biological tissues and collecting the intensity signal of the single scattering light reflected back from the samples as a function of lens position. A catheter was developed and thickness measurements of polymer layers and biological tissues were demonstrated. The device has optical resolution of 32 µm with expanded uncertainty of measurement of 11.86 µm. Lens and fiber optic actuators have been coupled to form two-dimensional imaging devices. Direct and real-time vertical and horizontal cross-sectional imaging of biological samples has been demonstrated. Vertical imaging is performed by transverse (X-axis) and axial (Z-axis) scanning of a focused laser beam using an optical fiber and a microlens actuator respectively. Horizontal imaging is done by a 2-axis fiber optic scanner. All the developed actuators are driven by electromagnetic forces and require low driving voltages. Confocal imaging of biological samples, with lateral resolution of 1.55 µm, has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on unconventional superconductor strontium ruthenate</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Veenstra, Christian Neil</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis represents two bodies of work: a detailed look at what angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measures, as well as ARPES and circularly polarized photon spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (CPS-ARPES) measurements on the unconventional superconductor Sr₂RuO₄. In the first part I present a study of both established methods of ARPES analysis and some new variations on model spectral functions. This modelling was done in a realistic regime, yet far from the limits often assumed. Away from these limits I show that any "effective coupling" inferred from quasiparticle renormalizations differs drastically and unpredictably from the true coupling. Conversely, I show that perturbation theory retains good predictive power where expected, that the momentum dependence of the self-energy can be revealed via the relationship between velocity renormalization and quasiparticle strength, and that it is often possible to infer the self-energy and bare electronic structure through lineshape analysis. In the second part I present experimental ARPES and CPS-ARPES data on Sr₂RuO₄. Newly discovered and unexplained ARPES features are characterized and compared with a variety of different possible structural distortions through bulk and slab local-density approximation (LDA) band structure calculations. I thereby rule out phases driven by electronic interaction, such as Dirac- or Rashba-type surface states, and instead find that there exists a progressive structural modulation whereby both the surface and (at a minimum) sub-surface layers exhibit a (√2 x √2)R45° reconstruction. Through CPS-ARPES on Sr₂RuO₄ I also directly demonstrate that the effects of spin-orbit (SO) coupling are not limited to a modification of the band structure, but fundamentally entangle the spin and spatial parts of the wave-function. This must drive the superconducting state in Sr₂RuO₄ to be even more unconventional than is generally assumed, with mixing between singlet and triplet states that varies around the Fermi surface, and thereby offers a possible resolution to a number of experiments that clash with the categorization of Sr₂RuO₄ as a hallmark spin-triplet chiral p-wave superconductor.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Enhancing particle methods for fluid simulation in computer graphics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Schechter, Hagit</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We introduce novel methods for enriched Lagrangian fluid simulation in three distinct areas: smoke animation, liquid animation, and surfacing of simulation particle data. The techniques share a common goal, to efficiently enhance realism of natural-phenomena animations in particle simulation framework. Sub-Grid Turbulence adds synthesized small scale detail to large scale smoke simulation. The transport, diffusion and spectral cascade of turbulent energy are captured, whereas they are left unresolved on a typical simulation grid. Ghost-SPH handling of free-surface and solid boundary conditions in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics liquid simulation captures realistic cohesion for the first time and avoids the spurious numerical errors of previous approaches. Ghost particles are carefully seeded in the air and solid regions near the fluid and are assigned with extrapolated fluid quantities to reach correct boundary conditions. The Beta Mesh is a new method for reconstructing mostly temporally coherent surface meshes from particles representing the volume of a liquid. While current particle surfacing techniques address the geometrical characteristics of the surface, the focus in Beta Mesh is producing a surface which varies smoothly in time, outside of topological changes, while preserving essential geometrical properties.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>10GHz sky survey to probe inflation with CMB polarization</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tanimura, Hideki</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background(CMB) contain a lot of information on the history and composition of our universe. In particular, the rich detail about our early universe is included in the angular power spectra of the CMB fluctuations, which constrains the cosmological parameters in current models of the universe. The latest cosmological data strongly support an inflationary Lambda CDM cosmology with a minimal six parameters to describe our universe. The next challenge in cosmology is to probe the physics of the inflationary period by looking for the signature of primordial gravitational waves in the polarized CMB. CMB polarization was generated at last scattering by scalar and tensor perturbations in the primordial fluid. The tensor perturbations are produced by the stretching of space-time by gravitational wave fluctuations, while scalar perturbations are produced by density fluctuations in the primordial fluid. The ratio of the tensor to scalar perturbation amplitude, r, is a key tracer of the physics of the inflationary epoch, which is deeply connected to the energy scale of inflation in a standard inflationary model. A local quadrupole anisotropy in the radiation field at the time of decoupling causes the linear polarization in CMB through Thomson scattering by electrons. The CMB polarization can be decomposed into two rotationally invariant quantities, called E and B. The CMB B-mode is a direct tracer of the tensor perturbations caused by gravitational waves in the inflationary period of the universe. Thus, the detection of B-mode has currently been dubbed the ''smoking gun'' of inflation. However, the galactic foreground emissions also have much stronger E- and B-modes polarization. We intend to produce half-sky maps of total intensity and linear polarization at 10 GHz. This data would probe galactic synchrotron emission and also can help constrain the so-called anomalous emission. Therefore, the maps can be used with other surveys such as WMAP and Planck to subtract galactic foreground emissions and obtain more precise CMB data. In addition, the data will give us information about galactic emission components such as synchrotron, free-free, thermal dust and anomalous emission in the microwave range.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Search for long-lived neutral particles in final states with a muon and multi-track displaced vertex with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Loh, Chang Wei</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This work presents the result of a search for a new long-lived neutral particle decaying into a muon and charged hadrons in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with a total integrated luminosity of 4.4 inverse femtobarn, using the ATLAS detector located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Many extensions to the current Standard Model of particle physics predict the existence of such new particles, including the neutralino in an R-parity violating supersymmetry scenario. In this search, a set of selection criteria has been established to be sensitive to this kind of signal, in addition to evaluating the background in a data-driven manner. No excess of events above the expected background is observed with the collected data and limits are set on the squark pair production cross section, multiplied by the branching ratio for a squark to decay, via a long-lived neutralino, to a muon and charged hadrons, as a function of the neutralino lifetime.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Characterizing magnetization exchange in healthy human brain and bovine brain</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kalantari, Saeed</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Multi component T₂ relaxation imaging is an established MRI technique for measuring myelin water (MW, water molecules trapped between myelin sheath bilayers). Myelin water fraction (MWF, the fraction of central nervous system water with a short T₂) has been quantitatively correlated to histological staining for myelin in central nervous system tissue and hence is considered an in vivo measure of myelin content. Various studies have reported on the measurement of MWF with a diverse range of neurological diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Phenylketonuria (PKU). Although T₂ relaxation is the main probe for measuring MWF, understanding longitudinal relaxation, T1, is essential in a number ways such as the following: 1) Estimation of the corrections for myelin water fraction that need to be taken into account due to water exchange processes in white matter in vivo is highly dependent on T₁ relaxation. 2) Investigating the effect of T1-weighting in MWF measurements at short TR. This is especially important due to recent breakthroughs in developing rapid 3-D whole brain approaches to MWF measurements that are pushing towards shorter and shorter TR times in order to make this technique a valuable clinical imaging tool. First, in vivo MRI data from multi-component T₂ relaxation from 57 healthy subjects collected at 3.0 T was analyzed to estimate the corrections which have to be taken into account due to magnetization exchange in white matter. These results showed that these MWF corrections were less than 15% and are uniform across various white matter structures. Next, the variation of MWF as function of repetition time (TR) was investigated using in vivo MRI data collected at 3.0 T from healthy subjects. These results clearly showed that the measured MWF increased as the TR decreased. Finally, in order to measure T₁ as well as the rate of magnetization exchange with higher precision, data from bovine brain white matter was collected using a 4.7 T NMR spectrometer. The results from this study clearly showed that the T₁ had two components; therefore magnetization in bovine white matter is not in a fast exchange regime on the T₁ timescale.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Correlated molecular plasmas</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Morrison, Jonathan P.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Ultracold neutral plasmas (UNPs) are highly correlated, charged-particle systems studied in standard atomic-molecular optical physics laboratories. Advances in ultracold physics techniques have led to the development of magneto-optical traps that permit the localization of micro-Kelvin temperature atomic samples (10⁸ - 10¹⁰ cm -³ that can be photoionized with a defined excess laser energy. Magneto-optical trapping of molecules proves difficult, and to date, lags in reaching conditions attainable for atoms. Molecules possess additional degrees of freedom where energy can flow during laser trapping and cooling. Alternatively, elastic collisions with inert gases offer another route to low temperatures. Super-sonic expansions of target molecules seeded in a noble gas can reduced the translational temperature to values as low as 0.1 K. Here I report on the formation of a molecular ultracold plasma in a molecular beam of nitric oxide seeded in an inert gas. Our method does not directly form a plasma, but instead, I create a Rydberg gas that spontaneously evolves to a plasma. I have verified the transition to a collective plasma state by applying pulsed-fields to the field-free flight region, and observe a signal that persists well beyond classical field amplitudes required to ionize individual Rydberg states. Electric field screening is a collective effect occurring over a characteristic distance, quantified by the Debye length, λ_D. Molecular ultracold plasmas described here exhibit Debye lengths smaller than the overall size, λ_D&lt;&lt;σ. Plasmas of this nature offer an exotic environment for which to study fundamental phenomena. While plasmas are generally thought of as hot, UNPs exist at low enough temperatures that electrostatic interaction energy between particles is greater than their kinetic energy. At this point, charged particles begin to find themselves in local potential energy minima. Over the entire sample this translates to long-range order, or correlation. It is of great interest for researchers studying UNPs to maximize particle correlation, which requires UNPs to remain very cold, and dense through their lifetime.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Relativistic scattering of solitons in nonlinear field theory</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gutierrez, Benjamin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents results from numerical studies of the dynamics of three classical nonlinear field theories, each of which possesses stable, localized solutions called solitons. We focus on two of the theories, known as Skyrme models, which have had application in various areas of physics. The third, which treats a complex scalar field, is principally viewed as a model problem to develop solution techniques. In all cases, time dependent, nonlinear partial differential equations in several spatial dimensions are solved computationally. Simulation of high energy collisions of the solitons is of particular interest. The solitons of the complex scalar field theory are known as Q-balls and carry a charge Q. We investigate the scattering of these objects, reproducing previous findings for collisions where the Q-balls have charge of the same sign. We obtain new results for interactions where the Q-balls have opposite charge, and for scattering of Q-balls against potential obstructions. The chief contributions of this thesis come from simulations performed within the context of a Skyrme model in two spatial dimensions. This is a multi-scalar theory with solitons known as baby skyrmions. We concentrate on the rich phenomenology seen in high-energy scattering of pairs of these objects, each of which has a topological charge that can be either positive or negative. We extend the understanding of the role of different parameters of the model in governing the outcome of head-on and off-axis collisions. The study of instabilities seen in previous simulations of Skyrme models is of central interest. Our results confirm that the governing partial differential equations become of mixed hyperbolic-elliptic type for interactions at sufficiently high-energy, as originally suggested by Crutchfield and Bell. We present strong evidence for the loss of energy conservation and smoothness of the dynamical fields in these instances. This supports the conclusion that the initial value problem at hand becomes ill-posed, so that the observed instabilities result from the nature of the equations themselves, and are not numerical artifacts. Finally, we present preliminary results for the typical phenomenology seen in head-on scattering of solitons in the Skyrme model in three spatial dimensions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Two dimensional hydrodynamic instabilities in shear flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Guha, Anirban</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Hydrodynamic instabilities occurring in two dimensional shear flows have been investigated. First, the process of resonant interaction between two progressive interfacial waves is studied. Such interaction produces exponentially growing instabilities in idealized, homogeneous or density stratified, inviscid shear layers. It is shown that two oppositely propagating interfacial waves, having arbitrary initial amplitudes and phases, eventually phase-lock, provided they satisfy a particular condition. Three types of shear instabilities - Kelvin Helmholtz, Holmboe and Taylor have been studied. The above-mentioned condition provides a range of unstable wavenumbers for each instability type, and this range matches the predictions of the canonical normal-mode based linear stability theory. The non-linear evolution of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability has been studied. The commonly known manifestation of KH is in the form of spiral billows. However, KH evolving from a piecewise linear shear layer is remarkably different; it is characterized by elliptical vortices of constant vorticity connected via thin braids. Using direct numerical simulation and contour dynamics, it is shown that the interaction between two counter-propagating vorticity waves is solely responsible for this KH formation. The oscillation of the vorticity wave amplitude, the rotation and nutation of the elliptical vortex, and straining of the braids have been investigated. Finally, the linear stability of plane Couette-Poiseuille flow in the presence of a cross-flow is studied. The base flow is characterized by the cross flow Reynolds number, Reinj and the dimensionless wall velocity, k. Corresponding to each dimensionless wall velocity, k ∈ [0,1], two ranges of Reinj exist where unconditional stability is observed. In the lower range of Reinj , for modest k we have a stabilization of long wavelengths leading to a cut-off Reinj. As Reinj is increased, we see first destabilization and then stabilization at very large Reinj. Analysis of the eigenspectrum suggests the cause of instability is due to resonant interactions of Tollmien-Schlichting waves.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical simulation of interfacial flows in micropores</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ahmadlouydarab, Majid</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Recent technological developments in microfluidics and fuel cells have given special significance to interfacial dynamics in small pores. Using a diffuse-interface model and a finite-element code, I have simulated three associated problems numerically: gas-liquid flow regimes in micropores; relative permeability for two-phase flow through a model porous medium; and dynamics of sessile drops under the simultaneous action of a wettability gradient and an external flow. For two-phase flows in corrugated microchannels driven by a pressure drop, a number of flow regimes were observed: gas flow, blockage, liquid flow, bubble-slug flow, droplet flow, annular flow and annular-droplet flow. Some of the regimes are known from prior studies in macroscopic pipes, but the others are new and specific to the micropores. Then a map of flow regimes has been constructed in the plane of the liquid saturation and the imposed pressure drop. The transitions among certain flow regimes show significant hysteresis, largely owing to the pinning of the interface at sharp corners in the flow conduit. As an extension of the above study, I computed the relative permeability of a model porous media made of corrugated tubes, using an averaging scheme over a pore-size-distribution of a real porous medium. I discovered that the flow rates vary nonlinearly with the pressure gradient, and that the extended Darcy's law does not hold in general. In the third project, I found that for each prescribed wetting gradient, there is a narrow range for the cross flow within which a stationary drop can be achieved. The drop motion exhibits strong hysteresis, i.e. sensitivity to initial conditions and forcing history. Two drops merge or separate depending on the competition between wettability and external flow. In general, the wettability gradient favors catch-up and coalescence while the external flow favors separation. These numerical simulations have demonstrated that novel interfacial dynamics can be produced in micropores where capillary forces and contact line dynamics play more important roles than in larger spatial dimensions. The numerical results may serve as guidelines to future experiments and technological development in microfluidics and lab-on-chip devices.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Displacement flow of complex fluids in an inclined duct</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Alba, Kamran</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis studies buoyant displacement flows with two miscible fluids in pipes and 2D channels that are inclined at an angle β measured from vertical changing from 0° to 90°. The focus is on inclination angles away from nearly horizontal since these flows are previously studied in full details in the literature. Detailed experimental, analytical and computational approaches are employed in an integrated fashion. Both density stable (light fluid displacing heavy one) and density unstable (heavy fluid displacing light fluid) displacements are studied. For density stable flows the study is purely experimental in the limit of iso-viscous Newtonian fluids. The density stable configuration has been found to produce highly efficient displacements, with the bulk of the interface moving steadily at the mean velocity. The streamwise length of the stretched interface increases with the mean flow velocity, viscosity and inclination β from vertical, and decreases with density difference. The rest of the thesis deals with density unstable configuration. From experimental point of view, the pipe displacement flows are studied for iso-viscous Newtonian and also viscoplastic fluids. In the Newtonian limit, completely different regimes than nearly-horizontal case are observed. As a first order approximation, different regimes are classified in a two-dimensional (Fr; Re cosβ/Fr plane) providing leading order correlations to transitions to different regimes. Similar regimes are found for channel geometry through numerical simulations of PELICANS code. For non-Newtonian fluids we have focused on industrially interesting cases of large yield stress fluids in the pipe. The two distinct flow regimes namely central-type and slump-type first observed in nearly horizontal angles were found to also persist over other inclinations. Completely new and exotic behaviors were also observed due to the effect of inclination angle and instabilities. From mathematical and modeling point of view a two-layer weighted residual model for generalized Newtonian fluids has been developed. The model works for channel geometry and can be used to predict the displacement interface height, the front velocity and more importantly, the flow stability.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hydrodynamic interaction between cylinders at moderate Reynolds numbers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Biswas, Anupam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The hydrodynamic interaction between two cylinders perpendicular to the freestream, in a tandem arrangement was studied for moderate Reynolds numbers (1≤Re≤40). The influence of multiple geometric variables was considered: separation distances between the cylinders, ellipticity of the cylinders, the cylinder aspect ratio, and the angular inclination between the cylinders. In the first part of this study, a numerical investigation of the two-dimensional steady flow past cylinders was carried out. The characteristic length, D, in all simulations was taken to be twice the major axis of the cylinder cross-section, (i.e. equal to the diameter for cylinders of circular cross-section). The two-dimensional flow was studied for separations up to 50D. Four different ellipticities were studied. The drags experienced by front and rear cylinders were compared with that experienced by a single cylinder of the same cross-section. The second part of the study consisted of the steady three-dimensional flow analysis for parallel cylinders in tandem for separations ranging from 2D to 20D and cylinder lengths up to 20D. In the third part of this thesis, a steady flow analysis was done for two circular cylinders in tandem with lengths equal to 5D but with the cylinder axes in different orientations relative to the plane normal to the flow. This angular separation between the cylinders produces a hydrodynamic moment, which is dependent on the geometry and the flow Reynolds number. The fourth and final part of this work is the study of the unsteady three-dimensional flow that would result from the hydrodynamic moment discussed in relation to the third part of the thesis. The thesis closes with some remarks on the implications of these findings to papermaking and recommendations for future work.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Applications of the gauge/gravity duality</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Whyte, Kevin Robert Leslie</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>While varied applications of gauge/gravity duality have arisen in literature from studies of condensed matter systems including superconductivity to studies of quenched Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), this thesis focuses on applications of the duality to holographic QCD-like ﬁeld theories and to inflationary model that uses a QCD-like ﬁeld theory. In particular the first half of the thesis examines a holographic QCD-like ﬁeld theory with scalar quarks closely related to the Sakai-Sugimoto model of holographic QCD. The behaviour of baryons and mesons in the model is examined to find a continuous mass spectrum for the mesons, and a baryon that can identified with a topological charge. It then slightly modifies the theory to further study the behaviour of holographic ﬁeld theories. The second half of the thesis presents a novel model for early Universe inflation, using an SU(N) gauge ﬁeld theory as the inflaton. The inflation model is studied at both weak coupling and strong coupling using the gauge/gravity duality. The robustness of model’s predictions to exciting multiple inflationary fields beyond the single ﬁeld of its original proposal, and its possible role in breaking the supersymmetry of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is also explored.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Observation of laminar-turbulent transition of a yield stress fluid in Hagen-Poiseuille flow</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Guzel, Bulent</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The main focus of this work is to investigate experimentally the transition to turbulence of a yield stress shear thinning fluid in Hagen-Poiseuille flow. By combining direct high speed imaging of the flow structures with Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), we provide a systematic description of the different flow regimes from laminar to fully turbulent. Each flow regime is characterized by measurements of the radial velocity, velocity fluctuations, and turbulence intensity profiles. In addition we estimate the autocorrelation, the probability distribution, and the structure functions in an attempt to further characterize transition. For all cases tested, our results indicate that transition occurs only when the Reynolds stresses of the flow equals or exceeds the yield stress of the fluid, i.e. the plug is broken before transition commences. Once in transition and when turbulent, the behavior of the yield stress fluid is somewhat similar to a (simpler) shear thinning fluid. We have also observed the shape of slugs during transition and find that their leading edges to be highly elongated and located off the central axis of the pipe, for the non-Newtonian fluids examined. Finally we present a new phenomenological approach for quantifying laminar-turbulent transition in pipe flow. This criterion is based on averaging a local Reynolds number to give ReG. Our localised parameter shows strong radial variations that are maximal at approximately the radial positions where puffs first appear during the first stages of turbulent transition.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental investigation of a model forming fabric</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gilchrist, Seth</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Paper making involves three fabrics: forming, pressing, and drying. The forming fabric is responsible for sheet forming, the initial dewatering of a low concentration pulp suspension into a wet sheet of paper. In the process of forming, topographical and hydrodynamic marks can be transferred from the drainage media (the forming fabric) to the sheet produced. An experimental investigation of a model forming fabric was performed to identify the geometric parameters having the largest influence on hydrodynamic wire mark. The data were also compared with the numerical simulations of Huang. To simplify the problem, justifiable engineering simplifications were made. The second phase (the fibres) was removed and the machine-direction filaments were neglected. This reduced the problem to investigation of flow through a bank of dissimilar cylinders. It was desired to find the most important geometrical parameter to reduce flow non-uniformity in the paper side flow field. Particle image velocimetry, pressure drop and flow visualization tests were conducted to investigate the flow through the array of cylinders. It was found that with a cylinder surface separation of 0.75$\times$ the paper side cylinder diameter the pressure drop tended toward the sum of the rows, and the paper side flow field was nearly identical to the paper side row only flow field, regardless of the backing side cylinder dimensions and configuration. It was seen that when the pressure drop through the bank of cylinders was equal to the sum of the rows' pressure drops the paper side flow field was the same as the paper side row only flow field. As such, pressure drop can act as an indication of when the machine side row will not affect the paper side flow field.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The AdS/CFT correspondence and string theory on the pp-wave</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ramadanovic, Bojan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence are studied in the pp.-wave/BMN limit. We use the light cone string field theory to investigate energy shifts of the one and two impurity states. In the case of two impurity states we find that logarithmic divergences, in the sums of intermediate states, actually cancel out between the Hamiltonian and a Q-dependent contact term”. We show how non-perturbative terms, that have previously plagued this theory, vanish as a consequence of this cancelation. We argue from this that every order of internal impurities contributes to the overall energy shift and attempt to give a systematic way of calculating such sums for the case of the simplest 3-string vertex (one proposed by diVecchia). We extend our analysis of the mass shift to the case of the most advanced 3-string vertex (proposed by Dobashi and Yoneya). We find agreement between our string field theory calculations and the leading order CFT result in the BMN limit. We also find strong similarities between our result and higher orders in the field theory, including, on the string side, the disappearance of the half-integer powers which generically do not exist in the field theory calculations. We also study the orbifolding of the pp-wave background which results in the discrete quantization of the light-cone momentum. We present the string field theory calculation for such a discreet momentum case. We also observe how a particular choice of the orbifold, results in the string theory corresponding to the quantization of the finite size giant magnon on the CFT side. We study this theory in detail with particular emphasis on its super algebra.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Cosmological recombination</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wong, Wan Yan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis we focus on studying the physics of cosmological recombination and how the details of recombination affect the Cosmic Microwave Back ground (CMB) anisotropies. We present a detailed calculation of the spectral line distortions on the CMB spectrum arising from the Ly α and two-photon transitions in the recombination of hydrogen (H), as well as the corresponding lines from helium (He). The peak of these distortions mainly comes from the Ly α transition and occurs at about 170 μm, which is the Wien part of the CMB. The detection of this distortion would provide the most direct supporting evidence that the Universe was indeed once a plasma. The major theoretical limitation for extracting cosmological parameters from the CMB sky lies in the precision with which we can calculate the cosmologi cal recombination process. Uncertainty in the details of hydrogen and helium recombination could effectively increase the errors or bias the values of the cos mological parameters derived from microwave anisotropy experiments. With this motivation, we perform a multi-level calculation of the recombination of H and He with the addition of the spin-forbidden transition for neutral helium (He I), plus the higher order two-photon transitions for H and among singlet states of He I. Here, we relax the thermal equilibrium assumption among the higher excited states to investigate the effect of these extra forbidden transitions on the ionization fraction Xe and the CMB angular power spectrum C. We find that the inclusion of the spin-forbidden transition results in more than a percent change in Xe, while the higher order non-resonance two-photon transitions give much smaller effects compared with previous studies. Lastly we modify the cosmological recombination code RECFAST by introduc ing one more parameter to reproduce recent numerical results for the speed-up of helium recombination. Together with the existing hydrogen ‘fudge factor’, we vary these two parameters to account for the remaining dominant uncertainties in cosmological recombination. By using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with Planck forecast data, we find that we need to determine the parameters to better than 10% for HeT and 1% for H, in order to obtain negligible effects on the cosmological parameters.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Using refractive index to monitor oil quality in high voltage transformers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kisch, Ryan John</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Insuring reliable operation of high voltage electrical equipment, such as transformers and cables, is of great importance to the power industry. This is done by monitoring the equipment. A large portion of this monitoring includes analyzing the quality of the insulating oils and observing various compounds formed in the oils during aging. Most often, transformer monitoring includes routine oil sampling and analysis, which has proven to be very effective at diagnosing faults and determining the insulation condition. Many techniques have been demonstrated for the purpose of online monitoring, and various commercial products are available. However, utility companies are still looking for more cost effective methods to monitor their equipment between sampling intervals. The work presented here was performed in order to investigate the use of refractive index for monitoring insulating oils. The refractive indices of various oil samples obtained from the field were measured and differences were observed. Accelerated aging experiments were conducted in a laboratory and increases in the refractive indices of these artificially aged oils were observed. Experiments were conducted to determine what by-products would contribute to this increased refractive index by investigating the effects of individual groups on the refractive index change. These groups included aromatic compounds, polar compounds, furans, acid, and fault gases. We observe that the formation of furans, acids, and fault gases cannot be detected using refractive index for the concentrations typically found in the field. We conclude that changes in the refractive index of an oil can be used as an indicator of the oil’s aging and its break down and the formation of aromatic and polar compounds.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>GaAs₁₋xBix light emitting diodes : a new long wavelength semiconductor light source</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lewis, Ryan B.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>GaAs₁₋xBix is an exciting new semiconductor material, which has been pro posed as a new material for infrared light emitting devices. Recent ad vancements in the growth of GaAs₁₋xBix films have made it possible to produce GaAs₁₋xBix light emitting diodes for the first time. Throughout this research we have grown, fabricated and characterized GaAs₁₋xBix light emitting diodes. Similarly structured InxGa₁₋xAs light emitting diodes were also produced and characterized for comparison to the GaAs₁₋xBix devices. Strong electroluminescence was obtained from GaAs₁₋xBix devices, showing two emission peaks, one corresponding to the GaAs₁₋xBix layer and the other to the GaAs cladding. Emission from InxGa₁₋x_As devices was about 100 times brighter than from GaAs₁₋xBix devices. Temperature dependent electroluminescence and photoluminescence measurements of a GaAs₁₋xBix light emitting diode were made and showed some unusual results. The wavelength of the peak in the electroluminescence from the GaAs₁₋xBix was independent of temperature in the range 100 K to 300 K while the GaAs peak shifted with temperature as expected. Photoluminescence measurements on the same structure show temperature dependence of the peak wavelength similar to the temperature dependence of GaAs.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Improving attenuation corrections obtained using singles-mode transmission data in small-animal PET</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Vandervoort, Eric</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The images in positron emission tomography (PET) represent three dimensional dynamic distributions of biologically interesting molecules labelled with positron emitting radionuclides (radiotracers). Spatial localisation of the radio-tracers is achieved by detecting in coincidence two collinear photons which are emitted when the positron annihilates with an ordinary electron. In order to obtain quantitatively accurate images in PET, it is necessary to correct for the effects of photon attenuation within the subject being imaged. These corrections can be obtained using singles-mode photon transmission scanning. Although suitable for small animal PET, these scans are subject to high amounts of contamination from scattered photons. Currently, no accurate correction exists to account for scatter in these data. The primary purpose of this work was to implement and validate an analytical scatter correction for PET transmission scanning. In order to isolate the effects of scatter, we developed a simulation tool which was validated using experimental transmission data. We then presented an analytical scatter correction for singles-mode transmission data in PET. We compared our scatter correction data with the previously validated simulation data for uniform and non-uniform phantoms and for two different transmission source radionuclides. Our scatter calculation correctly predicted the contribution from scattered photons to the simulated data for all phantoms and both transmission sources. We then applied our scatter correction as part of an iterative reconstruction algorithm for simulated and experimental PET transmission data for uniform and non-uniform phantoms. We also tested our reconstruction and scatter correction procedure using transmission data for several animal studies (mice, rats and primates). For all studies considered, we found that the average reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients for water or soft-tissue regions of interest agreed with expected values to within 4%. Using a 2.2 GHz processor, the scatter correction required between 6 to 27 minutes of CPU time (without any code optimisation) depending on the phantom size and source used. This extra calculation time does not seem unreasonable considering that, without scatter corrections, errors in the reconstructed attenuation coefficients were between 18 to 45% depending on the phantom size and transmission source used.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Limitations on tidal-in-stream power generation in a strait</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Atwater, Joel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the quest to reduce the release of carbon dioxide to limit the effects of global climate change, tidal-in-stream energy is being investigated as one of many possible sustainable means of generating electricity. In this scheme, turbines are placed in a tidal flow and kinetic energy is extracted. With the goal of producing maximum power, there is an ideal amount of resistance these turbines should provide; too little resistance will not a develop a sufficient pressure differential, while too much resistance will choke the flow. Tidal flow in a strait is driven by the difference in sea-level along the channel and is impeded by friction; the interplay between the driving and resistive forces determines the flow rate and thus the extractible power. The use of kinetic energy flux, previously employed as a metric for extractible power, is found to be unreliable as it does not account for the increased resistance the turbines provide in retarding the flow. The limits on extraction from a channel are dependant on the relationship between head loss and velocity. If head loss increases with the square of the velocity, a maximum of 38% of the total fluid power may be extracted; this maximum decreases to 25\% if head loss increases linearly with velocity. Using these values, the estimated power potential of BC's Inside Passage is 477MW, 13% of previous assessments. If a flow has the ability to divert through a parallel channel around the installed turbines, there are further limits on production. The magnitude of this diversion is a function of the relative resistance of impeded and diversion channels. As power extraction increases, the flow will slow from its natural rate. This reduction in velocity precipitously decreases the power density the flow, requiring additional turbine area per unit of power. As such, the infrastructure costs per watt may rise five to eight times as additional turbines are installed. This places significant economic limitations on utility-scale tidal energy production.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Gravitational waves from a string cusp in Einstein-aether theory</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lalancette, Marc</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The motivation of this thesis is to look for a signature of Lorentz violation, hopefully observable, in the gravitational waves emitted by cosmic strings. Aspects of cosmic strings are reviewed, in particular how focused bursts of gravitational radiation are emitted when a cusp forms on the string. The same phenomenon is then studied in an effective field theory with Lorentz violation called Einstein-aether theory. This is a simple theory with a dynamic preferred frame, but it retains rotational and diffeomorphism invariance. The linearized version of the theory produces five wave modes. We study the usual transverse traceless modes which now have a wave speed that can be lower or greater than the speed of light. This altered speed produces distinctive features in the waves. They depend on two free parameters: roughly the wave speed and the acceleration of the string cusp. The profile of the wave is analyzed in detail for different values of the parameters and explained by close comparison with the string motion.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electron emission from carbon nanotubes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yaghoobi, Parham</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, I will provide an overview of the subject from various experimental and theoretical angles with an emphasis on the limited number of theoretical works that exist in calculating the emission current. I will then present a first-principles calculation of the emission current in a single-walled carbon nanotube using the non-equilibrium Green's function and Fisher-Lee's transmission formulation to describe electronic transport through the system. The simulation results reproduce the trends observed in experimental data closely and, in particular, the current saturation behavior observed in experiments and the deviation from the Fowler-Nordheim behavior. The proposed numerical approach is useful whenever a region of vacuum is present in the device Hamiltonian, which existing commercial transport solvers do not model. To better characterize nanotube electron sources, I have also done some preliminary experimental work, which has involved building equipments and developing recipes for growing carbon nanotubes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Heat transfer near the transition to turbulent fluidization</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Stefanova, Ana</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The turbulent fluidization flow regime, a transitional flow regime situated between bubbling and fast fluidization, has received relatively little attention in the heat transfer literature, despite its advantages for operating commercial gas-solid fluidized bed reactors. This work investigates simultaneously bed–to–surface heat transfer coefficients and changes in the local hydrodynamics near the transition from bubbling to turbulent fluidization flow regimes. Experiments were conducted with fluid cracking catalyst (FCC) and alumina particles in columns of different diameters, a 0.29 m ID column at UBC in Vancouver, Canada, and a 1.56 m ID column at CSIRO Minerals in Clayton, Australia. Radial and axial locations of the heat transfer surface, static bed height and superficial gas velocity were varied. Two distributor configurations were examined in the smaller column: perforated plate and bubble cap. The transition to turbulent fluidization was determined based on changes in trends and features of pressure and optical probes signals. To measure the bed-to-immersed surface heat transfer coefficients, a modular electrically heated vertical tube was designed. The results showed maximum heat transfer coefficients near the onset of turbulent fluidization and increased uniformity of the radial and axial distributions of heat transfer coefficients when the turbulent fluidization regime became dominant. It was discovered that the transition to turbulent fluidization was more complex and occurred gradually across the bed in the larger column. However, the maximum heat transfer coefficient was not affected by the column size. The Froude number, based on the column diameter, provided a good scaling parameter in regions of similar flow structure. A novel transparent heat transfer probe was designed for transient local heat transfer measurement at the column wall and simultaneous evaluation of the hydrodynamics at the heat transfer surface. This study provided insight into the changing dominant mechanism of heat transfer at the onset of turbulent fluidization. A probabilistic heat transfer model was developed, based on the packet renewal theory and the probability of having particle packets corresponding to each hydrodynamic regime at the heat transfer surface. The novelty of the model is the contribution of packets of intermediate voidage, typical for turbulent fluidized beds, to the total heat transfer coefficient.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Tsui, Tyron</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents results from the through-going muon analysis at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. Over 1229.26 days, 77376 direct cosmic ray muons above cosθ &gt; 0.4 and 514 neutrino-induced muons in the range -1 &lt; cosθ &lt; 0.4 were detected. A log-likelihood analysis was performed on the neutrino-induced muons to produce a flux measurement and constrain atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters. The best-fit oscillation values were Δm² = (2.6±2.0) × 10⁻³ eV², sin²2θ = 1.0±0.1. The observed muon flux was found to be (2.48±0.25) × 10⁻¹³ cm⁻²s⁻¹sr⁻¹ resulting in an overall flux normalization 1.22±0.09 times the theoretical estimates from the Bartol group. The quoted uncertainties are 1-D marginalized. The no-oscillation hypothesis was ruled out at 99.8% confidence level. The observed number of direct cosmic ray muons was converted into a vertical depth intensity. The resulting fits to the intensity as a function of depth were I₀ = (0.93±0.05) × 10⁻⁶ cm⁻²s⁻¹sr⁻¹, x = 2.33±0.31 km.w.e. and α = 5.62±0.40.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Estimation of grout distribution in a fractured rock by numerical modeling</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rahmani, Helia</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Grouting has been used over the past two centuries to increase the strength, decrease the deformation and reduce the permeability of soils or fractured rocks. Due to its significance in engineering and science predicting grout effectiveness in fractured rocks is of interest. There are different approaches to estimate the effectiveness of grouting, one of which is numerical modeling. Numerical models can simulate distribution of grout inside fractures by which the effectiveness of grout can be estimated. Few numerical studies have been carried out to model grout penetration in fractured rocks. Due to complexities of modeling grout and fracture most of these studies have either used simplifying assumptions or been bound to small sizes of fractures, both resulting in unrealistic simulations. The current work aims to eliminates some of the simplifying assumptions and develop a model that can improve the reliability of the results. In reality grouts are believed to behave as a Bingham fluid, but many models do not consider a full Bingham fluid flow solution due to its complexity. Also, real fractures have rough surfaces with randomly varying apertures. However, some models consider fractures as planes with two parallel sides and a constant aperture. In the current work the Bingham fluid flow equation are solved numerically over a stochastically varying aperture fracture. To simplify the equations and decrease the computational time the current model substitutes two-dimensional elements by one-dimensional pipes with equivalent properties. The model is capable of simulating the time penetration of grout in a mesh of fracture over a rather long period of time. The results of the model can be used to predict the grout penetration for different conditions of fractures or grout.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>New constraints on Mercury's internal magnetic field</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Uno, Hideharu</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Three-component vector magnetic field observations from MESSENGER’s first two flybys of Mercury have confirmed the presence of an internal field, along with external fields related to magnetospheric current systems. We use techniques in inverse theory to investigate structure in Mercury’s inter nal magnetic field permitted by the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER flyby data, and structures recoverable while spacecraft is in orbit. We remove external fields predicted by a parameterized magnetospheric model from the flyby observations. We estimate noise contributions from long-wavelength uncertainties in the external field and from un-modeled short-wavelength features. Internal field models are parameterized to spherical harmonic degree and order 8, with regularization constraints applied to the power spectrum. The field is predominantly dipolar but additional latitudinal and longitudinal structure is required to fit the data. Enhanced radial magnetic field in the region of the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER flybys latitudes is seen. Contributions to the internal field predicted by Aharonson and others for a long-wavelength crustal field are present (namely, the g⁰₁, g⁰₃, and g²₃ spherical harmonic coefficients), but our hypothesis testing has shown that the field is dominated by the g⁰₁ term rather than the proposed g⁰₃ term. Further hypothesis testing has determined that the dipole tilt of Mercury is in the range of 30 to 13° with 13° as a strict upper bound. Observations from the upcoming MESSENGER flyby will provide additional, and critical, low-latitude coverage. Analyses of flyby data have shown that much of the recovery internal field depends successfully characterizing the external field signatures that are present in the data. Currently, the limited ninnber of ob servations prevents us from constructing a reliable external field model, but these external field models will improve as data becomes more abundant. We also investigate recovery of three simulated core fields using synthetic data during MESSENGER’s orbital phase, under the assumption that long wavelength external fields can be modeled and removed. The results show excellent recovery of the dipole field and of field structure at mid-northern to high latitudes out to degree and order 10, providing encouraging results for future identification and characterization of core fields.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Aspects of SU(2|4) symmetric field theories and the Lin-Maldacena geometries</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>van Anders, Greg</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Gauge/gravity duality is an important tool for learning about strongly coupled gauge theories. This thesis explores a set of examples of this duality in which the field theories have SU(2|4) supersymmetry and discrete sets of vacuum solutions. Specifically, we use the duality to propose Lagrangian definitions of type IIA Little String Theory on S⁵ as double-scaling limits of the Plane-Wave Matrix Model, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R x S² and N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R×S³/Zk. We find the supergravity solutions dual to generic vacua of the Plane-Wave Matrix Model and maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R×S². We use the supergravity duals to calculate new instanton amplitudes for the Plane-Wave Matrix Model at strong coupling. Finally, we study a natural coarse-graining of the vacua, and find that the associated geometries are singular. We define an entropy functional that vanishes for regular geometries, is non-zero for singular geometries, and is maximized by the thermal state.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dynamical correlations of S=1/2 quantum spin chains</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pereira, Rodrigo Gonçalves</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Spin-1/2 chains demonstrate some of the striking effects of interactions and quantum fluctuations in one-dimensional systems. The XXZ model has been used to study the unusual properties of anisotropic spin chains in an external magnetic field. The zero temperature phase diagram for this model exhibits a critical or quasi-long-range-ordered phase which is a realization of a Luttinger liquid. While many static properties of spin-1/2 chains have been explained by combinations of analytical techniques such as bosonization and Bethe ansatz, the standard approach fails in the calculation of some time-dependent correlation functions. I present a study of the longitudinal dynamical structure factor for the XXZ model in the critical regime. I show that an approximation for the line shape of the dynamical structure factor in the limit of small momentum transfer can be obtained by going beyond the Luttinger model and treating irrelevant operators associated with band curvature effects. This approach is able to describe the width of the on-shell peak and the high-frequency tail at finite magnetic field. Integrability is shown to affect the low-energy effective model at zero field, with consequences for the line shape. The power-law singularities at the thresholds of the particle-hole continuum are investigated using an analogy with the X-ray edge problem. Using methods of Bethe ansatz and conformal field theory, I compute the exact exponents for the edge singularities of the dynamical structure factor. The same methods are used to study the long-time asymptotic behavior of the spin self-correlation function, which is shown to be dominated by a high-energy excitation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Facet-dependent electronic properties of silicon nanowires</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Xu, Xiaodan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The effects of surface reconstruction and progressive hydroxylation on the electronic properties of [110] hexagonal silicon nanowires are investigated by ab initio calculations within the density functional theory. Progressive hydroxylation changes the density of states close to valence band maxima and leads to a general decrease in the band gap. The magnitude of band gap reduction is dependent on the facet where the hydroxyl group is bonded. While a high reduction in band gap (10%) is observed for hydroxylation on (111) facets, for (001) facets the reduction is more pronounced (21%) only when there is a (3 x 1) reconstruction. The reduction in band gap is generally accompanied by an o_-center radial shift in the location of the charge density arising from the HOMO. These results go to show the impact of surface reconstruction and termination groups on the electronic properties of Si nanowires, which are important for using these materials for biosensor and transistor applications. In order to synthesize Si nanowires, this thesis also explores the self-organization of citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles onto amino-terminated surfaces. The deposition of citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles onto hydrogen-terminated Si surface with pH modification is also investigated and is compared with the self-organized method. Both approaches show gold colloid deposition.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Localized patterns in the Gray-Scott model : an asymptotic and numerical study of dynamics and stability</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chen, Wan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Localized patterns have been observed in many reaction-diffusion systems. One well-known such system is the two-component Gray-Scott model, which has been shown numerically to exhibit a rich variety of localized spatio-temporal patterns including, standing spots, oscillating spots, self-replicating spots, etc. This thesis concentrates on analyzing the localized pattern formation in this model that occurs in the semi-strong interaction regime where the diffusivity ratio of the two solution components is asymptotically small. In a one-dimensional spatial domain, two distinct types of oscillatory instabilities of multi-spike solutions to the Gray-Scott model that occur in different parameter regimes are analyzed. These two instabilities relate to either an oscillatory instability in the amplitudes of the spikes, or an oscillatory instability in the spatial locations of the spikes. In the latter case a novel Stefan-type problem, with moving Dirac source terms, is shown to characterize the dynamics of a collection of spikes. From a numerical and analytical study of this problem, it is shown that an oscillatory motion in the spike locations can be initiated through a Hopf bifurcation. In a subregime of the parameters it is shown that this Stefan-type problem is quasi-steady, allowing for the derivation of an explicit set of ODE's for the spike dynamics. In this subregime, a nonlocal eigenvalue problem analysis shows that spike amplitude oscillations can occur from another Hopf bifurcation. In a two-dimensional domain, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to construct multi-spot solutions by effectively summing an infinite-order logarithmic expansion in terms of a small parameter. An asymptotic differential algebraic system of ODE's for the spot locations is derived to characterize the slow dynamics of a collection of spots. Furthermore, it is shown theoretically and from the numerical computation of certain eigenvalue problems that there are three main types of fast instabilities for a multi-spot solution. These instabilities are spot self-replication, spot annihilation due to overcrowding, and an oscillatory instability in the spot amplitudes. These instability mechanisms are studied in detail and phase diagrams in parameter space where they occur are computed and illustrated for various spatial configurations of spots and several domain geometries.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An experimental study of two multi-fluid flows of interest to the oilfield cementing industry</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Malekmohammadi, Sardar</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this work two multi-fluid flows are studied. In the first project, displacement flows in an eccentric annulus were studied experimentally. Displacement flows occur in the oil and gas industry during well construction when drilling mud is displaced by a cement slurry. To remove mud effectively, it is important to design the fluid rheology so that a steady displacement front can be achieved when displacing along an eccentric annulus. In our research, we have investigated the effects of viscosity, density and eccentricity of inner pipe on the interface dynamics. An experimental matrix is devised in a manner to capture the boundary between steady and unsteady displacements for specific pairs of fluids, and to compare against previously published models. Reasonable qualitative agreement was achieved however a systematic discrepancy was observed due to the presence of secondary flows and dispersion in the experiments. These effects have not been studied carefully so far and more sophisticated models are needed to predict this type of flow. In the second project, slumping flows of two non-Newtonian fluids in horizontal closed pipes were studied. This type of flow occurs during the abandonment of horizontal oil and gas wells, when sealing the well through the setting of cement plugs. We have studied the effects of changes in density difference and of small deviations from a perfectly horizontal inclination. The effects of these parameters on the slump length versus time were analyzed. Comparison of numerical and experimental results shows broadly similar trends, but with some qualitative differences also observed, possibly due to interfacial effects</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Unstable waves on a sheared density interface</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Carpenter, Jeffrey Richard</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The Holmboe instability is known to occur in stratified shear layers that exhibit a relatively thin density interface compared to the shear layer thickness. At finite amplitude the instability appears as cusp-like propagating internal waves. The evolution and identification of these unstable waves is the subject of this thesis. The results are presented in four parts. First, the basic wave field resulting from Holmboe's instability is studied both numerically and experimentally. In comparing basic descriptors of the wave fields, a number of processes are identified that are responsible for differences between the simulations and experiments. These are related to variations in the mean flow that arise due to the different boundary conditions. Holmboe waves are known to produce vertical ejections of interfacial fluid from the wave crests. This `ejection process,' in which stratified fluid is transported against buoyancy forces, is caused by the formation of a vortex couple (i.e. two vorticies of opposite sign that travel as a pair). Results obtained by means of direct numerical simulations also show that the process is primarily two-dimensional and does not require the presence of both upper and lower Holmboe modes. Shear instability is then studied in the highly stratified Fraser River estuary. The observations are found to be in good agreement with the predictions of linear theory. When instability occurs, it is largely as a result of asymmetry between regions of strong shear and density stratification. The structure of the salinity intrusion is found to depend on the strength of the freshwater discharge, in addition to the phase of the tidal cycle. This has implications for whether estuarine mixing takes place through shear instability or boundary layer turbulence. Finally, the asymmetric stratified shear layer, which exhibits a vertical shift between the density interface and the shear layer centre, is examined by the formulation of a diagnostic that is based on the `wave interaction' mechanism of instability growth. This allows for a quantitative assessment of Kelvin-Helmhotz and Holmboe-type growth mechanisms in stratified shear layers. The predictions of the diagnostic are compared to results of nonlinear simulations and observations in the Fraser River estuary.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Low temperature spintronics : probing charge and spin states with two-dimensional electron gas</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yu, Wing Wa</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis is based on two low temperature experiments in spintronics - physics and engineering of electronic spins. The measurements were performed on a GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron gas with geometries defined by tunable surface gates. The first experiment is about detection of electrons in a quantum dot. A quantum point contact (QPC) and a quantum wire (QW) is coupled to a single-lead few-electron quantum dot. By measuring the conductance of the QPC and the QW, one can gain information on the average number of electrons in the dot as well as energy-level structure of the dot. The second experiment investigates anisotropy of spin-orbit interaction in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure by measuring spin polarization in a narrow channel. Polarized electrons are injected into the channel through a spin-selective injector QPC and diffuse towards the end of the channel. This diffusion generates a pure spin current and the spin polarization 25 microns away is measured by a detector QPC. A periodic spin-orbit field induced by motion of the electrons in the channel causes the spins to resonate with external magnetic field. Spin-orbit anisotropy is demonstrated by the different resonance strength observed in channels aligned along two different crystal axes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Pneumatic switching of the optical power of a Fresnel lens for control of solar illumination</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Watanabe, Eri</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A pneumatic-based illumination switch has been developed for use in conjunction with collimated daylighting collection systems that collect sunlight on the façade of a multi-storey building and distribute it throughout the core areas of the building. Daylight collection systems are currently of interest since they have the potential to significantly reduce the need for electrical lighting in workplaces, thus reducing the required electrical energy and associated greenhouse gas emissions. In one particular system, sunlight is distributed by hollow light guides and redirected into light fixtures positioned along the guides. The illumination switch described here can be incorporated into the light guides to control the amount of sunlight that is directed into each fixture. This control device consisted of a Fresnel lens positioned with its structured surface adjacent to a layer of silicone gel that had a similar refractive index value as the lens. In one mode of operation, the gel layer was separated from the lens so that the lens focused incident sunlight into a hollow light guide that carried the sunlight to a fixture. In the second mode of operation, when the index-matching gel layer was pressed into contact with the structured surface of the Fresnel lens, the switch allowed sunlight to pass substantially undeflected through the lens and continued down the guide. The switch was activated by a vacuum pump that adjusted the relative pressure in order to pull the silicone gel into and out of contact with the Fresnel lens. Experimental tests showed that intensity of the light emitted by a fixture can be controllably and reproducibly reduced by about 75 % of the original intensity when the switch was activated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Holographic effective theories for strongly coupled physics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Shieh , Hsien-Hang</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis we summarize three of our work using the gauge/gravity dualities to build effective theories for strongly coupled phenomena. First, we study the thermodynamics of large N pure 2+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory on a small spatial S². By studying the effective action for the Polyakov loop order parameter, we show analytically that the theory has a second order deconfinement transition. Our results together with extrapolation of lattice QCD results imply a critical radius in the phase diagram where the deconfinement transition switches from second order to first order. We show that the point at the critical radius and temperature can be either a tricritical point with universal behavior or a triple point separating three distinct phases. Second, we study a model of holographic QCD at zero temperature and finite chemical potential. We find that as the baryon chemical potential is increased, the system transitions to a nuclear matter phase characterized by a condensate of instantons on the probe D-branes in the string theory dual. The electrostatic interactions between the instantons cause the condensate to expand towards the UV with increasing chemical potential, giving a holographic version of the expansion of the Fermi surface. We also find possible explanation of the ``chiral density wave'' instability in large N QCD. We argue that the model can be used to make semi-quantitative predictions of the binding energy per nucleon for nuclear matter in QCD. Third, we consider an Abelian Higgs model placed in an AdS black hole background. Such model has been shown to exhibit superconductor like transitions. In the superconducting phase the system shows infinite DC conductivity. This suggests the possibility of turning on a time independent supercurrent. In this paper we study such supercurrent solutions and the associated phase diagram. We find a critical point in the phase diagram where the second order superconducting transition becomes first order. Supercurrent solutions are well studied in condensed matter systems. We find some qualitative agreement with known results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Sub-micron pitch variable diffraction grating using nanoporous electrodes and electrophoresis of dye ions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wong, Richard Tik Fai</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>One approach to achieve non-mechanical beam steering is to use variable diffraction devices, whose intensity and direction of the outgoing diffractive orders can be actively (typically electronically) altered by modifying the optical properties of the device. Devices with sub-micron features are of particular interest when working with visible wavelengths, since such gratings can, when not activated, produce only an undeflected beam as the output and, when activated, produce diffractive orders at large deflection angles that appear and disappear entirely. Such sub-micron pitch variable diffraction gratings can be achieved by electrophoretically moving dye ions into and out of appropriately patterned transparent electrically-conductive nanoporous electrodes. This study aimed to explore their potential for use in practical devices. One significant technical hurdle associated with these devices has been the irreversible electrochemical reactions that can be induced with an applied voltage difference between the two electrodes exceeding a critical value on the order of 1 V. These reactions are undesirable as they limit the lifetime of the device. However, it was observed that when operating within such a voltage limit the optical response time is undesirably long - on the order of seconds. To better optimize the lifetime and response time of these devices, an electron tunneling model of the electrochemical reaction threshold was developed and verified. This enabled the use of a high speed drive circuit that was able to improve the response time by a factor of 50 without compromising the lifetime of the device. A prototype grating with nanoporous zinc antimonate electrodes and methylene blue dye-methanol solution was fabricated using focused ion beam milling. Modulation of a diffractive order was observed with this prototype, where the exit beam geometry was in good agreement with the model. The diffractive efficiency of the diffractive order was observed to be 3.9×10-3 when in the charged state and 7.9×10-4 when in the uncharged state with an optical switching time of 250 ms. These observations demonstrated the potential of this type of device to achieve large angular deflection and fast operating speed for non-mechanical beam steering applications.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Turbulent flow in geophysical channels</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>DeGiuli, Eric</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The problem of turbulent ow in a rough pipe of arbitrary shape is considered. The classical Izakson-Millikan argument for a logarithmic velocity profile is presented, and matched asymptotic expansions are introduced. Scaled, dimensionless equations are produced and simplified. A simple mixing length turbulence model is presented, which closes the problem. To calibrate the model, the mechanical problem is solved in the case of a circular pipe. Excellent agreement with engineering relations is obtained. The mechanical problem for a non-circular pipe is posed, and the boundary layer problem is solved. This leaves unknown the wall stress, which is sought through approximate methods of solution in the outer region. These are presented and the approximate solutions thus obtained are compared to full numerical solutions and data for a square, elliptical, and semi-elliptical pipe. The approximations are vindicated, but agreement between the numerical solutions and data is only moderate. Discrepancies are explained in terms of the neglected secondary ow. The thermal problem is posed, with scalings taken for intended application in glaciology. The problem is solved for a circular pipe. Heat transfer results are presented and compared with empirical relations. The general problem for a non-circular pipe is posed, and approximate methods of solution are motivated, in analogy to those used for the mechanical problem. These are used to obtain approximate solutions, which are compared with numerical solutions, to good agreement. Possible applications of these solutions are discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Linear transmission and reflection spectroscopic studies of colloidal PbS(x) nanocrystal films : paving the way for nonlinear optics in such films</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ning, Hailong</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis investigates the feasibility of conducting nonlinear degenerate four-wave-mixing experiments on colloidal PbS or PbSe semiconductor nanocrystal films. It concludes that such experiment cannot be effectively carried out in the conventional forward geometry due to large scattering from the emulsive nanocrystal films, while it may be possible in the backward geometry. These conclusions were reached by studying the linear transmission and reflection spectra from a variety of PbS and PbSe NC films on both silicon and glass substrates. These studies suggest that the electronic structure of the PbS and PbSe NCs in close-packed films are well-maintained while the scattering inside these NC films is Rayleigh-like and quite strong. Theoretical fitting of these spectra reveals the refractive indicies and absorption rates of these films, which match those recently reported in the literature. It also suggests the presence of a distinct interfacial layer with a low concentration of nanocrystals between silicon and the dense NC emulsion, which was also confirmed by optical microscopy. This layer, on the order of 100 nm thick, has important consequences for optical studies of these films.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electrical measurement of spin-dependent resistivity in GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron gas</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ebrahimnejad Rahbari, Seyed Hadi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The electrical transport in the semiconductor two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in the presence of magnetic fields have been the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical studies. Whereas the experiments generally focus on the total magnetotransport of the spin-up and spin-down electrons, the problem of how individual spin components contribute to the sum has been mostly remained untouched. Due to the Zeeman splitting of the Fermi velocities, spin-up and spin-down electrons face different resistivities against their flow. In this thesis, this problem is addressed based on electrical generation and detection of nonequilibrium spin polarization in a narrow conducting channel of 2DEG in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. It makes use of narrow quasi-one-dimensional constrictions, known as quantum point contacts (QPCs), at a high magnetic field as the injector and detector of the spin polarization. We also simulate the problem based on an one-dimensional spin diffusion model and it turns out that it numerically agrees with the measurements using an electron spin susceptibility which is enhanced compared to that of bare GaAs. Such enhancements are generally linked with the electron-electron interactions which become important for electrons in confined geometries. The first section reviews the general characteristic properties of 2DEGs in GaAs/AlGaAs semiconductor heterostructures, gate-defined structures and quantized electrical transport through QPCs. The second chapter reviews the main results of electronic transport measurements on 2DEGs in the presence of in-plane magnetic fields, and the third chapter includes our spin polarization measurement results in a narrow channel of 2DEG and how they help to account for the effect of spin orientation on the electrical resistivity.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The metal-insulator transition in Mn-substituted Sr₃Ru₂O₇ by a photoemission study</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhu, Zhi Huai</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We have studied the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in Mn-substituted Sr₃Ru₂O₇ by x-ray photoemission (XPS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In XPS, both the surface- and bulk-sensitive spectra show a two-peak structure, corresponding to the well screened and the unscreened excitations. The evolution of the well screened peak with Mn is that the higher the concentration of Mn impurities, the lower the intensity of the peak, indicating that the screening channels are determined by the metallic property of a system. In ARPES, a strong doping dependence is also observed for the Fermi surface, which loses the 2D sheet associated with the dxy band and reduces to the 1D dxz/yz Fermi surfaces, as the system changes from metal to a Mott insulator. As for the band dispersion, we see that the dxy band shifts in energy toward the chemical potential, becoming degenerate with the dxz/yz bands, to the point of being indistinguishable. A nesting vector (0.33, 0.33, 0) has been determined from the Fermi surface of the 10% Mn doped sample, as in response to-or alternatively inducing-a charge/orbital ordering across the Mott transition. The opening of an energy gap is observed below the MIT both as a function of temperature and Mn substitution. To obtain a microscopic understanding of the MIT, we have performed a local-density approximation calculations for the electronic structures of Sr₃Ru₂O₇ and found that spin-orbital coupling induces an unexpected magnetic anisotropy. This might play a key role in the emergence of the MIT and magnetic superstructure in Mn-substituted Sr₃Ru₂O₇, as well as the nematic behavior in the parent compound.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hydrodynamic controls on the movement of invertebrate larvae and organic matter in small streams</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hoover, Trent</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The movement of organisms and resources within ecosystems are essential elements in the productivity, stability, and distribution of communities. This thesis examines how water velocity, a defining factor of lotic systems, influences the dispersion of benthic organisms and particulate organic matter in small stream ecosystems. Variation in movement-related behaviours in two rheophilous (‘flow-loving’) mayflies (Epeorus and Baetis) and two rheophobic (‘flow-avoiding’) mayflies (Ameletus and Paraleptophlebia) were compared to determine how benthic organisms disperse between and within habitat patches in hydrodynamically complex landscapes. The degree to which water velocity and particle shape influence the retention of organic matter (including deciduous leaves, conifer needles, red-cedar fronds, and branch fragments) was examined to determine how physical factors determine detrital resource availability in streams. Although water velocity did not influence the crawling rates of Baetis and Ameletus in daylight conditions, both mayflies dispersed rapidly upstream in low-velocity flows in dark conditions. Drift rates of both mayflies were lower in daylight than dark conditions, and were generally inversely related to their habitat preferences. Escape responses in grazing Epeorus, Baetis, and Ameletus larvae in a range of flow conditions showed that retreat distance was more sensitive than flight initiation distance to variation in water velocity, suggesting that hydrodynamics mediate the risks of predation and the costs of flight in stream systems. Comparisons of the transport distances of live larvae, dead larvae, and passive tracer particles in low and high water velocities showed that drift distance varied substantially among taxa, and that behavioural control over drift distance generally declined as water velocity increased. While organic matter particles generally travelled further in high-velocity reaches, leaves were retained in riffles when they impacted on protruding clasts, while ‘stiff’ particles were retained when they settled into streambed interstices. Leaves placed in high-velocity microhabitats were broken down more slowly than leaves in low-flow areas, likely due to the exclusion of large-bodied detritivores. In conclusion, this thesis supports the view that hydrodynamic forces control trophic interactions and local population dynamics in stream ecosystems by directly altering the physical – and sometimes behavioural – processes of particle entrainment, transport, and deposition.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Laboratory, field and numerical investigations of Holmboe's instability</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tedford, Edmund W.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The instabilities that occur at a sheared density interface are investigated in the laboratory, the Fraser River estuary and with Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). In the laboratory, symmetric Holmboe instabilities are observed during steady, maximal two-layer exchange flow in a long channel of rectangular cross section. Internal hydraulic controls at each end of the channel isolate the subcritical region within the channel from disturbances in the reservoirs. Inside the channel, the instabilities form cusp-like waves that propagate in both directions. The phase speed of the instabilities is consistent with linear theory, and increases along the length of the channel as a result of the gradual acceleration of each layer. This acceleration causes the wavelength of any given instability to increase in the direction of flow. As the instabilities are elongated new instabilities form, and as a consequence, the average wavelength is almost constant along the length of the channel. In the Fraser River estuary, a detailed stability analysis is conducted based on the Taylor-Goldstein (TG) equation, and compared to direct observations in the estuary. We find that each set of instabilities observed coincides with an unstable mode predicted by the TG equation. Each of these instabilities occurs in a region where the gradient Richardson number is less than the critical value of 1/4. Both the TG predictions and echosoundings indicate the instabilities are concentrated either above or below the density interface. These ‘one-sided’ instabilities are closer in structure to the Holmboe instability than to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Although the dominant source of mixing in the estuary appears to be caused by shear instability, there is also evidence of small-scale overturning due to boundary layer turbulence when the tide produces strong near-bed velocities. Many features of the numerical simulations are consistent with linear theory and the laboratory experiments. However, inherent differences be tween the DNS and the experiments are responsible for variations in the dominant wavenumber and amplitude of the wave field. The simulations exhibit a nonlinear ‘wave coarsening’ effect, whereby the energy is shifted to lower wavenumber in discrete jumps. This process is, in part, related to the occurrence of ejections of mixed fluid away from the density interface. In the case of the laboratory experiment, energy is transferred to lower wavenumber by the ‘stretching’ of the wave field by a gradually varying mean velocity. This stretching of the waves results in a reduction in amplitude compared to the DNS. The results of the comparison show the dependence of the nonlinear evolution of a Holmboe wave field on temporal and spatial variations of the mean flow.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Swimming in slime</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pachmann, Sydney</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The purpose of this thesis is to study the problem of a low Reynolds number swimmer that is in very close proximity to a wall or solid boundary in a non- Newtonian fluid. We assume that it moves by propagating waves down its length in one direction, creating a thrust and therefore propelling it in the opposite direction. We model the swimmer as an infinite, inextensible waving sheet. We consider two main cases of this swimming sheet problem. In the first case, the type of wave being propagated down the length of the swimmer is specified. We compare the swimming speeds of viscoelastic shear thinning, shear thickening and Newtonian fluids for a fixed propagating wave speed. We then compare the swimming speeds of these same fluids for a fixed rate of work per wavelength. In the latter situation, we find that a shear thinning fluid always yields the fastest swimming speed regardless of the amplitude of the propagating waves. We conclude that a shear thinning fluid is optimal for the swimmer. Analytical results are obtained for various limiting cases. Next, we consider the problem with a Bingham fluid. Yield surfaces and flow profiles are obtained. In the second case, the forcing along the length of the swimmer is specified, but the shape of the swimmer is unknown. First, we solve this problem for a Newtonian fluid. Large amplitude forcing yields a swimmer shape that has a plateau region following by a large spike region. It is found that there exists an optimal forcing that will yield a maximum swimming speed. Next, we solve the problem for moderate forcing amplitudes for viscoelastic shear thickening and shear thinning fluids. For a given forcing, it is found that a shear thinning fluid yields the fastest swimming speed when compared to a shear thickening fluid and a Newtonian fluid. The difference in swimming speeds decreases as the bending stiffness of the swimmer increases.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>New mechanisms for external field control of microscopic interactions in ultracold gases</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Li, Zhiying</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This Thesis describes new mechanisms for controlling elastic and inelastic collisions of ultracold atoms and molecules with static electromagnetic and laser fields. The dynamical properties of ultracold atoms are usually tuned in experiments by applying an external magnetic field to induce a Feshbach resonance. The work presented in this Thesis demonstrates the possibility of inducing and manipulating Feshbach resonances with electric fields. We discuss in detail the mechanisms of electric-field-induced resonances in ultracold mixtures of alkali metal atoms and demonstrate that electric fields may shift and split the magnetic resonances. We show that electric fields may spin up the collision complex of ultracold atoms and induce anisotropic scattering which may be exploited in experiments on many-body dynamics of ultracold gaseous mixtures. The mechanisms of electric-field-induced resonances described in this Thesis allow for two-dimensional control of inter-particle interactions, leading to total control over ultracold gases. To guide future experiments, we generate accurate interaction potentials for ultracold Li--Rb mixtures by fitting positions and widths of experimentally measured Feshbach resonances. Ultracold atomic and molecular gases can be confined by laser fields in one or two dimensions which produces an optical lattice of ultracold particles. We develop a multichannel scattering theory for collisions of atoms and molecules in two dimensions and explore the effects of the confining laser potential on inelastic and reactive collisions of ultracold atoms and molecules in a 1D optical lattice. We show that ultracold collisions can be controlled in a quasi-2D geometry by varying the orientation of a magnetic field with respect to the confinement plane normal and demonstrate that the threshold energy dependence of cross sections for inelastic collisions in an optical lattice can be tuned by varying the confining potential and the magnetic field. Our results show that applying laser confinement in one dimension may stabilize ultracold systems with large scattering lengths, which may open up interesting opportunities for studies of ultracold controlled chemistry and might lead to a new research direction of ultracold chemistry in restricted geometries.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Metal-insulator transition, orbital symmetries and gaps in correlated oxides : an impurity control approach</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hossain, M. A.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The primary objective of this research is to develop and study newer ways to control electronic properties of correlated oxide systems using impurities. This goal has been achieved by introducing dilute localized 3d Mn impurities in place of a delocalized 4d Ru sites in a 2-dimensional Ru-O matrix and doping an electronically reconstructed polar surface of YBCO via surface impurities. The first part of the work concentrates on X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and Resonant Soft X-ray Scattering (RSXS) studies on lightly Mn doped Sr₃Ru₂O₇ . Our goal is to understand the electronic structure of the material both at room and low temperature and ultimately to understand the mechanism behind the low temperature metal-insulator transition in this compound. With XAS, we zoom into the local electronic structure of the impurities themselves and discovered unusual valence and crystal field level inversion in the Mn impurities. With the help of density functional theory and cluster multiplet calculations, we developed a model to describe the hierarchy of the crystal eld levels of the Mn impurities. Long range magnetic properties of the compound has been probed with Resonant Soft X-ray Scattering (RSXS) on the Mn and Ru L-edges. We have found and analyzed the (¼,¼,0) structurally forbidden diffraction peak and connected it to an antiferromagnetic instability in the parent compound. Doping dependent scattering studies revealed the magnetic structure of the low temperature insulating phase and ultimately the mechanism behind the metal-insulator transition itself. Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) has been used to investigate the low energy electronic structure of underdoped high-Tc superconductor YBCO. It has been revealed that due to the presence of polar surfaces there is electronic reconstruction on the surface of a cleaved YBCO sample. A novel technique has been devised that allows one to control the surface doping level in-situ by evaporating Potassium (K) on the YBCO surface. We showed that K tunes the surface doping level by donating electrons and thereby makes it possible to continuously tune the surface doping level throughout the phase diagram.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Development and characterization of two versions of a new single particle mass spectrometer for organic aerosol analysis that incorporate a 3D ion trap</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Simpson, Emily</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Aerosol particles are ubiquitous throughout the atmosphere and play an important role in human health, climate, and the chemistry of the atmosphere. A significant mass fraction of these particles is composed of organic species, which remain poorly characterized due to the number and diversity of species present. This thesis describes the development and characterization of two versions of a new single particle mass spectrometer with a 3D ion trap for organic aerosol studies. Version I combines CO₂ laser desorption and electron impact ionization in an ion trap. Mass spectra obtained for four species are comparable to NIST EI spectra. Tandem mass spectrometry studies are also demonstrated. The effects of vaporization energy, ionization delay time, and electron pulse width on the mass spectra and fragmentation patterns are examined. The detection limit of the instrument is found to be ~1x10⁸ molecules (350 nm diameter particle) for 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Version II integrates CO₂ laser desorption and tunable VUV ionization in an ion trap and was used for a detailed study of oleyl alcohol, oleic acid and mixtures thereof. Both the degree of fragmentation in the mass spectra and the translational energy of the vaporized molecules are found to vary as a function of desorption energy in the pure particles and as a function of composition in the mixed particles. These changes can be described by the energy absorbed per particle during desorption. We show that these effects hinder the quantitative response of the instrument and have important implications for other two step laser desorption/ionization systems. The final part of this thesis presents preliminary results from atmospherically relevant particles. Mass spectra of cigarette sidestream smoke, fulvic acid, meat cooking, and ammonium bisulfate aerosols are collected using both versions of the instrument. The two step desorption/ionization process only worked for two types of aerosols, while CO₂ only mass spectra were obtained for all four aerosol types. The suitability of CO₂ desorption strongly depended on particle composition, which will affect the applicability of the technique to atmospherically realistic aerosols. The results also suggest that CO₂ only laser desorption/ionization may be useful for field studies.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Measure-driven impulsive systems : stabilization, optimal control and applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Code, Warren Joseph</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This dissertation studies various standard facets of nonlinear control problems in the impulsive setting, using a framework of measure-driven systems. Containing a Borel measure in their dynamics, these systems model significant time scale discrepancies; the measure may weight actions at instants, producing trajectories that mix discrete and continuous dynamics on the "fast" and "slow" time scales, respectively. A central feature of our work is the careful use of a time reparametrization to transform these systems into standard, non-impulsive ones, so that the wealth of recent results in nonlinear control may be applied. Closed-loop stabilization of impulsive control systems containing a measure in the dynamics is addressed. It is proved that, as for regular affine systems, an almost everywhere continuous stabilizing impulsive feedback control law exists for such impulsive systems. An example illustrating the loop closing features is also presented. Necessary conditions for optimal control have recently been developed in the non-convex case by Clarke and Vinter, among others. We extend these results to generalized differential inclusions where a signed, vector-valued measure appears. In particular, we offer a set of stratified necessary conditions in optimal control of measure-driven systems, as well as a set of standard (global) conditions under weak regularity hypotheses on the differential inclusion maps. An auxiliary result essential to our proof extends existing free end-time necessary conditions results to Clarke's stratified framework. We work in the context of pseudo-Lipschitz multifunctions, which provide localized Lipschitz-like properties in the absence of convexity. We take a well-evolved solution concept framework in new directions, introducing a workable system of state-dependent measures and measure-based constraints, such as a forced impulse schedule, a restriction to purely discrete impulse dynamics or a state-dependent impulse restriction, and prove necessary conditions in optimal control for this new framework. This is an important step in the renewed use of measure-driven systems in modeling a broad range of applications within a familiar, mathematically sound framework. Taken together, these results span a broad range of topics in nonlinear, state-space control in the impulsive context, and refresh the measure-driven framework, paving the way for future research and further value in applications.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Surface evolution during gallium arsenide homoepitaxy with molecular beam epitaxy</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Whitwick, Michael Brian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>GaAs grown with MBE is the basis for many useful optoelectric devices. Measurements are presented of the smoothing of patterned and randomly roughened GaAs surfaces during homoepitaxy over a large range of Ga flux, substrate temperatures, arsenic fluxes, and Bi surfactant. The bulk of these measurements were taken by in-situ elastic light scattering or ex-situ AFM. These measurements provide experimental support for a non-linear continuum growth model that has been derived analytically from basic atomic level phenomena that occur in epitaxial film growth. During epitaxial growth the smoothing is observed to change in nature as the surface amplitude decreases. One of the regimes of smoothing is associated with the linear smoothing coefficients from the physically based non-linear continuum growth equation. The temperature and growth rate dependence of the smoothing coefficients are presented and found to be in good agreement with predictions from the continuum growth model. A key parameter in the continuum growth equation, the density of atomic steps, is measured independently using AFM. The step density, which agrees with theoretical predictions, is used to compute smoothing coefficients and is shown to be in agreement with the light scattering measurements. Complex shapes are observed for epitaxial growth on patterned GaAs substrates. Two characteristic surface morphologies were observed. The first is characterized by downward V-shaped cusps and rounded mounds caused by non-linear smoothing. The second morphology is similar, however the symmetry of the surface structure was inverted. This surface morphology has not been previously observed in GaAs. Step edge attachment was found to be the driving mechanism that produced both of these morphologies. Bismuth is observed to act as a surfactant in GaAs homoepitaxy. While Bi assisted growth is found to decrease the overall surface roughness, it is also found to alter the characteristics of the surface morphology. Notably, roughness at low spatial frequency was increased with the addition of Bi, while at high spatial frequency roughness was decreased. Significant changes to the shape evolution of patterned substrate are also observed when Bi is added to GaAs epitaxial growth.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Interfacial dynamics in complex fluids : studies of drop and free-surface deformation in polymer solutions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhou, Diwen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Interfacial flows in complex fluids are an important subject, scientifically rich and technologically important. The main scientific attraction comes from the fact that the microstructure of the bulk fluids may evolve during interfacial flow, and thereby generating non-Newtonian stresses that act on the interface. Thus, interfacial motion and conformation of the microstructure are coupled. Such flow situations arise in many industrial applications, including processing of polymer blends, foaming, and emulsification. In this thesis, I describe three projects aimed at exploring interfacial dynamics of viscoelastic polymeric liquids. The first project consists of finite-element simulations of drop deformation in converging flows in an axisymmetric conical geometry. The moving interface is captured using a diffuse-interface model and accurate interfacial resolution is ensured by adaptive refinement of the grid. The drop experiences a predominantly elongational flow. The amount of deformation sustained by the drop depends, besides the geometry and kinematics of the flow, on the rheology of both the drop and the matrix fluids. The second and third projects concern the same process of selective withdrawal, in which stratified layers of immiscible fluids are withdrawn from a tube placed a certain distance from the interface. We have chosen to work with an air-liquid system, with the suction tube embedded in the Newtonian or viscoelastic liquid. The second project is an experimental study, where we used video recording and imaging processing to analyze how the interfacial deformation is influenced by the non-Newtonian rheology of the liquid. We discover three regimes, subcritical, critical and supercritical. The third project consists of sharp-interface, moving-grid finite-element simulations of selective withdrawal for Newtonian and viscoelastic Giesekus liquids. The experiments and computations are in reasonable agreement. The work of this thesis has led to two main outcomes. The first is a detailed understanding of how viscoelastic stress can lead to unusual and sometimes counter-intuitive effects on interfacial deformation. The second is a potentially important new method for measuring elongational viscosity of low-viscosity liquids. This is worth further investigation considering the poor performance of existing methods.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Magnetic properties near the surface of cuprate superconductors studied using Beta-Detected NMR</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Saadaoui, Hassan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Beta-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (β-NMR) uses highly spin polarized β-emitting nuclei as a probe. Besides its use in nuclear physics, it has also become a powerful and sensitive tool in condensed matter physics and materials science. At TRIUMF, β-NMR of ⁸Li+ has been developed to study materials in a depth-resolved manner, where the implantation depth of ⁸Li+ is controlled via electrostatic deceleration. In this thesis, β-NMR of ⁸Li+ has been used to study high-Tc cuprate superconductors (HTSC). The objective of this work is to search for spontaneous magnetic fields generated by a possible time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) superconducting state near the surface of hole-doped YBa₂Cu₃O₇−d (YBCO), and study the nature of the vortex lattice (VL) in YBCO and electron-doped Pr₂−xCexCuO₄−d (PCCO). For several advantages, our measurements were carried out by implanting ⁸Li+ in thin silver films evaporated on the superconductors. In our TRSB studies, the magnetic field distribution p(B) is measured 8 nm away from the Ag/YBCO interface in magnetic fields B₀ = 5 to 100 G, applied parallel to the interface. p(B) showed significant broadening below the Tc of ab- and c-axis oriented YBCO films. The broadening signals the existence of weak disordered magnetic fields near the surface of YBCO. From the broadening’s temperature and field dependence we draw an upper limit of 0.2 G on the magnitude of spontaneous magnetic fields associated with TRSB. To study the VL, p(B) is measured at average implantation depths ranging from 20 to 90 nm away from the Ag/YBCO or Ag/PCCO interface in B₀ = 0.1 to 33 kG, applied perpendicular to the surface. p(B) showed a dramatic broadening below Tc as expected from the emerging field lines of the VL in the superconductor. In YBCO, p(B) is symmetric and the dependence on B0 is much weaker than expected from an ideal VL, indicating that the vortex density varies across the face of the sample on a long length scale, likely due to vortex pinning at twin boundaries. In PCCO, a 2D VL is established due to the high anisotropy of the superconductor leading to a nearly symmetric p(B).</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A wave equation approach to ultrasound elastography</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Baghani, Ali</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Tissue elastography is a field of medical imaging which deals with obtaining images of tissue mechanical properties, in particular tissue elasticity. Every elastography imaging system has three major components: an exciter, an imaging system, and an image processing software module. The principle of operation of these systems is that softer and harder tissues react differently to a mechanical excitation. The imaging system captures images of the tissue as the mechanical exciter deforms the tissue. The image processing software module then computes the tissue motion from the acquired images, and solves an inverse problem to obtain tissue elasticity from tissue displacements. In ultrasound elastography all three components of the displacement are not available, and the measurement is carried out only on the imaging plane. The problem of inversion using partial measurements is an inherently challenging problem. To solve this problem the phase speed is estimated in the first place. This thesis studies the process of estimating tissue elasticity from tissue displacements, using the phase speed estimation. It is shown that, in general, the elasticity cannot be inferred from the phase speed, but under certain boundary and excitation conditions, a relationship exists between the phase speed and the elasticity. However the relationship depends on the boundary and excitation conditions. Based on the developed results, a novel rheometry method is proposed for visco-elastic characterization of tissue samples. To increase the resolution of the elasticity images it is of interest to use higher frequencies of excitation. However the inherent low frame rate of ultrasound systems posed a limitation. A novel high-frame-rate ultrasound system is introduced which is capable of tracking motions of up to 500Hz. The high-frame-rate system is used in conjunction with the inversion algorithms to form an elastography system. The performance of the system is tested experimentally on tissue mimicking material having hard and soft inclusions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Three-dimensional flow through forming fabrics and the motion of flexible fibres in flow</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Vakil, Ali</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This dissertation addresses the 3D flow through forming fabrics. In the first part of this thesis, the single phase 3D flow through certain specific fabrics was modeled. In practice, the Reynolds number of the fabric flow, based on paper-side filament diameter, is around 100. Consequently, it is not too surprising that the permeability of the fabrics was found to vary approximately as Re ⁻⁰˙⁴, which is intermediate between the expected low Re (Re⁻¹) and high Re (Re⁰) limits. The resistance of a multilayer fabric was found to be nearly equal to the sum of the resistance of each layer considered in isolation. The effect of filament-scale and weave-scale flow non-uniformity on the fiber distribution in the finished paper was considered. For one specific fabric, there was 3 times more chance for short fibers to accumulate initially over openings than blockages of the fabric. Jet-to-wire speed ratio was found to have an insignificant effect on permeability results, but a marked effect on the Machine Direction shear stress in the vicinity of the paper-side filaments. In an attempt to model sheet formation, numerical simulations of the motion of a single fiber in the flow field of a cylinder was carried out as a canonical test case of the fiber/filament interaction system. Seven dimensionless groups govern the problem. A range of dimensionless groups were found for which the fiber hung up on the cylinder, whereas for other values of the dimensionless groups the fiber slid over the cylinder. In general, longer and more flexible fibers had a greater likelihood to be caught by the filament. Yawed finite aspect ratio cylinders at moderate Reynolds numbers are approximate representations of fibers in the flow field of forming fabrics. No analytical solution or any experimental data are reported in the literature to predict the drag and lift force on such particles in such flows. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to find the drag and lift coefficients of inclined finite circular cylinders at Reynolds numbers in the range 1-40. The simulations showed that the Independence Principle was highly inaccurate for low inclination angles.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Rheology of synovial fluid with and without viscosupplements in patients with osteoarthritis : a pilot study</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bhuanantanondh, Petcharatana</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that is characterized by the breakdown of articular cartilage. Over 80% of people over the age of 60 show radiographic evidence of OA. Rheology of synovial fluid is of interest because of its significance in the joint lubrication. However, there are still many questions related to synovial fluid rheology and its relation with OA. Although viscosupplementation has been used as a treatment for OA for many years, its clinical effect remains controversial. Therefore, the purposes of this pilot study were to determine rheological behavior of synovial fluid in patients with OA to better understand its role in joint lubrication, and to determine in vitro the effect of different viscosupplements on the rheological properties of synovial fluid. A detailed rheological characterization of synovial fluid from 22 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty was performed. The results showed that synovial fluid in OA exhibited a non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior and viscoelastic properties. Within an individual, rheological properties of synovial fluid from the left knee differed substantially from the right knee. Moreover, rheopectic behavior (i.e. shear stress increases over time at a constant shear rate) was observed in OA synovial fluid. All three viscosupplements considered in this study (i.e. Orthovisc®, Suplasyn®, and Synvisc®) exhibited a non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior. Within the range of frequency from 0.1 to 10 Hz., Orthovisc® exhibited a linear viscoelastic behavior, whereas Synvisc® and Suplasyn® exhibited a gel-like behavior and a viscous-like behavior, respectively. By adding viscosupplements to OA synovial fluid, the results showed cross linked high molecular weight viscosupplement is more efficient than the non cross-linked ones in improving the overall rheological properties of synovial fluid. Furthermore, rheological properties of synovial fluid mixed with viscosupplements in vitro were nearly unchanged over 2 weeks. In conclusions, synovial fluid in OA exhibited a non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior, viscoelastic properties, and rheopectic behavior. Cross-linked viscosupplement is more efficient than the non cross-linked ones in improving the overall rheological properties of synovial fluid. The rheology of synovial fluid mixed with viscosupplements was nearly unchanged over 2 weeks.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Conditional source-term estimation methods for turbulent reacting flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jin, Bei</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) methods are used to obtain chemical closure in turbulent combustion simulation. A Laminar Flamelet Decomposition (LFD) and then a Trajectory Generated Low-Dimensional Manifold (TGLDM) method are combined with CSE in Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulation of non-premixed autoigniting jets. Despite the scatter observed in the experimental data, the predictions of ignition delay from both methods agree reasonably well with the measurements. The discrepancy between predictions of these two methods can be attributed to different ways of generating libraries that contain information of detailed chemical mechanism. The CSE-TGLDM method is recommended for its seemingly better performance and its ability to transition from autoignition to combustion. The effects of fuel composition and injection parameters on ignition delay are studied using the CSE-TGLDM method. The CSE-TGLDM method is then applied in Large Eddy Simulation of a non-premixed, piloted jet flame, Sandia Flame D. The adiabatic CSE-TGLDM method is extended to include radiation by introducing a variable enthalpy defect to parameterize TGLDM manifolds. The results are compared to the adiabatic computation and the experimental data. The prediction of NO formation is improved, though the predictions of temperature and major products show no significant difference from the adiabatic computation due to the weak radiation of the flame. The scalar fields are then extracted and used to predict the mean spectral radiation intensities of the flame. Finally, the application of CSE in turbulent premixed combustion is explored. A product-based progress variable is chosen for conditioning. Presumed Probability Density Function (PDF) models for the progress variable are studied. A modified version of a laminar flame-based PDF model is proposed, which best captures the distribution of the conditional variable among all PDFs under study. A priori tests are performed with the CSE and presumed PDF models. Reaction rates of turbulent premixed flames are closed and compared to the DNS data. The results are promising, suggesting that chemical closure can be achieved in premixed combustion using the CSE method.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>High electron gain from single walled carbon nanotubes stimulated by interaction with an electron beam</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Michan, Mario</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Carbon nanotubes, hollow cylindrical structures made of carbon atoms with diameters in the order of a few nanometres, are attractive candidates for electron emission applications. A detailed characterization of the phenomenon so-called electron-stimulated field-emission from carbon nanotubes is presented in this thesis. An electron beam hitting the tip of a nanotube biased near the threshold of field-emission can stimulate the emission of a large number of electrons from the nanotube tip. The result of this interaction is that high electron gains can be obtained with very small stimulating electron beam currents. Electron gains of up to 2300 were recorded. This is important as this effect could form the basis of several vacuum nanoelectronic devices. Possible direct and indirect electron-nanotube interaction mechanisms responsible for this high gain are discussed and substantiated through simulations. The design and assembly of an ultra high vacuum apparatus for more controlled future experiments is also presented.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Why be normal? : single crystal growth and X-ray spectroscopy reveal the startlingly unremarkable electronic structure of Tl-2201</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Peets, Darren</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>High-quality platelet single crystals of Tl₂Ba₂CuO₆±δ (Tl-2201) have been grown using a novel time-varying encapsulation scheme, minimizing the thallium oxide loss that has plagued other attempts and reducing cation substitution. This encapsulation scheme allows the melt to be decanted from the crystals, a step previously impossible, and the remaining cation substitution is homogenized via a high-temperature anneal. Oxygen annealing schemes were developed to produce sharp superconducting transitions from 5 to 85 K without damaging the crystals. The crystals' high homogeneity and high degree of crystalline perfection are further evidenced by narrow rocking curves; the crystals are comparable to YSZ-grown YBa₂Cu₃O₆₊δ by both metrics. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) ascertained the crystals' composition to be Tl₁.₉₂₀₍₂₎Ba₁.₉₆₍₂₎Cu₁.₀₈₀₍₂₎O₆₊δ; X-ray diffraction found the composition of a Tc = 75 K crystal to be Tl₁.₉₁₄₍₁₄₎Ba₂Cu₁.₀₈₆₍₁₄₎O₆.₀₇₍₅₎, in excellent agreement. X-ray refinement of the crystal structure found the crystals orthorhombic at most dopings, and their structure to be in general agreement with previous powder data. Cation-substituted Tl-2201 can be orthorhombic, orthorhombic crystals can be prepared, and these superconduct, all new results. X-ray diffraction also found evidence of an as yet unidentified commensurate superlattice modulation. The Tl-2201 crystals' electronic structure were studied by X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopies (XAS/XES). The Zhang-Rice singlet band gains less intensity on overdoping than expected, suggesting a breakdown of the Zhang-Rice singlet approximation, and one thallium oxide band does not disperse as expected. The spectra correspond very closely with LDA band structure calculations, and do not exhibit the upper Hubbard bands arising from strong correlations seen in other cuprates. The spectra are noteworthy for their unprecedented (in the high-Tc cuprates) simplicity. The startling degree to which the electronic structure can be explained bodes well for future research in the cuprates. The overdoped cuprates, and Tl-2201 in particular, may offer a unique opportunity for understanding in an otherwise highly confusing family of materials.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Surface reconstructions during growth of GaAs₁-xBix alloys</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Masnadi Shirazi Nejad, Mostafa</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>GaAs₁-xBix is an exciting new semiconductor alloy with numerous promising applications. Incorporation of Bi into GaAs allows for a large reduction of the GaAs bandgap per percent incorporation (7x greater than In, with modest increase in lattice size) and shows strong photoluminescence (PL) and low material degradation associated with Bi. This will allow for longer wavelength devices to be grown on GaAs substrates, than is currently possible with pseudomorphic InGaAs on GaAs. Since Bi has a strong tendency for surface segregation, the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of GaAs₁-xBix is challenging. To achieve Bi incorporation, this alloy requires unconventional MBE growth conditions such as a low substrate temperature and low As overpressure. The low As:Ga flux ratio also makes Ga and Bi droplet formation a problem. Therefore careful control of growth parameters, especially the As:Ga flux ratio is necessary. In this regard reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) is used as a crucial tool in locating the optimum growth conditions. The surface reconstruction phase map of GaAs₁-xBix is explored in this study as a function of growth temperature and As:Ga ratio. For comparison, the phase map of GaAs, at low temperatures is also obtained. It is observed that the (1×3), (2×3), (2×4) surface phases are common between GaAs and GaAs₁-xBix but due to the presence of Bi, a new (2×1) reconstruction appears in the case of GaAs₁-xBix. This new reconstruction is observed for various Bi fluxes, showing the evolution of this phase with substrate temperature and As:Ga flux ratio. In addition, the emissivity of the (2×1) surface was found to be lower than for the other As-rich reconstructed surfaces (e.g. (1×3) and (2×3) surfaces) which suggests that the (2×1) surface phase is metallic. Throughout this work, several GaAs₁-xBix films were grown with (1×3) and (2×1) reconstructions at different substrate temperatures. Each film is characterized using high-resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence spectra (PL) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Superior crystal quality, higher Bi incorporation and higher intensity PL was observed for GaAs₁-xBix samples grown on (2×1) surfaces, relative to samples grown on (1×3) surfaces.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A direct measurement of pmu xi from muon decay</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bueno, James</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The asymmetry of the positron distribution in polarised muon decay provides confirmation that the weak interaction maximally violates parity conservation. Since 1957 the quantity Pmu xi has been measured with increasing precision, where Pmu is the polarisation of the muon, and xi is a parameter describing the asymmetry. Thus far the results have been consistent with the standard model using a (V-A) interaction. A new measurement of pmu xi using the TRIUMF Weak Interaction Symmetry Test (TWIST) spectrometer is presented in this thesis. The result is pmu xi = 1.00084 +- 0.00035 (stat.) -0.00063,+0.00165 (syst.), which is a factor of 3.2 more precise than a previous TWIST direct measurement, and a factor of 7.0 more precise than the pre-TWIST value. New limits are set on physics beyond the standard model, including the weak decay of right-handed muons, and left-right symmetric models where a (V+A) current is introduced to conserve parity at higher energies.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Mirsadeghi, Seyed Hamed</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A photonic crystal (PC) structure for trapping a 50nm radius dielectric particle at a precise location on a silicon surface in an organic solvent environment has been designed and all of its key components have been fabricated. The high gradient of electric field intensity in a PC cavity mode, with wavelength ~ 1.5 microns, exerts a radiation force toward the center of the cavity. The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) modeling method was used to design a symmetric (input/output) structure that consists of two grating couplers, two parabolic tapered waveguides, two single mode ridge waveguides, two photonic crystal waveguides and a single three-missing-hole (L3) PC cavity. The radiation force on the dielectric sphere was exactly calculated using FDTD simulations to evaluate the Maxwell Stress Tensor (MST) in the presence of the particle to be trapped. This result was compared to that obtained using the simpler dipole approximation, and good agreement between them was found. The fabrication of the structure was done by electron beam lithography and chlorine plasma etching. The Q factors for some of the fabricated samples were measured from the cavity enhanced photoluminescence emission of PbSe quantum dots deposited on the sample surface. A vertical Q factor of 3600 (in vacuum environment) was measured for an isolated cavity, which corresponds to a Qv of 3800 ( in solvent environment) in the FDTD simulations. Also, the Q, of the overall structure (cavity and the waveguides) was measure to be 1050 in vacuum, which from simulations is equivalent to a Q of 1800 in a solvent. These Q values and the resonant frequencies of the modes are in close, but not perfect agreement with the simulation results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A new method for characterizing spindle radial error motion : a two-dimensional point of view</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jamalian, Arash</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents a new two dimensional (2D) method based on complex Fourier series to characterize spindle radial error motions. One subtlety of spindle metrology is that the radial motion measurements have an undesired component caused by the ball installation eccentricity. The current standard methods cannot distinguish between this undesired component and fundamental radial error motion of spindle. The new 2D method identifies what fundamental radial error motion is and how it can be distinguished from the test ball installation eccentricity. Current standard methods give the consequence of radial error motion in two classes of spindle applications, but not the radial error motion itself. By identifying the fundamental radial error motion, the 2D method can not only determine the axis of rotation radial error motion, but also the consequence of error motion in all classes of spindle applications, including a new class of applications with two radial sensitive directions. Experiments are carried out on two types of spindles to confirm that fundamental radial error motion not only exists but it can have a magnitude higher than any other error motion component. The 2D method is used to find the actual radial error motion of the spindles as well as the consequence of error motion in applications. Possible physical causes of the fundamental error motion are also discussed and experiments are carried out to identify their actual effect on the spindles under test.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Viscous fluid instabilities under an elastic sheet</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Khomenko, Maria</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis considers the flow of thin fluid film between an elastic sheet and a rigid plane. We derive a mathematical model for the flow from the Navier-Stokes equations using the lubrication approximation and develop numerical and similarity solutions to this problem. An experimental apparatus was developed to investigate this phenomenon, and the results of the mathematical model were compared with experimental data. Chapter 3 examines the evolution of a fixed fluid volume under gravitational forces on a horizontal plane. The evolution of the fluid mass profile and the progression of the fluid front are determined from the numerical solutions, as well as experimentally. The favourable comparison between the numerical solutions and the experimental results establishes the validity of the model. Chapters 4-5 considers the evolution of a thin fluid flow under an elastic on an inclined plane. We establish a traveling wave solution for this flow. A linear stability analysis yields the criterion for the existence of unstable modes and establishes the growth rate and wavelength of the most unstable mode. Instability is promoted by increasing the inclination of the plane. For low angles, the numerical and experimental growth rates were in good agreement, while the wavelengths were experimentally of the same order and numerically computed wavelengths had little variation. The long term behaviour of the fluid front is studied analytically via a similarity solution in Chapter 6.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Pipe flow of homogeneous slurry</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hallbom, Donald John</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The objective of this Thesis is to devise a system for the "rheology-based design" of non-settling (homogeneous) slurry pipelines that is more conducive to application by practicing engineers without impairing its accuracy or utility for research purposes. The cornerstone is the development of a new rheological model and constitutive equation for homogeneous slurry based on the aggregation/deaggregation of the suspended mineral particles. This “yield plastic” model is shown to describe a family of models that includes the Newtonian, Bingham plastic and Casson models as special cases. It also closely approximates the results of many consistency models, including power law, yield power law, Cross and Carreau-Yasuda. The yield plastic model is then used to develop design equations to determine the pressure-gradient of laminar and turbulent pipe flow. A relative energy dissipation criterion is proposed for the laminar-turbulent transition and shown to be consistent with currently used transition models for Newtonian and Bingham fluids. Finally, a new dimensionless group (the “stress number”) is proposed that is directly proportional to the pressure-gradient and independent of the velocity. When the design equations are presented graphically in terms of the stress number and the plastic Reynolds number, the resulting “design curve diagram” is shown to be a dimensionless (pressure-gradient vs. velocity) pipe flow curve. The net result is that the hydraulic design of homogeneous slurry systems only requires the use of a single constitutive equation and three engineering design equations. The results are presented in a conceptually easy form that will foster an intuitive understanding of non-Newtonian pipe flow. This will assist engineers to understand the impact of slurry rheology when designing, operating and troubleshooting slurry pipelines and, in the future, other slurry related processes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Micro flow control using thermally responsive polymer solutions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bazargan, Vahid</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Microfluidics refers to devices and methods for controlling and manipulating fluid flows at length scales less than a millimeter. Miniaturization of a laboratory to a small device, usually termed as lab-on-a-chip, is an advanced technology that integrates a microfluidic system including channels, mixers, reservoirs, pumps and valves on a micro scale chip and can manipulate very small sample volumes of fluids. While several flow control concepts for microfluidic devices have been developed to date, here flow control concepts based on thermally responsive polymer solutions are presented. In particular, flow control concepts base on the thermally triggered reversible phase change of aqueous solutions of the polymer Pluronic will be discussed. Selective heating of small regions of microfluidic channels, which leads to localized gel formation in these channels and reversible channel blockage, will be used to control a membrane valve that controls flow in a separate channel. This new technology will allow generating inexpensive portable bioanalysis tools where microvalve actuation occurs simply through heaters at a constant pressure source without a need for large external pressure control systems as is currently the case. Furthermore, a concept for controlled cross-channel transport of particles and potentially cells is presented that relies on the continuous regeneration of a gel wall at the diffusive interface of two co-streaming fluids in a microfluidic channel.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>In situ analysis of lateral triterpenoid distribution in plant cuticular waxes using Raman microspectroscopy and non-linear optical imaging</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yu, Marcia Mei Lin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The above-ground organs of plants are covered by a protective cuticle, an extracellular membrane performing important physiological and ecological functions, that consists of cuticular wax and the fatty acid-derived polymer cutin. Until the past decade, the cuticular wax was thought to be a homogenous mixture. Hence, previous interpretations relating the chemical composition and biological functions of the cuticular wax were based on the total wax composition, an average taken over the entire area and depth of the cuticle. However, recent selective sampling experiments showed a heterogeneity of the chemical composition between different wax layers. The finding of this heterogeneity imposes the need for a more accurate description of the cuticle in order to understand how the chemical composition determines the biological function. This thesis is aimed at mapping the lateral patterns of cuticular waxes on Prunus laurocerasus leaf surfaces with microscopic resolution to provide spatially resolved chemical information in the interest of describing the cuticle more accurately. Firstly, this thesis examines the post-acquisitional data processing and analysis techniques followed by the investigation of the potential of Raman microspectroscopy for the simultaneous detection of structurally similar triterpenoids in plant cuticles. Relative composition analysis was performed on artificial triterpenoid mixtures and the resulting calculated triterpenoid ratios were consistent with the expected values. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the linear near infrared (NIR) Raman, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), and third harmonic generation (THG) spectra of isolated adaxial and abaxial P. laurocerasus cuticles demonstrated the in situ detectability of the triterpenoids using this approach. Raman maps of the adaxial cuticle showed that the triterpenoids accumulate to relatively high concentrations over the periclinal regions of the pavement cells, while the very long chain aliphatic wax constituents are distributed fairly evenly across the entire adaxial cuticle. In the analysis of the abaxial cuticles, the triterpenoids were found to accumulate in greater amounts over the guard cells relative to the pavement cells. The very long chain aliphatic compounds accumulated in the cuticle above the anticlinal cell walls of the pavement cells, and were found at low concentration above the periclinals and the guard cells. The main research contributions include evaluating various data processing techniques as candidates for automated implementation and applying different imaging techniques to obtain chemical information about the lateral concentration gradient of the triterpenoid components in the cuticles, with high spatial resolution. This thesis also provides the first direct (i.e. in situ) evidence for lateral spatial heterogeneity of triterpenoids in the cuticle of a model species, P. laurocerasus. This work is expected to impel further structure-function investigation of the cuticular membranes of plants.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Viscoelastic flows within eccentric rotating cylinders : journal bearings</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Liu, Kai</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Experiments have shown that the addition of small amounts of long-chained polymer additives to a Newtonian fluid produces desirable lubricants. Additives added to oil make the fluid viscoelastic. The effect of viscoelasticity on lubrication characteristics has recently taken on added significance with the move to yet lower-viscosity lubricants for improved energy efficiency. Any factor influencing load-bearing capacity and wear is clearly of renewed importance. The general trend towards the usage of high performance lubricants and environmentally friendly products also support the design of new lubricants. This thesis is aimed at investigating viscoelastic flows within eccentric rotating cylinders (practical application - journal bearings) using a commercial finite element software POLYFLOW. Numerous validations are performed and excellent agreements are achieved. Steady shear and small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) experiments are performed for specific lubricants including mineral-based and bio-based lubricants to characterize their rheological behavior. Experimental data are fitted by a viscoelastic constitutive model used for numerical simulations. The effects of fluid viscoelasticity between eccentric rotating cylinders on the flow field and on the lubrication performances are revealed in 2D and 3D respectively. From 2D investigation, an increased load capacity on the inner cylinder is found to be achieved by increasing the viscoelasticity of flow. For the first time, to our knowledge, 3D results for an UCM (Upper-Convected Maxwell) fluid at steady state are presented and the flow patterns along the axial direction within the eccentric rotating cylinders are investigated. The viscoelastic effects of those lubricants on the journal bearing performances are revealed and compared at various temperatures. The modeling and numerical simulations used to predict the flow of lubricant in a journal bearing can generate important economic benefits. This research will lead to advanced predictive tools that can be used to improve the design of journal bearing and to propose new economically viable and environmentally friendly lubricants.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantitative field constraints on the dynamics of silicic magma chamber rejuvenation and overturn</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bain, Amelia Anne</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A number of recent papers by Bachmann and co-authors investigate a hypothesis that the catastrophic eruption of large-volume, crystal-rich silicic magmas is a consequence of reheating (so-called rejuvenation) and overturn of partially molten, buoyant silicic material by repeated injection of dense, hot mafic magma. In support of this model, we analyse an extensive suite of kinematic indicators for the buoyant overturn of silicic crystal mush layers of the Coastal Maine Magmatic Province, apparently in response to the injection and cooling of hot, dense mafic magmas. We use spectral analysis, microtextural analysis and scaling theory to identify, characterise and understand the length-scales of deformation along sharp interfaces separating mafic and silicic intrusive layers, from the scale of individual crystals (~1 cm) to in excess of the mafic layer thickness (&gt;100 m). Deformations at the largest scale lengths are comparable to the silicic layer thickness, consistent with Rayleigh-Taylor theory, and support a conjecture that mafic recharge can cause large-scale overturning of silicic magma chambers. By contrast, deformations at the scale of crystals probably record buoyancy effects related to melt percolation and intermediate scales are explained by compaction. The evolution of rejuvenation is investigated and a condition for large-scale overturn of the chamber is proposed. This work provides the first field-based confirmation of the rejuvenation-overturn hypothesis. Additional laboratory experiments addressing the overturn of a particle-rich buoyant fluid layer overlain by a denser fluid layer are outlined in Appendix C.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Enhancing the robustness of ESPI measurements using digital image correlation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bingleman, Luke</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) provides a sensitive technique for measuring surface deformations. The technique involves comparison of the speckle phase angles within surface images measured before and after material deformation. This phase angle comparison requires that the speckle positions be consistent in all images. A lateral shift between images by just one pixel substantially degrades ESPI measurements, while a shift of two or more pixels typically causes complete speckle decorrelation and compromises the measurement entirely. To prevent such lateral motions, the specimen and the optical system must be rigidly fixed. This requirement typically prevents use of the ESPI method in applications outside laboratories or where it is necessary to remove the specimen from the optical setup between ESPI measurements. Here, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is used to track speckle motion caused by specimen displacement between ESPI measurements. The measured images can then be mathematically shifted to restore the original speckle locations, thereby recorrelating the ESPI measurements. Examples are presented where ESPI measurements are successfully made with specimen shifts in excess of 60 pixels. A novel ESPI measurement technique where the specimen is removed in between ESPI measurements is also developed and validated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Chirped-pulse laser amplifier and passive enhancement cavity for generation of extreme ultraviolet light</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lam, Matthew Hon C</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light has many potential applications, including spectroscopy and scattering experiments in physical chemistry and atmospheric science. The dominant method for producing high-flux coherent radiation in this spectral range is synchrotron radiation produced from highly subscribed national-scale facilities such as the Canadian Light Source. An alternative to synchrotron radiation is high harmonic generation (HHG), a nonlinear optical process requiring high optical intensities. This thesis describes the development of an optical amplifier and passive enhancement cavity in order to realize a table-top EUV source. A chirped-pulse ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier system outputs 20 W average power from an initial mode-locked laser outputting pulses at 80 MHz and 160 mW average power. The pulses, of duration ~250 fs after the amplifier, are coupled to a high-finesse cavity which further increases the power by a factor of 500. The peak intensity achieved in the cavity is over 10¹⁴ W/cm² and is an order of magnitude above the intensity required to drive HHG in xenon gas.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Finding conservation laws for partial differential equations</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wan, Andy Tak Shik</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, we discuss systematic methods of finding conservation laws for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). We first review the direct method of finding conservation laws. In order to use the direct method, one first seeks a set of conservation law multipliers so that a linear combination of the PDEs with the multipliers will yield a divergence expression. Once a set of conservation law multipliers is determined, one proceeds to find the fluxes of the conservation law. As the solution to the problem of finding conservation law multipliers is well-understood, in this thesis we focus on constructing the fluxes assuming the knowledge of a set of conservation law multipliers. First, we derive a new method called the flux equation method and show that, in general, fluxes can be found by at most computing a line integral. We show that the homotopy integral formula is a special case of the line integral formula obtained from the flux equations. We also show how the line integral formula can be simplified in the presence of a point symmetry of the PDE system and of the set of conservation law multipliers. By examples, we illustrate that the flux equation method can derive fluxes which would be otherwise difficult to find. We also review existing known methods of finding fluxes and make comparison with the flux equation method.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Parametric subharmonic instability and the β-effect</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chan, Ian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Parametric subharmonic instability (PSI) is a nonlinear interaction between a resonant triad of waves, in which energy is transferred from low wavenumber, high frequency modes to high wavenumber, low frequency modes. In the ocean, PSI is thought to be one of the mechanisms responsible for transferring energy from M₂ internal tides (internal gravity waves with diurnal tidal frequency) to near-inertial waves (internal gravity waves with frequency equal to the local Coriolis frequency) near the latitude of 28.9 degrees. Due to their small vertical scale, near-inertial waves generate large vertical shear and are much more efficient than M₂ internal tides at generating shear instability needed for vertical mixing, which is required to maintain ocean stratification. The earlier estimate of the time-scale for the instability is an order of magnitude larger than the time-scale observed in a recent numerical simulation (MacKinnon and Winters) (MW). An analytical model was developed by (Young et al. 2008) (YTB), and their findings agreed with the MW estimation; however as YTB assumed a constant Coriolis force, the model cannot explain the intensificaiton of PSI near 28.9 degrees as observed in the model of MW; in addition, the near-ineartial waves can propagate a significant distance away from the latitude of 28.9 degrees. This thesis extends the YTB model by allowing for a linearly varying Coriolis parameter (β-effect) as well as eddy diffusion. A linear stability analysis shows that the near-inertial wave field is unstable to perturbations. We show that the β-effect results in a shortening in wave length as the near-inertial waves propagate south; horizontal eddy diffusion is therefore enhanced to the south, and limits the meridional extent of PSI. The horizontal diffusion also affects the growth rate of the instability. A surprising result is that as the horizontal diffusion vanishes, the system becomes stable; this can be demonstrated both analytically and numerically. Mathematically, the β-effect renders the spatial differential operator nonnormal, which is characterized with the aid of pseudo-spectra. Our results suggest the possibility of large amplitude transient growth in near-inertial waves in regimes that are asymptotically stable to perturbations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Simulating viscous incompressible fluids with embedded boundary finite difference methods</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The behaviour of liquids and gases ranks among the most familiar and yet complex physical phenomena commonly encountered in daily life. To create a seamless approximation of the real world, it is clear that we must be able to accurately simulate fluids. However, a crucial element of what makes fluid behaviour so complex and compelling is its interactions with its surroundings. To simulate the motion of a fluid we cannot consider the Navier-Stokes equations in isolation; we must also examine the boundary conditions at the point where the fluid meets the world. Enforcing these boundary conditions has traditionally been a source of tremendous difficulty. Cartesian grid-based methods typically approximate the world in an unrealistic, axis-aligned block representation, while conforming mesh methods frequently suffer from poor mesh quality and expensive mesh generation. This thesis examines the use of embedded boundary finite difference methods to alleviate these shortcomings by providing a degree of sub-grid information that enables more efficient, flexible, accurate, and realistic simulations. The first key contribution of the thesis is the use of a variational approach to derive novel embedded boundary finite difference methods for fluids, by exploiting the concept of natural boundary conditions. This idea is applied first to animate the interaction between incompressible fluids and irregularly shaped dynamic rigid bodies. I then apply a similar technique to properly handle viscous free surfaces, enabling realistic buckling and coiling in viscous flows. Lastly, I unify these ideas to simulate Stokes flows in the presence of both free surface and solid boundaries, and demonstrate the method's convergence on a range of examples. The second main contribution is a study of embedded boundary methods for pressure projection in the context of unstructured Delaunay and Voronoi meshes. By eliminating the need for boundary-conforming meshes, this work enables efficient high-quality adaptive mesh generation and improves simulation accuracy. Furthermore, it demonstrates that by placing simulation samples at Voronoi sites, and choosing these sites intelligently with respect to liquid geometry, one can eliminate surface noise, improve the realism and stability of surface tension, and plausibly simulate nearly arbitrarily thin sheets and droplets.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Linear and nonlinear vibration response of thin rotating disks</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>MohammadHasani Khorasany, Ramin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Spinning disks have substantial applications in today’s industries (e.g., saw mill industries). Developing a greater understanding the dynamics of spinning disks is a central topic for this thesis. Specifically, this thesis investigates the linear and nonlinear vibrations of spinning disks. In some of the spinning disk applications, the disks may experience a rigid body translational degree of freedom. Having this degree of freedom can change the stability characteristics of spinning disks. Using analytical techniques and a two-mode approximation, the stability characteristics of elastically guided spinning disks having a rigid body translational degree of freedom are thus studied. The effect of axisymmetric non-flatness on the frequency behaviour of spinning disks is also studied. The equations of motion are based on Von Karman plate theory. Assuming that the shape of initial runout is in the form of mode shapes with zero nodal diameters, the equations of motion are then discretized. Neglecting higher order terms, the equations are linearized and the effects of different levels of initial runout on the dynamics of spinning disks are thus studied. Using experimental measurements, the effects of large deformations on the frequency behaviour and amplitude of response for the spinning disks are investigated. Disks with different thicknesses are used in this study. The disks were under the application of a space fixed external force which can produce different levels of nonlinearity. By measuring the disk displacement and conducting FFT analyses, the frequencies were measured for different levels of initial deflection. In order to see how the geometrical nonlinear terms affect the frequency behaviour of spinning disks, the nonlinear governing equations are discretized and then solved to find the equilibrium solutions. By assuming a small perturbation around the equilibrium solution, the nonlinear equations of motion are linearized. Using the linearized form of the equations of motion, the effect of large deformations of the frequency characteristics of spinning disks is analyzed. The analytical results are then compared with the experimentally obtained results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Precision electrodynamics of unconventional superconductors : microwave spectroscopy and penetration depth</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bobowski, Jake Stanley</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Precision measurements of the electrodynamics of unconventional superconductors are reported. Measurements of the magnetic penetration depth temperature dependence are made via cavity perturbation and a novel microwave spectrometer gives the surface resistance continuously from 0.05 to 26.5 GHz. The microwave conductivity of single crystals of YBa₂Cu₃O₆.₅₀ has been measured using the broadband spectrometer. Conductivity spectra were measured after preparing the crystal in the ortho-II phase in which the Cu-O chain oxygens are ordered into alternating full and empty chains. These spectra exhibit features expected for quasiparticle scattering from dilute weak impurities in a d-wave superconductor. The measurements were repeated after reducing the degree of oxygen order in the Cu-O chains. The disordered spectra retain the weak-limit scattering features, however, increased quasiparticle scattering broadens the widths. The conductivity of a new generation of samples, with an order of magnitude lower impurity concentrations, are unchanged from those of the older generation samples. In both generations of crystals the spectral widths are largely determined by residual disorder in the chains. The electrodynamics of single crystal Ba₀.₇₂K₀.₂₈Fe₂As₂ and Ba(Fe₀.₉₅Co₀.₀₅)₂As₂ have been investigated. Measurements of ∆⋌(T)are used to extract the superfluid density ⋌²(0)/⋌²(T) which is observed to approach Tc linearly indicative of mean-field behaviour. At low-temperatures, the superfluid density obeys the a power law ⋌²(0)/⋌²(T)= 1 - (T/T*)n with n varying from 2.1 to 2.7 for the three crystals studied. At T/Tc ≈ 0.04, all three samples exhibit a step-like feature of order 1 anstrom in the measured penetration depth that is of unknown origin. The surface resistance of two Ba₀.₇₂K0.₂₈Fe₂As₂ crystals reveal a sample-dependent extrinsic loss. The spectra, however, share a common temperature dependence and follow frequency squared when the extrinsic loss is removed. This frequency dependence translates to a flat quasiparticle conductivity and implies a high scattering rate(～ 200 GHz). The microwave spectroscopy of a Ba(Fe₀.₉₅Co₀.₀₅)₂As₂ sample reveals more anomalous behaviour. Even after subracting of the extrinsic loss, the surface resistance rapidly increases when the frequency scaled by Tc is above 0.04. The resistivity of the Ba(Fe₀.₉₅Co₀.₀₅)₂As₂ sample is an order of magnitude larger than that of the K-doped samples suggesting the anomalous behaviour may be activated by enhanced impurity concentrations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Holographic condensed matter theories and gravitational instability</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>He, Jianyang</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The AdS/CFT correspondence, which connects a d-dimensional field theory to a (d+1)-dimensional gravity, provides us with a new method to understand and explore physics. One of its recent interesting applications is holographic condensed matter theory. We investigate some holographic superconductivity models and discuss their properties. Both Abelian and non-Abelian models are studied, and we argue the p-wave solution is a hard-gapped superconductor. In a holographic system containing Fermions, the properties of a non-Fermi liquid with a Fermi surface are found. We show that a Landau level structure exists when external magnetic field is turned on, and argue for the existence of Fermi liquid when using the global coordinate system of AdS. Finite temperature results of the Fermion system are also given. In addition, a gravitational instability interpreted as a bubble of nothing is described, together with its field theory dual.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The influence of interference on the Kondo effect</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Malecki, Justin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The Kondo effect, wherein a local magnetic moment is screened via interactions with a continuum of quantum excitations, occurs in quantum dots with an odd number of electrons. By placing a quantum dot in an Aharanov-Bohm interferometer, one is able to probe the effects of electron interference on the manifestation of the Kondo effect. In this thesis, we present a theoretical study of the Kondo effect in a model system of a quantum dot embedded in an Aharanov-Bohm interferometer connected to two conducting leads. By transforming to the scattering basis of the direct inter-lead tunneling, we are able to describe precisely how the Kondo screening of the dot spin occurs. We calculate the Kondo temperature and zero-temperature conductance and find that both are influenced by the Aharanov-Bohm interferometer as well as the electron density in the leads. We also calculate the form of an additional potential scattering term that arises at low energies due to the breaking of particle-hole symmetry. In addition to these analytic results, a numerical renormalization group analysis of the system is presented. We fully describe the influence of the Aharanov-Bohm interferometer on the renormalization group flow of the quantum dot model and obtain strong support for the derived form of the Kondo temperature. A method for extracting the phase shifts of the strong-coupling fixed point from the numerical data is described. These phase shifts are compared with those derived analytically, providing further support for our conclusions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Relative stability in critical collapse of scalar fields with angular momentum</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Akbarian Kaljahi, Arman</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We study numerically the gravitational collapse of two massless scalar fields in spherical symmetry using an approach which incorporates some of the effects of angular momentum. Each field is characterized by a distinct angular momentum parameter, l, with l = 0, 1, 2, ., and has distinct equations of motion. We focus on black critical behaviour, in which we look for solutions, and the properties thereof, that represent the onset of black hole formation in parametrized families of initial data. Although many different critical solutions have been discovered since the early 1990's, almost all work has involved a single matter source, and by coupling more than one type of matter to the gravitational field, new and interesting questions arise. In particular, we consider the issue of the relative stability of the critical solutions in our model, in which we look for signs of instability of one field in the presence of the critical solution associated with the other. Our main result is that fields corresponding to larger values of l appear to be unstable in the context of lower-l critical solutions. This implies that in a two-field universe, the field with larger l would always dominate at precise criticality.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Mesospheric dynamics and ground-layer optical turbulence studies for the performance of ground-based telescopes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pfrommer, Thomas</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Modern astronomical instrumentation employs adaptive optics (AO) systems that correct for atmospheric distortion in real time in order to produce sharper images. The design and performance of these systems relies on the knowledge of the atmosphere both at low and high altitude. This thesis investigates the first kilometer of the atmosphere, the ground layer (GL), as well as the sodium layer at ~92 km. Newly-designed lunar scintillometers provide turbulence profiles of the GL, and high spatio-temporally resolved sodium profiles are obtained using a newly-designed lidar system for UBC's 6-m liquid-mirror. For ground layer adaptive optics systems, knowledge of the local height- and time-resolved GL turbulence is crucial to link local topography to optical turbulence and has been obtained with the help of three lunar scintillometers deployed in Chile, Hawaii and in the Canadian High Arctic. Results from measurements inside the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) dome indicate severe degradation of image quality due to a poorly vented dome and thus provide input for dome modifications. The outside median GL seeing was determined to be 0.48±0.01". Initial results from the Arctic show exceptional GL seeing conditions, better than have been found anywhere on Earth although data quantity is limited. Extremely large telescopes must correct not only for GL turbulence, but also higher atmospheric disturbances in the troposphere. The use of laser guide stars (LGS) increases sky coverage and the field of view, but relies on resonantly excited sodium atoms in the mesosphere. Upper atmospheric dynamics causes varying sodium density, which produces focus-induced wavefront errors in LGS AO systems. The UBC lidar system was built, and its high-resolution data reveal large spatial variability, strong nightly variations and meteor spikes in sodium density on sub-second time scales. The mean altitude power spectrum has been extended to scales approaching the dissipation limit, and its spectral index of -1.95±0.12 and normalization of 30±20 m²/Hz determines AO system wavefront errors of 4 nm for a 30 m, and 8 nm for a 42 m telescope per meter mean-altitude variation. Derived mean altitudes, separated by one arcmin, showed rms fluctuations of order 30 m and could cause AO performance degradation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hydrodynamics of circular free-surface long water jets in industrial metal cooling</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Seraj, Mohammad Mohsen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Control cooling in run-out table (ROT) is crucial in managing the properties of steel strip. However, industries still rely on experience and empirical methods due to the complexity and transient nature of cooling process. The associated flow features of ROT cooling received little attention in the literature. The main purpose of this research is to investigate systematically the hydrodynamics of long circular water jets impinging on fixed and moving plate with industrial scale. The fixed plate experiments showed that the impingement film and circular hydraulic jump were disturbed with surface waves and splattering. The experiments on moving plate with single impinging jet demonstrated the effect of jet flow rate and plate speed on wetting zone. For a given plate velocity, the size of wetting area increased according to jet Reynolds number. The moving impingement surface interferes with radial spreading film and the wetting front became noncircular. A new correlation for the radius of wetting front has been proposed. The effect of plate motion on liquid jets interactions were studied experimentally using multiple jets. Nonsplashing thick interaction film or thin upwash splashing fountain at the interaction zone were observed depending on process parameters. If the effect of plate motion was not promoted then the interaction flow structure was preserved similar to stationary plate. However, the moving plate could change the strong splashing fountain interaction flow to nonsplashing thick film depending on the velocity ratio of plate to jet for a given nozzle space. Higher plate speeds and/or lower jet flow rates are more likely to decrease splashing and change the fountain type interaction. Numerical simulations on stationary surface demonstrated that suggested velocity and pressure variation for short laminar jets may be adapted for long turbulent liquid jets if the gravity is considered. Generally, shear-stress transport k-ω model showed better performance after impingement. The moving plate simulations of single jet proved the distortion of the impingement zone. The shifted stagnation point produces noncircular impingement region and unsymmetrical spreading of impingement water film over the surface. Longitudinal negative velocity was occurred at higher plate velocity simulations which represent the backwash flow.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The measurement of the rare kaon decay k-plus to pi-plus, neutrino and anti-neutrino</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ives, Joss</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Brookhaven National Laboratory experiment E949 was designed to search for the rare K meson decay K⁺ → π⁺ , neutrino, and anti-neutrino, a decay sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. While previous data analyses dealt with the high π⁺ momentum region accessible for this reaction, this thesis concentrates on the lower range between 140 and 199 MeV/c. Analysis of this low π⁺ momentum region was performed to search for additional evidence of the process K⁺ → π⁺, neutrino, and anti-neutrino. A blind analysis technique was used to avoid bias when developing the selection criteria used to suppress the competing background processes. The blind analysis technique was based on identifying background sources a priori and only examining the signal region once all selection criteria and background estimates had been finalized. The background estimates were performed using a technique known as a "bifurcation method", which relied on using two uncorrelated selection criteria to suppress each background source. The analysis of an exposure of 1.71 x 10¹² K⁺ decays resulted in an observation of three events with an estimated background of 0.927 ± 0.168(stat.)⁺³²⁰-₀.₂₃₇(sys.) events and a single event sensitivity of (4.28 ± 0.43)x 10-¹⁰. Using a likelihood method, the three candidate events observed here were combine with the previous E787 and E949 results, yielding a branching ratio of ϐ(K⁺ → π⁺, neutrino, and anti-neutrino decay of (1.73+1.15-1.05) x 10⁻¹⁰ at the 68% confidence level. This branching ratio is consistent with the prediction of the Standard Model, (0.85 ± 0.07) x 10⁻¹⁰.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>MultiFLIP for energetic two-phase fluid simulation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Boyd, William Landon</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Physically-based liquid animations often ignore the influence of air, giving up interesting behaviour. We present a new method which treats both air and liquid as incompressible, more accurately reproducing the reality observed at scales relevant to computer animation. The Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) method, already shown to effectively simulate incompressible fluids with low numerical dissipation, is extended to two-phase flow by associating a phase bit with each particle. The liquid surface is reproduced at each time step from the particle positions, which are adjusted to prevent mixing near the surface and to allow for accurate surface tension. The liquid surface is adjusted around small-scale features so they are represented in the grid-based pressure projection, while separate, loosely coupled velocity fields reduce unwanted influence between the phases. The resulting scheme is easy to implement, requires little parameter tuning and is shown to reproduce lively two-phase fluid phenomena.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electronic states and transport in GaNAs and GaAsBi</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Beaton, Daniel A.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>ct: This thesis explores the effect of incorporation of nitrogen or bismuth in GaAs on electronic states and transport, namely shallow in-gap states associated with nitrogen clusters in GaNAs and the hole mobility in GaAsBi. Lowered in-gap emission intensity in GaNAs epi-layers grown in under atomically rich operation of the plasma source indicates that atomic nitrogen results in more optically efficient GaNxAs1-x films. Two significant additions made to the growth procedure of GaAsBi allowed for growth of thick, doped epi-layers: reduced growth rate and growth interrupt prior to the GaAsBi epi-layer. Hole mobility is found to decrease with increasing Bi concentration. This decrease is smaller than the analogous decrease of electron mobility in GaNAs. The temperature dependence of the hole mobility is modelled using terms for scattering from phonons, ionized impurities and a temperature independent bismuth related term. There is an increasing effect from the bismuth related term with increasing bismuth content. Calculation of the scattering cross-section based on the fitted coefficient for the 1% GaAsBi sample is in good agreement with a theoretically predicted value. For samples above 4.4% the hole mobility was found to be temperature independent and scattering cross-sections are more than an order of magnitude larger. These are indications that bismuth clusters play a significant role in reducing the hole mobility at high concentrations. GaAs, GaNAs and GaAsBi were incorporated in to device structures: Schottky diodes and p-i-n LEDs. Several defects were detected using DLTS and an increasing trend of defects for decreasing growth temperature found. Two hole traps were found to be related to growth of GaNAs, where only one was related to nitrogen incorporation. The device structure of the LEDs prevented an in-depth analysis and poor surface morphology of GaAsBi epi-layers resulted in leaky devices. While further work is required, it was found that the inclusion of a growth interrupt introduced many shallow traps. Optical measurements on the LEDs showed that the electroluminescence from the GaAsBi layer was temperature insensitive, while the emission from the GaAs layers followed the expected Varshni relation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Initial data for axially symmetric black holes with distorted apparent horizons</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tonita, Aaryn</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The production of axisymmetric initial data for distorted black holes at a moment of time symmetry is considered within the (3+1) context of general relativity. The initial data is made to contain a distorted marginally trapped surface ensuring that, modulo cosmic censorship, the spacetime will contain a black hole. The resulting equations on the complicated domain are solved using the piecewise linear finite element method which adapts to the curved surface of the marginally trapped surface. The initial data is then analyzed to calculate the mass of the space time as well as an upper bound on the fraction of the total energy available for radiation. The families of initial data considered contain no more than few percent of the total energy available for radiation even in cases of extreme distortion. It is shown that the mass of certain initial data slices depend to first order on the area of the marginally trapped surface and the gaussian curvature of prominent features.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Modeling polarons in transition-metal oxides</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lau, Bayo</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This work is a series of reports on progress in the description of electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions in transition-metal oxides, with an emphasis to the class of high-Tc superconducting cuprates. Combinations of numerical and analytical approaches were devised and developed to study large-scale models, which distinguish cation and anion sites of the realistic lattice structure. The many results range from incremental deviation to significant difference compared to those of the widely-accepted simple models without such distinction. A previously proposed numerical scheme and a perturbation approach were adapted to study the one-dimensional breathing-mode model, which describes a charge carrier interacting with vibrating anions. The effort yielded the first accurate benchmark result for all parameters values of the model. Based on a physical insight about the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a two-dimensional square lattice, an octapartite approach was devised to model the low-energy states. The efficiency of the resulting numerical approach was showcased with the explicit solution to a record-breaking 64-spin torus. A spin-polaron model was derived to model holes injected into cuprate's quasi two-dimensional copper-oxygen layer. Total-spin-resolved exact diagonalization was performed for a single fermionic hole in a record-breaking cluster with 32 copper and 64 oxygen sites. The solutions revealed important physics missed by previous studies. The octapartite approach was then developed to solve the spin-polaron model with two extra holes in the same cluster. The accuracy and efficiency of the method were established. Enhanced singlet correlation between two holes was observed. The preliminary results justify the need for an in-depth study.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Newtonian and elastic liquid jet interaction with a moving surface</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Keshavarz, Bavand</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the railroad industry a friction modifying agent may be applied to the rail or to the wheel in the form of a liquid jet. In this mode of application the interaction between the high speed liquid jet and a fast moving surface is important. Seven different Newtonian liquids with widely varying shear viscosities along with twelve different solutions of polyethylenoxide (PEO) and water with varying relaxation times were tested to isolate the effect of viscosity and elasticity from other fluid properties. Tests for the Newtonian liquids were done with five surfaces having different roughness heights to investigate the effects of surface roughness. High speed video imaging was employed to scrutinize the interaction between the impacting jet and the moving surface. For both Newtonian and Elastic liquids and all surfaces, decreasing the Reynolds number reduced the incidence of splash and consequently enhanced the transfer efficiency. At the elevated Weber numbers of the testing, the Weber number had a much smaller impact on splash than did the Reynolds number. The ratio of the surface velocity to the jet velocity has only a small effect on the splash, whereas increasing the roughness-height-to-jet-diameter ratio substantially decreased the splash threshold. Moreover, the Deborah number was also salient to the splash of elastic liquids.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Mathematical modeling of interaction of wet particles and application to fluidized beds</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Darabi, Pirooz</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In many industrial operations, such as fluidized bed granulators, coaters, and fluid cokers, a binding or reacting liquid is introduced into the system. Due to the effects of liquid, the multi-phase transport phenomena of these systems are more complicated compared to conventional gas-solid fluidization systems. In this thesis, mathematical modeling is used to study the interaction of wet particles. First, a coalescence model is developed to describe the binary collision of wet particles. The model is in the form of a wet coefficient of restitution and is used to determine the critical velocity—the boundary between coalescence or rebound outcomes—for a range of capillary numbers. Model predictions are compared with the available experimental data and good agreement is found. The model accounts for both liquid viscosity and surface tension effects and is used to investigate the boundary between collisions with dominant capillary and respective viscous effects. Then, by incorporating time- and temperature-dependant variations of the viscosity and thickness of the liquid coating, the model is used to determine the agglomeration tendency of bitumen-coated coke particles in fluid cokers. A simplified mathematical model and numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations are used to study the rupture of stretching liquid bridges between two solid spherical particles. The simplified model considers the geometry of the problem in which the gas-liquid interface is represented with a parabola. The numerical simulations of the Navier Stokes equations are performed with FLUENT and are used to investigate the viscous, surface tension, inertial, gravitational, and contact angle effects on the rupture distance and liquid distribution. Finally, the interaction of multiple wet particles is addressed by implementing the wet coefficient of restitution proposed in this thesis, using MFIX, an open-source Discrete Element Method (DEM) tool. DEM simulations of a fluidized bed consisting of mono-sized solid spherical particles pre-coated with identical liquid coatings are performed, and the effect of coating viscosity and thickness on the fluidization behaviour is investigated. Snapshots of the instantaneous particle positions are presented, and time-averaged values of the bed centroid in the y-direction, wet coefficient of restitution, and relative normal collision velocity are analyzed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Topological currents in dense matter</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Charbonneau, Arthur James</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis introduces the idea of a topological current that flows in regions with large magnetic fields, dense matter, and parity violation. We propose that such a current exists in the cores of neutron stars and may be responsible for the large proper motion (kicks) observed in some pulsars. This current is similar to the charge separation effect and chiral magnetic effect that may be responsible for parity (℘) and charge conjugation-parity (C℘) violation observed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). We start by deriving the topological current two ways. The first is a macroscopic derivation where we appeal to an anomaly induced by the presence of a fictitious axial field. The second method is microscopic, in which we consider how the modes of the Dirac equation in a magnetic field and chemical potential contribute to the current. We then discuss in great detail the elements necessary for a topological current to exist in a dense star. Our concern then rests with calculating the magnitude of topological currents in the many phases of matter thought to exist in dense stars. We choose four representative processes to investigate: nuclear matter, hyperons, kaon condensates, and strange quark matter. We then suppose that this current may somehow transfer its momentum out of the star, either by being physically ejected or by emitting radiation, causing a kick. We also discuss how the current may induce magnetic helicity and a toroidal magnetic field in the core of the star. We end by discussing the topological current in terms of the AdS/CFT correspondence, a powerful tool that allows one to obtain results from strongly coupled field theories by transferring the problem to the language of a weakly coupled gravitational theory. We introduce a toy model to how one might introduce topological currents into the AdS/CFT framework.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fractionation of particle suspensions in a viscoplastic fluid : towards a novel process</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Madani, Ario</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The focus of this thesis is the separation or sorting of particle suspensions in a yield stress or viscoplastic fluid. Although the process is applicable to most industrial suspensions, the motivation of the work stems from pulp and paper industry,i.e. papermaking and microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) suspensions. The work is presented in four different yet complementary studies. In the first study, the concept of particle fractionation in a viscoplastic fluid is introduced. Here this novel principle is demonstrated, batch wise, by measuring the difference in centrifugal force required to initiate motion of an initially stable particle suspension in a gel. The criteria for motion is delineated as the ratio of the centrifugal force to yield stress as a function of particle size and orientation. Demonstration experiments are given to illustrate that the separation process is very efficient. In the second and third studies we demonstrate the principle on two industrial suspensions, i.e. a SBK (semi-bleached kraft) papermaking fibre and MFC. With papermaking fibres, it is shown that efficient separation, based upon cell wall thickness can be achieved. With MFC, it is shown that the process is more efficient than traditional separation techniques, i.e hydrocyclone and pressure screen. In the final study, we speculate regarding the conditions required to make a continuous process based upon the batch testings. Here, it is identified that a spiral Poiseuille flow would be sufficient to achieve separation. The questions addressed in this study are what is the size of the unyielded region for this flow field and what is the bound for transition to turbulent flow. It was found that the magnitude of the swirling flow does not affect the size of the plug and the axial velocity is decoupled from the rotational rate. In addition, the yielded region is always formed in the middle of the annular gap. To address the flow state, a linear stability analysis was performed using the method of normal modes. The flow was found to be linearly stable for all conditions tested.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Multi-layer flows with yield stress fluids</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hormozi, Sarah</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Interfacial instabilities of multi-layer shear flows may be eliminated by astute positioning of yield stress fluid layers that remain unyielded at the interface(s). The contribution of this thesis comes in three parts. Firstly, we have performed a computational study of these flows in the setting of a Newtonian core fluid surrounded by a Bingham lubricating fluid, within pipe and channel configurations. The simulations include an inlet geometry in the computational model and study the multi-layer flows, both as the fluids are initially injected (start up) and later the established steady flows (development lengths). Nonlinear perturbations are also studied, showing in particular that during energy decay of stable perturbations the initial rapid decay of the perturbation kinetic energy relates to reforming/breaking of the unyielded plug and is followed by slower viscous decay. For axisymmetric perturbations these flows can be stable to order unity initial perturbation amplitudes and for Re[sign omitted]10². The channel geometry allows for symmetry breaking and appears to be less stable. A number of interesting effects are explored using the channel geometry. Secondly, we focus on demonstrating whether the stable core annular flow can be achieved when lubricating a visco-elastic core fluid with a yield stress fluid. We have performed over 100 experiments using Carbopol solutions as the lubricating yield stress fluid and Polyethylene Oxide solutions as the visco-elastic fluid. Thirdly, we have applied the energy stability method to study nonlinear stability of a core-annular flow of an Oldroyd-B fluid surrounded by a Bingham fluid. Together with the experimental study, this shows that visco-elasticity is not a barrier to use of this methodology.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical analysis of the ultrarelativistic and magnetized Bondi--Hoyle problem</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Penner, Andrew Jason</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, we present numerical studies of models for the accretion of fluids and magnetofluids onto rotating black holes. Specifically, we study three main scenarios, two of which treat accretion of an unmagnetized perfect fluid characterized by an internal energy sufficiently large that the rest-mass energy of the fluid can be ignored. We call this the ultrarelativistic limit, and use it to investigate accretion flows which are either axisymmetric or restricted to a thin disk. For the third scenario, we adopt the equations of ideal magnetohydrodyamics and consider axisymmetric solutions. In all cases, the black hole is assumed to be moving with fixed velocity through a fluid which has constant pressure and density at large distances. Because all of the simulated flows are highly nonlinear and supersonic, we use modern computational techniques capable of accurately dealing with extreme solution features such as shocks. In the axisymmetric ultrarelativistic case, we show that the accretion is described by steady-state solutions characterized by well-defined accretion rates which we compute, and are in reasonable agreement with previously reported results by Font and collaborators [1,2,3]. However, in contrast to this earlier work with moderate energy densities, where the computed solutions always had tail shocks, we find parameter settings for which the time-independent solutions contain bow shocks. For the ultrarelativistic thin-disk models, we find steady-state configurations with specific accretion rates and observe that the flows simultaneously develop both a tail shock and a bow shock. For the case of axisymmetric accretion using a magnetohydrodynamic perfect fluid, we align the magnetic field with the axis of symmetry. Preliminary results suggest that the resulting flows remain time-dependent at late times, although we cannot conclusively rule out the existence of steady-state solutions. Moreover, the flow morphology is different in the magnetic case: additional features are apparent that include an evacuated region near the symmetry axis and close to the black hole.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Thermo-viscous fingering in porous media and in-situ soil remediation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Moyles, Iain</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The removal of artificially and naturally placed oils found in the ground is of paramount concern for environmental reasons and for the extraction of crude oil for energy. While many companies are involved in this soil remediation process, the physics of the underlying problem are not very well understood. We present a mathematical model and analysis of oil extraction in a porous soil based around the injection of water. We first consider a saturation analysis based on conservation of mass between oil and water in a one-dimensional setting and we find that based on certain parameter values, the water-oil interface goes unstable producing viscous finger patterns. We then include the effects of surface tension between oil and water to determine how this affects the growth of such fingers. We conclude that in the limit of small surface tension effects, the results generalize to the original problem, but more importantly, we deduce that there is a scaling which places the formulation into a setting that is invariant with respect to the magnitude of surface tension effects. With this scaling, we notice that the effect of surface tension is to limit the growth of fingers to a maximal wave number and to prevent their formation entirely beyond a certain critical wave number. Finally with the inclusion of temperature, via heated water injection, we see the formation of a dual fingering pattern: one associated with the mass conservation analysis of the oil-water interface and one associated with the conservation of energy across an interface where thermal gradients occur. We see that the thermal gradients across the interface where temperature drops induce unstable viscous patterns with a higher wave number than would occur for an equivalent isothermal interface where there was solely a change in viscosity. The thermal gradients also promote fingering development downstream across the classical viscosity differential driven interface but at the expense of lowering the interfacial velocity. It is interesting to note that the change in saturation that occurs across the energy interface is a result of a pseudo-free boundary created by the thermal problem.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>In-plane stress analysis using tensor field photoelasticity</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gao, Sui</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Few experimental methods exist for evaluating all in-plane stress components in solid materials; because of the tensor nature of these quantities. Full field measurement of all three stress components is desirable, since plastic deformation or failure can result from any combination of the three. A new photoelastic stress measurement method is presented for evaluating all three in-plane stress components within a two-dimensional photoelastic material. The measurement method is based on the observation that the complex transmission factors that describe the optical phase changes due to stress-induced birefringence have a second order tensor character, similar to that of other tensor quantities such as stress and strain. The same transformation equations and Mohr’s circle construction can be applied to the rotation of optical axis. A Michelson type interferometer and phase shifting are used to quantify the phases of the complex transmission factors. Mohr’s circle calculation is applied to obtain the principal transmission factors and principal axis orientation. The principal stresses are then obtained from the principal transmission factors through the stresss optical relationship. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated by comparing the experimental and analytical results for a hollow circular ring under diametric compression.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Computational plenoptic image acquisition and display</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wetzstein, Gordon</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Recent advances in camera technology, computing hardware, and optical fabrication have led to the emergence of computational photography, a field exploring the joint design of optical light modulation and computational processing. While conventional cameras record two-dimensional images, the "ultimate" computational camera would capture all visual information with a single shot. The amount of control over such high-dimensional data is unprecedented: dynamic range, depth of field, focus, colour gamut, and time scale of a photograph can be interactively controlled in post-processing. Required visual properties include the colour spectrum as well as spatial, temporal, and directional light variation - the plenoptic function. Unfortunately, digital sensors optically integrate over the plenoptic dimensions; most of the desired information is irreversibly lost in the process. We explore the multiplexed acquisition of the plenoptic function in this thesis. For this purpose, we introduce a mathematical framework that models plenoptic light modulation and corresponding computational processing. This framework not only allows us to evaluate and optimize the optical components of computational cameras, but also subsequent reconstructions. The combined design of optical modulation and computational processing is not only useful for photography, displays benefit from similar ideas. Within this scope, we propose multi-layer architectures and corresponding optimization schemes for glasses-free 3D display. Compared to conventional automultiscopic displays, our devices optimize brightness, resolution, and depth of field while preserving thin form factors. In a different application, adaptive coded apertures are introduced to projection displays as next-generation auto-iris systems. Combined with computational processing that exploits limitations of human perception, these systems increase the depth of field and temporal contrast of conventional projectors. With computational optics, integrated into sunglasses or car windshields, the capabilities of the human visual system can be extended. By optically modulating perceived intensities and colours, we demonstrate applications to contrast manipulation, preattentive object detection, and visual aids for the colour blind. Finally, we introduce computational probes as high-dimensional displays designed for computer vision applications, rather than for direct view. These probes optically encode refraction caused by transparent phenomena into observable changes in colour and intensity. Novel coding schemes enable single-shot reconstructions of transparent, refractive objects.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Polaron physics beyond the Holstein model</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Marchand, Dominic</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Many condensed matter problems involve a particle coupled to its environment. The polaron, originally introduced to describe electrons in a polarizable medium, describes a particle coupled to a bosonic field. The Holstein polaron model, although simple, including only optical Einstein phonons and an interaction that couples them to the electron density, captures almost all of the standard polaronic properties. We herein investigate polarons that differ significantly from this behaviour. We study a model with phonon-modulated hopping, and find a radically different behaviour at strong couplings. We report a sharp transition, not a crossover, with a diverging effective mass at the critical coupling. We also look at a model with acoustic phonons, away from the perturbative limit, and again discover unusual polaron properties. Our work relies on the Bold Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (BDMC) method, which samples Feynman diagrammatic expansions efficiently, even those with weak sign problems. Proposed by Prokof'ev and Svistunov, it is extended to lattice polarons for the first time here. We also use the Momentum Average (MA) approximation, an analytical method proposed by Berciu, and find an excellent agreement with the BDMC results. A novel MA approximation able to treat dispersive phonons is also presented, along with a new exact solution for finite systems, inspired by the same formalism.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Spin effects in quantum point contacts</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ren, Yuan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Quantum point contacts (QPCs) are narrow constrictions between large reservoirs of two-dimensional electron gas, with conductance quantized in units of G=2e²/h at zero magnetic field. Despite decades of investigation, some conductance features of QPCs remain mysterious, such as an extra conductance plateau at 0.7(2e²/h) (0.7 structure) and a zero-bias peak (ZBP) in nonlinear conductance. In this thesis, we present experimental studies of transport anomalies in QPCs, aiming at shedding more light on these features. Conductance measurements are performed for ZBPs in a much wider range than in most previous work, focused especially on the low- and high-conductance regimes. The Kondo model and a model of subband motion are compared with experimental results, but both of them fall short of explaining the data. The subband-motion model is not spin-dependent, so it conflicts with the spin-related nature of ZBPs as confirmed by measurements of nuclear spin polarization in QPCs in an in-plane magnetic field. However, the motion of subbands and the spin dependence of these motions are clearly shown by thermopower spectroscopy. These results may help understand the origin of ZBPs and 0.7 structure.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>PIV measurements of flow through forming fabrics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Peng, Haiya</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Three-dimensional velocity fields in the single phase approach flow to a multiple layer woven forming fabric were measured using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The measurements were conducted on a scale model of a forming fabric in a water/glycerin flow loop. Each strand on the paper side of the model forming fabric had a filament diameter around 15.4mm, and the loop test section was 310mm squared, permitting the measurement of detailed velocity distributions over multiple strands of the fabric. The flow speed in the loop test section were varied to achieve screen Reynolds numbers (Res), calculated based on paper side filament diameter (d), between 15 and 65. PIV measurements showed that the normalized ZD velocity deviation decreases from 19.7% at a plane 0.25d upstream from the forming fabric to 4.2% at a plane 1.5d upstream. The normalized CMD velocity deviation decreases from 15.3% at a plane 0.25d upstream from the forming fabric to 1.9% at a plane 1.5d upstream. The normalized MD velocity deviation decreases from 14.5% at a plane 0.25d upstream from the forming fabric to 2.3% at a plane 1.5d upstream. The highest ZD velocity is about 3.3 times higher than the lowest ZD velocity at a plane 0.25d above the fabric. This ratio decreases to 1.2 at a plane 1.5d above the fabric. These findings show that the flow non-uniformity caused by the fabric weave is restrained to a short distance above the fabric. However, even this non-uniformity is not particularly felt by fibers, whose length scale results in an averaging of the local velocity field. CFD simulations of the same flow were consistent with the PIV measurements.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Silicon ring resonator add-drop multiplexers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Boeck, Robert</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides have become an attractive area of research to decrease the footprint of optical interconnects as well as to ensure high speed data transmission. Specifically, research into using SOI ring resonator add-drop filters for WDM applications have been increasingly pursued. A ring resonator coupled on both sides by straight waveguides enables one to add (multiplex) or drop (demultiplex) wavelengths. Using series-coupled ring resonators, with each resonator having a different length, enables better spectral performance than single ring resonators. In this thesis, we have analyzed the properties of SOI strip waveguides and directional couplers. We have compared different spectral properties of single and series-coupled ring resonators and showed the advantages of using series-coupled ring resonators. SOI strip waveguide series-coupled racetrack resonators exhibiting the Vernier effect were designed by us and fabricated at a leading edge foundry. The free spectral range was 36 nm, which is comparable to the span of the optical C-band. The drop port response showed interstitial peak suppression between 9 dB and 17 dB and minimal resonance splitting.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Monolithic integration of AlGaAs distributed Bragg reflectors on virtual Ge substrates via aspect ratio trapping</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lin, Yiheng</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Over the past two decades, researchers have devoted great efforts on Si photonics to overcome the communication bottleneck of integrated circuits. In order to realize short-reach optical interconnects, excellent performance has been achieved so far on waveguides, modulators and detectors, which use Si compatible materials (e.g. SiO₂, Si₃N₄ and SiGe) and processes. However, lasers on Si have been much more difficult to implement. Monolithically integrated vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) on Si platforms are a suitable choice as output devices on Si, and is the long-term goal of this project. The research for this thesis work chose Ge/Si ART (aspect ratio trapping) substrates as the Si platform to overcome the material mismatch between AlGaAs/GaAs system and Si, and investigated the first and crucial step of successful VCSEL integration on Si platforms, which is the VCSEL distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) growth and characterization on Ge/Si ART substrates. Three types of samples were grown and characterized to reveal the quality of DBRs and ART substrates. The results show good quality and potential for high performance VCSEL. The ART-based DBRs have reflectance spectra comparable to those grown on conventional bulk GaAs substrates and have smooth morphology. High-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) rocking curves show that the residual stress and crystal quality of the Ge films depend on oxide trench patterns. Though GaAs-DBRs have sharper satellite peaks, ART-DBRs also show good structural quality, considering the effect of more complex substrate structure with SiO₂, Ge and strained-Ge. The main peaks’ full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of ART-DBR are about twice as GaAs-DBR’s. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal very good periodicity and uniformity that are unaffected by threading dislocations or residual strain. These results are very encouraging for the successful full VCSEL growth on these substrates and also confirm that virtual Ge substrates via the ART technique are effective Si platforms for optoelectronic integrated circuits.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in sheared density stratified flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rahmani, Mona</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are the most commonly studied type of instability in sheared density stratified flows. Turbulence caused by these instabilities is an important mechanism for mixing in geophysical flows. The primary objectives of this study are the evolution of these instabilities and quantifying the mixing they generate using direct numerical simulations. The results are presented in three chapters. First, the evolution of primary Kelvin-Helmhlotz instabilities in two dimensions is studied for a wide range of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, representing real oceanic and atmospheric flows. The results suggest that some properties of KH billows are predictable by a semi-analytical model. It is shown that a new Corcos-Sherman scale is a useful guide when simulating turbulent KH flow fields. The details of the mixing process generated by the evolution of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities as it goes through different stages, is analyzed. As the Reynolds number increases a transition in the overall amount of mixing is found, which is in agreement with previous experimental studies. This transition is explained quantitatively by the entrainment and mixing caused by three-dimensional motions, in addition to those resulted from the two-dimensional growth of the instability. The effect of Prandtl number on mixing is studied to understand the characteristics of high Prandtl number mixing events in the ocean; these cases have usually been approximated by low Prandtl number simulations. The increase in the Pradtl number has some significant implications for the evolution of the billow, the time variation of mixing properties, and the overall mixing.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Characterization of photonic crystal silicon-on-insulator optical circuits fabricated by a CMOS foundry</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Schelew, Ellen N.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Prototype silicon photonic circuits in a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer fabricated using a CMOS-based single layer process, are thoroughly characterized. Thousands of devices were fabricated on a single 200 mm diameter wafer using deep UV lithography at the IMEC silicon photonics foundry. The devices studied integrate three key elements: i) input/output grating couplers, ii) waveguides, and iii) microcavities. The photonic crystal cavities are symmetrically coupled to input and output single mode channel waveguides, which couple light into tapered waveguides that are terminated by two-dimensional photonic crystal gratings couplers. The grating coupler efficiencies and bandwidths are studied independently from the other device components, both experimentally and by simulations, using free-space optics. At a fixed angle of incidence, light over a bandwidth of approximately 14 nm (TE) and 30 nm (TM) is coupled from grating to grating, in both experiments and simulations. The centre frequency of this coupling spectrum is tuned by varying the angle of incidence on the grating, by coating the grating with photoresist, and by varying the size of the holes that form the grating. The maximum net single-grating coupling efficiencies are measured to be 15% (26%) for TE (TM) coupling. Taking into account the limited aperture of the collection optics, and aberrations of the input coupling lenses, these measured net efficiencies are reasonably consistent with simulated true efficiencies of 21%(49%) found using Lumerical FDTD Solutions and MODE Solutions commercial software. Resonant transmission measurements from free space, via an input grating, through the complete integrated photonic circuit, including the photonic crystal microcavity, and off-chip via an output grating are measured for a number of different cavities. The transmission of light from the end of one tapered waveguide, through the cavity, to the end of the other tapered waveguide is found to be ~10%. The maximum microcavity quality factor measured is ~ 5000. This work demonstrates that fully integrated photonic circuits can be successfully fabricated using IMEC's CMOS foundry service. It further shows that useful overall coupling efficiencies can be realized using free space optics, which will be useful for probing such circuits when they are placed inside optical cryostats.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Bench-scale two-dimensional fluidized bed hydrodynamics and struvite growth studies</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Qu, Xiaocao</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A bench-scale, two-dimensional multi-compartmentalized fluidized reactor was designed and studies of hydrodynamic behavior of fluidization of struvite pellets were performed. Also size growth distribution tests were analyzed qualitatively. The study validated a previously-proposed theory, concerning the relationship between dynamic pressure drop and upflow velocity as well the experimental protocol to determine the minimum fluidization velocity. Findings indicated that the mixture of two-sized particles would behave rather independently of each other, before the bed expansion. It was suggested that bed height measurement could be another promising method to pinpoint minimum fluidization velocity as there is a sharp bed surface "waking episode" during the process of a packed bed being gradually fluidized. Bed expansion equations for the prediction of void fraction as a function of superficial upflow velocity or vice versa, have been established for 4 groups of monosize particles, as well as two mixtures of two-sized particles. The equation constants did not agree well with previously established ones. The two layers of segregated mixture bed had congruent linear relationships between the logarithmic void fraction and logarithmic upflow velocity. It was found that a mixture does not always go through segregation, but only when the size difference is large enough. Size growth distribution tests were performed under different hydrodynamic configurations as well as seeding conditions. Conclusions can be made that a bed with uniformly- distributed particle void fractions and higher mixing energy input (upflow velocity), normally has better performance of struvite growth in size.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>From displacement to mixing in a slightly inclined duct</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Taghavi, Seyed Mohammad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis studies buoyant displacement flows with two miscible fluids in pipes and 2D channels that are inclined at angles (β) close to horizontal. Detailed experimental, analytical and computational approaches are employed in an integrated fashion. The displacements are at low Atwood numbers and high Péclet numbers, so that miscibility effects are mostly observable after instability and via dispersive mixing. For iso-viscous Newtonian displacements, studying the front velocity variation as a function of the imposed flow velocity allows us to identify 3 distinct flow regimes: an exchange flow dominated regime characterized by Kelvin-Helmholtz-like instabilities, a laminarised viscous displacement regime with the front velocity linearly increasing with the mean imposed flow rate, and a fully mixed displacement regime. The transition between the first and the second regimes is found to be marked by a stationary layer of displaced fluid. In the stationary layer the displaced fluid moves in counter-current motion with zero net volumetric flux. Different lubrication/thin-film models have been used to predict the flow behaviour. We also succeed in characterising displacements as viscous or inertial, according to the absence/presence of interfacial instability and mixing. This dual characterisation allows us to define 5-6 distinct flow regimes, which we show collapse onto regions in the two-dimensional (Fr, Re cosβ/Fr)-plane. Here Fr is the densimetric Froude number and Re the Reynolds number. In each regime we have been able to offer a leading order approximation to the leading front velocity. A weighted residual method has also been used to include the effect of inertia within the lubrication modelling approach, which allows us to predict long-wave instabilities. We have extended the study to include the effects of moderate viscosity ratio and shear-thinning fluids. We see many qualitative similarities with the iso-viscous studies. Predictive models are proposed (and compared with experiments and simulations) for the viscous and inertial regimes. Having a significant yield stress in the displaced fluid leads to completely new phenomena. We identify two distinct flow regimes: a central-type displacement regime and a slump-type regime for higher density differences. In both regimes, the displaced fluid can remain completely static in residual wall layers.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Michel electrons analysis in the fine-grained detectors for T2K</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kim, Jiae</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Over the decades, neutrino physics has advanced remarkably. Confirmation of neutrino oscillation is one of the important results. It indicates that neutrinos have non-zero mass and flavor mixing. T2K is an experiment designed to observe neutrino oscillations. It is an accelerator-based experiment with a baseline of 295 km across Japan from Tokai to Kamioka. The accelerator and the near detector are at Tokai and the far detector is at Kamioka. The near detector characterizes neutrino interactions in the absence of oscillation effects. Fine-Grained Detectors (FGDs) are a part of the near detector, which provide target mass and track particles emerging from neutrino interactions occurring in the detector. The primary neutrino interaction channel mode of interest is the charged-current quasi-elastic (CCQE) interaction. In CCQE interactions, a charged-lepton and a proton are in the final state. The neutrino energy is reconstructed and its flavor is identified by the charged lepton. Other, non-CCQE neutrino interactions have another particles in the final state such as pions. The pions may stop in an FGD and decay to produce muons, which in turn stop and decay to produce electrons. The electrons from muon decay at rest are called Michel electrons. Michel electrons are a powerful tool to distinguish CCQE and non-CCQE interactions. This thesis describes the studies of Michel electron activity in the near detector using cosmic rays.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Intracavity generation of high order harmonics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hammond, Thomas John</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The goal of this work is the generation of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from a laser based source. To this end, we use high harmonic generation (HHG) to convert the near infrared output of a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser oscillator to the EUV. The requirement for HHG is a high peak intensity (&gt;10¹³ W/cm²), which can be met by external amplification of the laser output. The method of amplification chosen for this work is a femtosecond enhancement cavity (fsEC), which stores and amplifies the output of a femtosecond mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser by greater than a factor of 900 while maintaining the original repetition rate of 66 MHz. The design, benefits, and limitations of using a fsEC are discussed. The EUV light is created by the interaction of the amplified light with xenon gas delivered to the fsEC focus. The strong intracavity field leads to xenon plasma generation with detrimental effects on the HHG process, where it is shown that HHG is sensitive to the xenon gas and plasma dynamics. Methods of minimizing the plasma density and maximizing the EUV amplitude are discussed. The EUV is coupled out of the cavity, and up to the thirteenth harmonic (61 nm) of the laser is observed. The relative amplitudes of the different quantum trajectories generating the harmonics are calculated theoretically, and compared to experiment. The generated power of the eleventh harmonic (72 nm) is estimated to be 30μW, with a measured outcoupled power of 1.1μW. The relative intensity noise is also measured, with a cumulative root-mean-square (RMS) noise of &lt;1.2% over 100 Hz - 100 kHz bandwidth. In comparison to other laser based HHG systems, while the EUV flux is similar, the cumulative RMS noise is an order of magnitude lower.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Using low-energy ⁸Li beta-detected NMR to probe the magnetism of transition metals</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Parolin, Terry J.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Low-energy, beta-radiation-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) is applied to probe the magnetism of Au and Pd. The measurements were carried out at the TRIUMF β-NMR facility using optically spin-polarized ⁸Li⁺ as the probe. The behaviour of ⁸Li⁺+ in Au was investigated using samples in the form of a foil and a 100 nm film evaporated onto a MgO (100) substrate. The results are in overall agreement with those obtained previously in Ag, Cu, and Al. Narrow, temperature-independent resonances are observed and assigned to ions stopping in the octahedral interstitial and substitutional lattice sites; the latter appearing only for temperatures above 150 K which is attributed to a thermally-activated site change. The spin-lattice relaxation rate of substitutional site ions is less than half as fast at ambient temperature as that in the other simple metals. The rate is independent of external field for fields greater than 15 mT. A Korringa analysis for the substitutional ions indicates no significant electron enhancement over that of a free electron gas. For all four metals, the enhancements obtained are smaller than those for the host nuclei. No depth dependence was found for the resonances in Au. The highly exchange-enhanced metal Pd was studied using samples in the form of a foil and a 100 nm film evaporated onto a SrTiO₃ (100) substrate. Strongly temperature-dependent, negative shifts are observed that scale with the temperature dependence of the host susceptibility between room temperature and 110 K. The resonances appear as two partially resolved lines that exhibit similar behaviour with temperature. The linewidths are broad and double upon cooling. The data are indicative of ions stopping in a site of cubic symmetry. The spin-lattice relaxation rate increases linearly with increasing temperature and eventually saturates at higher temperatures, consistent with the prediction from spin fluctuation theory. In contrast to the simple metals, large Korringa enhancements are obtained in this host. Ferromagnetic dynamical scaling is observed to hold above 110 K. Features below this temperature indicate that the Li ions locally induce a further enhancement of the static susceptibility. The temperature dependence of the modified susceptibility is in keeping with the prediction for a weak itinerant ferromagnet just above the Curie temperature; however, there is no evidence of static order.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies of Tl₂Ba₂CuO₆+δ and YBa₂Cu₃O₇-δ : analysis of recent results and the construction of a new system</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mottershead, Jeffrey Daniel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results, from experiments performed at the Swiss Light Source, Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, and Advanced Light Source synchrotrons, on the high-temperature superconductors Tl₂Ba₂CuO₆+δ (Tl2201) and YBa₂Cu₃O (YBCO₆.₅) are presented. An overdoped Tl2201 sample with a TC of 30K was found to have a Fermi surface, consisting of a large hole pocket centred at (Pi ,Pi ), which is approaching a topological transition. A superconducting gap consistent with a dχ₂−y₂ order parameter was detected. In contrast with the underdoped HTSCs, where the quasiparticle (QP) linewidth at the top of the band is maximal in the antinodal direction and minimal in the nodal direction, overdoped Tl2201 was revealed to have a reverse nodal-antinodal anisotropy, with sharp QP peaks in the antinodal region and broader peaks in the nodal region. The Tl2201 results establish Tl2201 as a valuable material for exploring the overdoped side of the phase diagram with ARPES. Synchrotron experiments also yielded the first successful ARPES results on underdoped YBa₂Cu₃O₇−δ (YBCO). Surface-sensitive techniques were previously unsuccessful in studying YBCO because its cleaved surfaces are polar, resulting in an overdoped surface regardless of the doping level of the bulk. By doping the cleaved surfaces with potassium, the surface was progressively hole underdoped from as-cleaved continuously to the doping of the bulk, and subsequent ARPES experiments performed revealed a transition from a holelike Fermi surface on the as-cleaved surface to disconnected Fermi arcs when the surface doping matched the bulk. In parallel with the synchrotron-based research, an in-house ARPES system was constructed at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Unlike conventional ARPES systems, the ARPES setup at UBC incorporates a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system, which allows novel materials to be grown, characterized, and transferred to the ARPES chamber in vacuo. Novel design techniques to improve the accuracy of ARPES measurements are presented. The in-house ARPES system also serves as a prototype for an ARPES–MBE endstation being constructed at the Canadian Light Source (CLS). Design studies of some potential improvements to the in-house system, to be implemented at the CLS, are also presented.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Metal waveguides for multi-axial light guiding at nanometer scales</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Maqsood, Muhammad Waqas</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A basic component of most optical systems is an optical waveguide. There has been an increased interest in nanofabricated optical waveguides that incorporate metal layers due to their fabrication compatibility with existing complimentary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes and, their ability to sustain sub-wavelength confined electromagnetic modes. In this work, we have developed analytical techniques for designing metal waveguides that achieve tailored optical functionalities. The developed techniques are applied in two design examples which address contemporary problems related to waveguiding at sub-wavelength and nanometer scales.In the first example, we apply our analytical technique to optimize a bi-axial waveguide that can bend light at 90 degree, constructed from two uni-axial metal waveguides. The optimization procedure consists of mapping out wavevector values of the electromagnetic modes sustained by the two waveguides over the operational frequency range. The constituent materials and geometry of the waveguides are selected such that each waveguide sustains only one low-loss mode. The geometry of each of the waveguides is tailored in a way that the in-plane wavevector components for both waveguide modes are matched. The wavevector matching results in efficient coupling between the two modes, yielding predicted bending efficiencies over 90%. In the second example, we apply our analytical technique to optimize a bi-axial waveguide structure for coupling free-space light into surface plasmon polaritons (SPP), electromagnetic excitations bounded to the surface of a metal. We study the simple geometry consisting of a slit in a metal film, filled and covered with a dielectric. We break the configuration down into two uni-axial waveguide components. Using our approach, we optimize the materials and geometry of the slit so that wavevector matching is achieved between the light emanating from the slit and the adjacent SPP modes, yielding coupling efficiency over 68%.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electron transport in wide energy gap semiconductors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cheekoori, Reddiprasad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The dependence of the low-field electron drift mobility on the crystal temperature is determined for a number of wide energy gap semiconductors of interest. The materials considered include gallium nitride, aluminium nitride, indium nitride, and zinc oxide; while indium nitride is not a wide energy gap semiconductor in of itself, alloys of indium nitride with gallium nitride are. For the bulk results, it is found that indium nitride exhibits the highest low-field electron drift mobility while aluminium nitride exhibits the lowest low-field electron drift mobility. This is related to the small effective mass of electrons in indium nitride and the large effective mass of electrons in aluminium nitride. For the case of electrons confined within a two-dimensional electron gas, it is found that the low-field electron drift mobility exceeds that corresponding to the bulk material. This is due to the enhanced screening that electron concentrations exceeding the bulk ionized impurity concentrations level offer, i.e., surplus electrons act to further screen the ionized impurities; in a two-dimensional electron gas, the electron concentrations may far exceed those found in a bulk material. Recommendations for further study are suggested.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Classical and quantum nonlinear optics in confined photonic structures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ghafari Banaee, Mohamadreza</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Nonlinear optical phenomena associated with high-order soliton breakup in photonic crystal fibres and squeezed state generation in three dimensional photonic crystal microcavities are investigated. In both cases, the properties of periodically patterned, high-index contrast dielectric structures are engineered to control the dispersion and local field enhancements of the electromagnetic field. Ultra-short pulse propagation in a polarization-maintaining microstructured fibre (with 1 um core diameter and 1.1 m length) is investigated experimentally and theoretically. For an 80 MHz train of 130 fs pulses with average propagating powers in the fibre up to 13.8 mW, the output spectra consist of multiple discrete solitons that shift continuously to lower energies as they propagate in the lowest transverse mode of the fibre. The number of solitons and the amount that they shift both increase with the launched power. All of the data is quantitatively consistent with solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, but only when the Raman nonlinearity is treated without approximation, and self-steepening is included. The feasibility of using a parametric down-conversion process to generate squeezed electromagnetic states in 3D photonic crystal microcavity structures is investigated for the first time. The spectrum of the squeezed light is theoretically calculated by using an open cavity quantum mechanical formalism. The cavity communicates with two main channels, which model vertical radiation losses and coupling into a single-mode waveguide respectively. The amount of squeezing is determined by the correlation functions relating the field quadratures of light coupled into the waveguide. All of the relevant model parameters are realistically estimated using 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Squeezing up to ~20% below the shot noise level is predicted for reasonable optical excitation levels. To preserve the squeezed nature of the light generated in the microcavity, a unidirectional coupling geometry from the microcavity to a ridge waveguide in a slab photonic crystal structure is studied. The structure was successfully fabricated in a silicon membrane, and experimental measurements of the efficiency for the signal coupled out of the structure are in good agreement with the result of FDTD simulations. The coupling efficiency of the cavity mode to the output channel is ~60%.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Optofluidics for microscopy and sensing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chowdhury, Mohammad Faqrul Alam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Optofluidics describes a relatively new area of research that aims to synergistically combine optics and fluidics technologies. In this work, we examine the application and integration of small fluid volumes into two types of optical devices, yielding improvements in either tunability, flexibility, or cost-effectiveness. First, we explore a simple methodology to dispense and shape water droplets for use as the magnifying element in a microscope operating under either reflection-mode or transmission-mode illumination. A water droplet is created at the end of a syringe and then coated with a thin layer of silicone oil to mitigate evaporation. By applying mechanical pressure to the water droplet using a metal tip, the shape of the droplet is tuned to yield focusing properties amenable for microscopy. Images captured using the microscope demonstrate micron-scale resolution, variable magnification, and imaging quality comparable to that obtained by a conventional, laboratory-grade microscope. Next, we develop a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor that exploits the index matching and coating capabilities of fluids. Conventional SPR sensor are implemented using an external light source, optical components to polarize incident light and guide light to and from a metal surface, a coupling device (such as a prism) to convert free-space light into surface plasmons on a metal surface and back into free-space light, and a light detector. Here, we develop a new SPR device architecture by combining several optical components via index matching fluid, which eliminates the need for a prism and integrates light delivery, light polarization control, surface plasmon coupling onto a thin, flexible substrate. We experimentally characterize the SPR device and find good agreement between experimental reflectivity measurements and a theoretical reflectivity model based on transfer-matrix formalism. By developing these new methods to integrate fluids for both microscopy and optical sensing applications, this work provides results that highlight both the promise and challenges of creating optical systems based on fluids.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Growth and structure of yttrium sesquioxide epitaxial films</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Webster, Scott Elliott</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The use of molecular beam epitaxy as a method for producing solid state host crystals for planar waveguide lasers has been investigated. Single crystal yttrium sesquioxide with a very high degree of structural order has been grown on R-plane sapphire substrates. The (01Ῑ2) Al₂O₃ substrates were annealed in air at 1150°C to generate atomically smooth surfaces with parallel atomic steps. This process was important for maximizing structural quality and minimizing surface roughness of the grown Y₂O₃ ﬁlm. A critical-thickness-like phenomenon was discovered, where the Y₂O₃ would grow in regions with near structural perfection at the beginning of growth. In thicker ﬁlms, the x-ray diffraction peaks became wider, indicating less crystalline uniformity. The maximum equivalent “critical thickness” achieved was 7 nm for a ﬁlm grown at 800°C with a growth rate of 20 nm/hr. The highly ordered material may be present in one uniform layer or distributed in smaller regions throughout the thin ﬁlm. Y₂O₃ ﬁlms on Al₂O₃ were annealed in air at temperatures up to 1400°C to study interdiffusion. By analyzing x-ray diffraction measurements, we found that Al migrated from the substrate into the Y₂O₃ ﬁlm with an approximate activation energy for bulk diffusion of 3.0 eV. Diffusion on the Y₂O₃ surface was estimated to have an activation energy of (0.5 ± 0.3) eV from atomic force microscopy images. After annealing, the presence of Y₄Al₂O₉, YAlO₃, and Y₃Al₅O₁₂ phases was conﬁrmed using x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence measurements. Attempts were made to use molecular hydrogen gas and gallium as surfactants during growth to improve ﬁlm properties. No conclusive beneﬁt was observed. Y₂O₃ ﬁlm surface roughness was observed to increase roughly proportionally to the square root of ﬁlm thickness. A 600 nm thick waveguide layer grown under optimal conditions had a root-mean-square roughness of 5.8 nm. This level of roughness could cause scattering loss at the waveguide core-cladding interface that is problematic for practical applications.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Giant magnetoresistance and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic hybrid nanostructures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rizal, Conrad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Significant advances in the growth, measurement, and characterization methods in the field of nanoengineering have made Co-based magnetic hybrid (ferromagnetic and non-magnetic) nanostructures increasingly important for the development of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensors and high magnetic-moment biocompatible nanoparticles for use in the future magnetic technology. This thesis presents the growth, measurement, and characterization of magnetic hybrid nanostructures (multilayers, alloys, and nanoparticles) that exhibit interesting magnetoresistance (MR) and magnetic properties, which are significant in the development of state-of-the-art magnetic technology for use in the electronics and biomedical sectors. Firstly, Co/Au multilayers have been grown on glass substrates using e-beam evaporation, and then Co/Ag and Co/Cu multilayers have been grown on polyimide substrates using pulsed-current deposition. All of these multilayers exhibited the GMR effect at room temperature. The maximum MR for Co/Au, Co/Ag, and Co/Cu multilayers was 2.1 %, 9.1 %, and 4.1 %, respectively. The e-beam evaporated multilayers exhibited strong magnetic anisotropy when the films were deposited at the angle of 45 degrees. The electrodeposited multilayers exhibited strong magnetic anisotropy when strain was introduced externally. In both the cases, the GMR is strongly influenced by the ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layer thicknesses and interfacial states between layers. Secondly, novel nanocomposites Co nanoparticles embedded in Au matrix have been developed using pulsed-current deposition on polyimide substrates. They exhibited interesting MR, grain size, and saturation magnetization characteristics. The maximum room temperature GMR found was 4.6 %. X-ray diffraction, magnetization, and low temperature measurements suggest that a smaller grain size formed during higher current density correlates with the larger MR values for these nanocomposites. Thirdly, high-magnetic-moment biocompatible FeCo nanostructures have been developed using pulsed-current deposition. The nanostructures exhibited saturation magnetization of up to 240 emu/g, which is much larger than the saturation magnetization of either Co or Fe. The less expensive and highly sensitive GMR sensors if coated with specific probes, and if the target biomolecules are labelled with high-moment biocompatible nanoparticles presented in this thesis, the GMR sensors have potential for use in improving the early detection and treatment of chronic diseases (e.g., prostate and lung cancer) using biomagnetic technology.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Laser-induced electron emission from arrays of carbon nanotubes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yaghoobi, Parham</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Recently there has been growing interest in the interaction of light and nanomaterials, especially carbon nanotubes. Although there exist a large number of studies on the physical and chemical properties of nanotubes with various spectroscopic techniques, only a limited number of works have looked at this interaction for electron source applications. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates light-induced electron emission from arrays of nanotubes with a broad range of wavelengths and light intensities. I demonstrate that arrays of nanotubes have a quantum efficiency of &gt; 10-⁵ in the photoelectric regime, which is comparable to that of metal photocathodes such as copper. Nanotubes are also expected to have better operational lifetime than metals because of their complete chemical structure. I also demonstrate that, based on an effect called "Heat Trap", a spot on the surface of a nanotube array can be heated to above 2,000 K using a low-power beam of light with a broad range of wavelengths from ultraviolet to infrared. Light-induced heating of a typical bulk conductor to electron emission temperatures requires high-power lasers. This is because of the efficient dissipation of heat generated at the illuminated spot to the surroundings, since electrical conductors are also typically excellent thermal conductors. I show that the situation can be drastically different in an array of nanotubes. This behaviour has far-reaching implications for electron sources. For example, the fabrication cost of light-induced electron sources can be signicantly reduced since the nanotube-based cathode can be heated to thermionic emission temperatures with inexpensive, low-power, battery-operated handheld lasers as apposed to high-power or pulsed laser sources, which are currently required for metal cathodes. Arrays of nanotubes can also be shape engineered because of their sparse nature. I have demonstrated that the emission current density can be increased by a factor of 4 by densifying the array with a liquid-induced shrinkage that works by pulling the nanotubes closer together. The Implications of the findings reported in this thesis go beyond conventional electronbeam technologies. For instance, they could lead to novel devices such as thermionic solar cells, solar displays and new types of optical modulators and thermoelectrics.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Simulation of hydrodynamics of the jet impingement using Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Maghzian, Hamid</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Controlled cooling is an important part of steel production industry that affects the properties of the outcome steel. Many of the researches done in controlled cooling are experimental. Due to progress in the numerical techniques and high cost of experimental works in this field the numerical work seems more feasible. Heat transfer analysis is the necessary element of successful controlled cooling and ultimately achievement of novel properties in steel. Heat transfer on the surface of the plate normally contains different regimes such as film boiling, nucleate boiling, transition boiling and radiation heat transfer. This makes the analysis more complicated. In order to perform the heat transfer analysis often empirical correlations are being used. In these correlations the velocity and pressure within the fluid domain is involved. Therefore in order to obtain a better understanding of heat transfer process, study of hydrodynamics of the fluid becomes necessary. Circular jet due to its high efficiency has been used vastly in the industry. Although some experimental studies of round jet arrays have been done, yet the characteristics of a single jet with industrial geometric and flow parameters on the surface of a flat plate is not fully understood. Study of hydrodynamics of the jet impingement is the first step to achieve better understanding of heat transfer process. Finite element method as a popular numerical method has been used vastly to simulate different domains. Traditional approaches of finite element method, Lagrangian and Eulerian, each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Lagrangian approach has been used widely in solid domains and Eulerian approach has been widely used in fluid fields. Jet impingement problem, due to its unknown free surface and the change in the boundary, falls in the category of special problems and none of the traditional approaches is suitable for this application. The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation has emerged as a technique that can alleviate many of the shortcomings of the traditional Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations in handling these types of problems. Using the ALE formulation the computational grid need not adhere to the material (Lagrangian) nor be fixed in space (Eulerian) but can be moved arbitrarily. Two distinct techniques are being used to implement the ALE formulation, namely the operator split approach and the fully coupled approach. This thesis presents a fully coupled ALE formulation for the simulation of flow field. ALE form of Navier-Stokes equations are derived from the basic principles of continuum mechanics and conservation laws in the fluid. These formulations are then converted in to ALE finite element equations for the fluid flow. The axi-symmetric form of these equations are then derived in order to be used for jet impingement application. In the ALE Formulation as the mesh or the computational grid can move independent of the material and space, an additional set of unknowns representing mesh movement appears in the equations. Prescribing a mesh motion scheme in order to define these unknowns is problem-dependent and has not been yet generalized for all applications. After investigating different methods, the Winslow method is chosen for jet impingement application. This method is based on adding a specific set of partial differential Equations(Laplace equations) to the existing equations in order to obtain enough equations for the unknowns. Then these set of PDEs are converted to finite element equations and derived in axi-symmetric form to be used in jet impingement application. These equations together with the field equations are then applied to jet impingement problem. Due to the number of equations and nonlinearity of the field equations the solution of the problem faces some challenges in terms of convergence characteristics and modeling strategies. Some suggestions are made to deal with these challenges and convergence problems. Finally the numerical treatment and results of analyzing hydrodynamics of the Jet Impingement is presented. The work in this thesis is confined to the numerical simulation of the jet impingement and the specifications of an industrial test setup only have been used in order to obtain the parameters of the numerical model.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental and computational study of mixing behavior in stirred tanks equipped with side entry impellers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sossa, Jaime Alberto</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The wide applicability of mechanically stirred tanks in industry demands a comprehensive understanding of the physical and chemical phenomena controlling the performance of these fundamental units. The rheological complexity of some industrial fluids can create unfavorable mixing environments like dead zones that limit the contact area among the components being mixed. Also, the complex three dimensional nature of the flow generated by the impellers makes difficult the prediction of the flow properties, especially when the fluid viscosity is a function of the shear rate. Some research groups have investigated mixing flow of these kinds of fluids in conventional stirred tanks with top-entry impellers. But, little has been done to characterize the flow behavior in tanks with side-entry impellers. In order to improve our understanding and provide insight into the flow mixing occurring in stirred tanks with side entry impellers, the flow field generated by different impellers in scale-down vessels filled with glycerine and carbopol solutions, was studied using the flow visualization technique, particle image velocimetry (PIV). Moreover, a computational model was built to predict flow variables and mixing characteristics unattainable with the experimental technique. The capabilities of the model were evaluated based on the velocity fields obtained experimentally. Good agreement was found between the predicted and measured macroscale flow structures and global mixing parameters. However, the models were unable to predict the symmetric flow observed during the experiments at high rotational speeds, likely due to the approach taken to simulate the flow, which provides a steady state velocity profile for one specific impeller location Overall the results showed the formation of dead zones and segregated regions when mixing the non-Newtonian solutions. The size of the dynamic regions and the average velocity near the impeller were improved by increasing the suction area. Likewise, large pitch ratios were found to enhance the active mixing zone and the axial discharge. While, radial discharge and a strong tangential flow arose when the viscous forces dominate the flow. In conclusion, the flow features were defined by the Reynolds number in the vicinity of the impeller and the restrictions imposed by the walls of the vessel.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A particle-based model for computing fluid flows and cell dynamics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hosseini Amin, Seyed Majid</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The connection between certain human diseases and changes in the mechanical properties of living cells is well established, e.g. in the cases of malaria and cancer. However, the mechanism for the mechanical modifications, which tend to facilitate the pathogenesis of such diseases, is not always clear. For instance, the overall loss of deformability of malaria-infected red blood cells (RBCs) corresponds to a 10-fold increase in the rigidity of the cell membrane. On the other hand, micropipette aspiration has only measured a 3-fold increase in the elastic modulus. In this thesis, a particle-based model is developed to explore the interplay between the underlying microstructures and the behavior of the cell as a whole. The research consists of three related projects. The first project deals with the long-standing problem of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method with open boundaries and solid walls. We propose a "rotational pressure-correction scheme" with a consistent pressure boundary condition that leads to a large improvement in accuracy of calculated pressure and the drag coefficient on solid obstacles. The second and third projects concern developing a 2D and then 3D particle-based model for RBCs to explore the parasite-driven changes in malaria-infected RBCs. In our models the cell membrane is replaced by a set of discrete particles connected by linear or nonlinear springs. In addition, a linear bending elasticity is implemented using the deviation of the local curvature from the innate curvature of the biconcave shape of a resting RBC. The cytoplasm and the external liquid are modelled as homogeneous Newtonian fluids, and discretized by particles as in standard SPH solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. The malaria parasite is modelled as an aggregate of particles constrained to rigid-body motion. We argue that the discrepancy in the estimated elastic modulus of the membrane is caused by the presence of the rigid parasite particles inside infected cells, and have carried out numerical simulations to demonstrate this mechanism. Our three-dimensional simulation of RBC stretching tests by optical tweezers accurately demonstrates the compensating effects between the existence of malaria parasites and the elevated stiffness of the membrane on the overall deformability of infected RBC.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The pion branching ratio (R^π = [formula omitted] ) is an auspicious observable for a test of the standard model of particle physics (SM). Rπ has been calculated within this framework with high precision because the strong interaction dynamics cancel out in the ratio and the structure dependence only appears through electroweak corrections. Since the discovery of the electronic pion decay in 1958, Rπ was measured with increasing precision and confirmed the SM value of RπSM = 1.2352(2) x 10⁻⁴. However, the current experimental precision is 20 times worse than the theoretical one leaving a large window for potential new physics at “high-mass" scales (up to ∽1000 TeV). The PIENU experiment aims at measuring Rπ with an improved precision by a factor larger than 5 over the previous experiment at TRIUMF (Rπexp = (1.2265 ± 0:0056) x 10⁻⁴) in order to confront the theoretical prediction at the 0.1% level. The result presented in this thesis focuses on a fraction of the data taken since the beginning of physics data taking in 2009. A blind analysis has been implemented in order to avoid a human bias. With this set of data, the procedure is established for the final analysis. An improvement by a factor 1.17, dominated by statistical uncertainty, has been reached in the branching ratio precision. If added to the current Particle Data Group value, the result of this analysis reduces the uncertainty on the branching ratio by ∽25%.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>First mass measurements of highly charged, short-lived nuclides in a Penning trap and the mass of Rb-74</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ettenauer, Stephan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>To date, Vud of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix is most precisely determined from superallowed 0⁺ → 0⁺ nuclear β-decays. In addition to half-life, Branching Ratio, and transition energy (called Q_EC-value) of a superallowed decay, theoretical corrections have to be considered to extract Vud. Among those, the isospin symmetry breaking corrections, δC , show discrepancies between different theoretical models, which are critical to be resolved. ⁷⁴Rb has the largest δC of all 13 superallowed β-emitters used to obtain Vud and would carry particular weight to discriminate between models were it not limited by the uncertainty in the Q_EC-value. However, ⁷⁴Rb’s half-life of 65 ms has previously posed a real challenge to the experimental precision in its Q_EC -value, which is best determined by direct mass measurements in Penning traps. In this work, Penning trap mass measurements of short-lived nuclides have been performed for the first time with highly-charged ions, using the TITAN facility. Compared to singly-charged ions, this provides an improvement in experimental precision that scales with the charge state q. Neutron-deficient Rb-isotopes have been prepared in an electron beam ion trap to q = 8 − 12+ prior to the mass measurements. In combination with a Ramsey scheme, this opens the door to unrivalled precision with gains of 1-2 orders of magnitude. The method is particularly suited for short-lived nuclides such as ⁷⁴Rb and its mass has been determined. In the realm of fundamental symmetries studied in low-energy nuclear systems such as in ⁷⁴Rb, the precision achieved by highly-charged ions is essential. For mass measurements motivated by nuclear structure or nuclear astrophysics, where the present experimental precision is already sufficient, this novel technique significantly reduces the measurement time and thus allows one to map the nuclear mass landscape more broadly. In the exploration towards the limits of nuclear existence where experimental efforts typically face shorter half-lives and lower production yields of radioisotopes, the same precision can be achieved by compensating for both challenges with the higher charge state. Finally, highly-charged ions provide opportunities for an unprecedented resolving power to identify low-lying nuclear isomers. This potential has firstly been demonstrated with ⁷⁸,⁷⁸mRbq⁼⁸⁺.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Emergence and stability of Majorana fermions in proximity-coupled topological insulator nanowires</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cook, Ashley M.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A finite-length topological insulator nanowire, proximity-coupled to an ordinary bulk s-wave superconductor and subject to a longitudinal applied magnetic field is shown to realize a one-dimensional topological superconductor with an unpaired Majorana fermion localized at each end of the nanowire. Here we also show that the unpaired Majorana fermions persist in this system for any value of the chemical potential inside the bulk band gap of order 300 meV in Bi₂Se₃ by computing the Majorana number. From this calculation, we also show that the unpaired Majorana fermions persist when the magnetic flux through the nanowire cross-section deviates significantly from half flux quantum. Lastly, we demonstrate that the unpaired Majorana fermions persist in strongly disordered wires with fluctuations in the on-site potential ranging in magnitude up to the size of the bulk band gap. These results suggest this solid-state system should exhibit unpaired Majorana fermions under accessible conditions likely important for experimental study or future applications.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Curve-counting invariants and crepant resolutions of Calabi-Yau threefolds</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Steinberg, David Christopher</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The Donaldson-Thomas (DT) theory of a Calabi-Yau threefold X gives rise to subtle deformation invariants. They are considered to be the mathematical counterparts of BPS state counts in topological string theory compactified on X. Principles of physics indicate that the string theory of a singular Calabi-Yau threefold and that of its crepant resolution ought to be equivalent, so one might expect that the DT theory of a singular Calabi-Yau threefold ought to be equivalent to that of its crepant resolution. There is some difficulty in defining DT when X is singular, but Bryan, Cadman, and Young have (in some generality) defined DT theory in the case where X is the coarse moduli space of an orbifold χ. The crepant resolution conjecture of Bryan-Cadman-Young gives a formula determining the DT invariants of the orbifold in terms of the DT invariants of the crepant resolution. In this dissertation, we begin a program to prove the crepant resolution conjecture using Hall algebra techniques inspired by those of Bridgeland.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical simulation of turbulent premixed flames with conditional source-term estimation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Salehi, Mohammad Mahdi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) is a closure model for turbulence-chemistry interactions. This model is based on the conditional moment closure hypothesis for the chemical reaction source terms. The conditional scalar field is estimated by solving an integral equation using inverse methods. CSE was originally developed for - and has been used extensively in - non-premixed combustion. This work is the first application of this combustion model to predictive simulations of turbulent premixed flames. The underlying inverse problem is diagnosed with rigorous mathematical tools. CSE is coupled with a Trajectory Generated Low-Dimensional Manifold (TGLDM) model for chemistry. The CSE-TGLDM combustion model is used with both Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence models to simulate two different turbulent premixed flames. Also in this work, the Presumed Conditional Moment (PCM) turbulent combustion model is employed. This is a simple flamelet model which is used with the Flame Prolongation of ILDM (FPI) chemistry reduction technique. The PCM-FPI approach requires a presumption for the shape of the probability density function of reaction progress variable. Two shapes have been examined: the widely used beta-function and the Modified Laminar Flamelet PDF (MLF-PDF). This model is used in both RANS and large-eddy simulation of a turbulent premixed Bunsen burner. Radial distributions of the calculated temperature field, axial velocity and chemical species mass fraction have been compared with experimental data. This comparison shows that using the MLF-PDF leads to predictions that are similar, and often superior to those obtained using the beta-PDF. Given that the new PDF is based on the actual chemistry - as opposed to the ad hoc nature of the beta-PDF - these results suggest that it is a better choice for the statistical description of the reaction progress variable.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Leveraging eigenvalue veering for improved sensing with microelectromechanical systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Reynen, Gregory Peter</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Energy localization in nearly periodic microsystems can be leveraged to create a new sensing paradigm that is orders of magnitude more sensitive than current resonant-frequency based systems. In this thesis, the theory which supports this claim is independently developed from a mathematical description of a two degree-of-freedom resonant system. A novel proof-of-concept microelectromechanical system (MEMS) was also designed and fabricated to support the theoretical claims. The system employed a unique resonator design with two different approaches to inducing asymmetry in the system which in turn leads to the localization of energy in one of the resonators. The system proved the resonant frequency dependence on disorder in the system and also showed that the eigenvector sensitivity to disorder was at least an order of magnitude greater than the frequency sensitivity. However, the eigenvector sensitivity could not be matched with theory. This was likely due to the time-varying nature of the coupling spring stiffness (up to a 300% change in magnitude). The coupling spring stiffness was time-varying due to the inverse cubic relationship to coupling gap distance. The gap distance changes with time since it is practically impossible to excite only the common mode, leading to a superposition with the anti-phase mode. This was partially due to the input signal displaying non harmonic tendencies. At the same time, energy localization in the system leads to different amplitudes of vibration for each resonator which will also lead to gap distance modulation. A three degree-of-freedom system was also examined theoretically with different approaches to stiffness perturbation and the resultant sensitivity expressions which can be leveraged for improved sensors were developed. The analysis shows that three degree-of-freedom systems can yield a 250% improvement over two degree-of-freedom systems which themselves are practically able to provide three to four order of magnitude improvements in sensitivity over resonant-frequency based sensors of the same size. The tools and insight needed to design for higher degree-of-freedom system are also provided in the form of the eigen-derivatives approach to calculating eigenvalue and eigenvector sensitivity to disorder in a symmetric system.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A study of topological insulators in two and three dimensions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Weeks, William Conan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this work we introduce a new model for a topological insulator in both two and three dimensions, and then discuss the possibility of creating a fractional topological insulator in the three dimensional version. We also explore the possibility of engineering a quantum spin Hall phase in Graphene through the application of heavy metal adatoms. We show that the two dimensional model on the Lieb lattice, and its three dimensional counterpart, the so called edge centered cubic or Perovskite lattice, possess non-trivial Z₂ invariants, and gapless edge modes, which are the signatures of the topological insulating state. Having established that these lattices can become topological insulators, we then tune several short range hoppings in the model and show that it is possible to flatten the lowest energy bands in each case. After flattening the bands we add in a Hubbard term and then use a mean field decoupling to show that there is a portion of phase space where the system remains non-magnetic, and then conjecture that the many body ground state in three dimensions could become a fractional topological insulator. For the model on graphene, we start by using density functional theory (DFT) to find a pair of suitable heavy elements that are non-magnetic, have a strong spin orbit coupling and prefer to sit at the center of the hexagonal lattice. We then establish that for adatoms distributed in a periodic configuration, again with DFT, that a gap will open at the Dirac point in the presence of spin orbit coupling. To prove the gap is topologically non-trivial, we show that it is possible to adiabatically connect this model to the original Kane-Mele model, a known topological insulator. Lastly, we show that for adatoms distributed randomly the effect survives.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Shubnikov-de Haas measurements and the spin magnetic moment of YBa₂Cu₃O₆.₅₉</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ramshaw, Brad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>High-temperature superconductivity (high-Tc) was discovered in 1986 in copper-oxide materials, and since that time the goal of understanding high-Tc has driven the advancement of theoretical and experimental condensed matter physics. Despite the concerted efforts of some of the brightest minds in physics over the past 26 years, there is still no microscopic understanding of these materials. One of the main problems is an uncertainty as to whether Fermi liquid theory, which has been the foundation of our understanding of conventional metals for over 50 years, can be used to describe the strange pseudo-metallic properties of the cuprates. This thesis studies the resistivity of the high-Tc superconductor YBa₂Cu₃O₆+x (YBCO) in magnetic fields up to 70 Tesla. These resistivity measurements show oscillatory behaviour as a function of magnetic field, which is a clear signature of a Fermi surface. The development of an advanced technique (based on a genetic algorithm) for analyzing the oscillatory resistance is presented, and the Fermi surface of YBa₂Cu₃O₆.₅₉ is determined with great precision by analyzing the field, angle, and temperature dependences of the oscillations. Analysis of the data shows that the electronic g factor, related to the strength of quasiparticle spin magnetic moment, does not experience strong renormalization in YBCO, in contrast with previous experimental studies. This lack of renormalization has important implications for theoretical descriptions of YBCO. A full description of the shape of the Fermi surface of YBCO is presented, and measurements of YBCO with different oxygen concentrations give the evolution of the Fermi surface with hole doping. A novel technique for fine-tuning the hole doping in YBCO is presented in the context of a Hall coefficient experiment. The result is a detailed doping dependence of the Hall coefficient, indicating that the Fermi surface seen in quantum oscillation experiments is influenced by some type of electronic order---such as charge and spin stripe order---competing with superconductivity near 1/8th hole doping. The behaviour of the superconducting vortex lattice in a magnetic field is analyzed as a function of temperature, and this behaviour also indicates that something is competing with superconductivity near 1/8th doping.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Control of atoms and molecules with shaped broadband pulses</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhdanovich, Sergey</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The main goal of this PhD work is an experimental study of coherent excitation of atomic and molecular wavepackets, i.e. superpositions of many quantum eigenstates, by shaped femtosecond pulses. Approaches allowing nearly complete population transfer between quantum eigenstates were well studied in the past within the two level approximation. In this work we focus on adiabatic and non-adiabatic methods of population transfer beyond the two-level approximation. Excitation of multi-level target states is possible due to broad spectrum of an ultrashort pulse which contains frequencies needed for multiple transitions to different states in the final superposition. At the same time, the spectrum of an ultrashort pulse can be modified, or ``shaped'', in order to affect the excitation process and control the amplitudes in the final superposition. Both non-adiabatic and quasi-adiabatic methods were first implemented and studied in electronic wavepackets in alkali atoms. The non-adiabatic approach revealed features linked to the strong-field perturbations of the energy level structure of the quantum system. An adiabatic method was implemented for the first time on a femtosecond time scale, and was thoroughly characterized. The control over complex amplitudes in the target superposition was demonstrated as well as completeness of the population transfer. In the second part of this work, we focused on coherent control of rotational wavepackets in diatomic molecules. Rotational excitation by a periodic train of femtosecond pulses was investigated in the context of ``delta-kicked'' rotor - a paradigm system for studying quantum chaos, and the effect of quantum resonance was demonstrated for the first time in a system of true quantum rotors. Control of uni-directional molecular rotation was proposed and demonstrated with a novel ``chiral pulse train'' - a sequence of femtosecond pulses with polarization rotating from pulse to pulse by a predefined angle. All the developed techniques offer new tools in coherent control of atomic and molecular wavepackets on an ultrashort time scale.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Silicon photonic filters for wavelength-division multiplexing and sensing applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wei, Shi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis is a theoretical and experimental study of novel silicon photonic filters, such as traveling-wave resonators (TWRs) and grating-assisted, contra-directional couplers (contra-DCs), for on-chip wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) systems and sensing applications. To measure optical losses of photonic components such as Y-branch splitters and waveguide crossings, we have developed a ring-resonator based technique which is accurate, simple, and space-efficient. A number of novel devices have been demonstrated using commercial CMOS-photonics fabrication foundries, with the aim of developing large-scale photonic integrated circuits using the standard process development tools. Two types of wavelength-selective, TWR-based reflective filters have been demonstrated for applications such as remote sensing and tunable lasers. Ultra-compact, high-Q microdisk resonators have been demonstrated, with radii of down to 1.5 µm, free spectral ranges (FSRs) of up to 71 nm, loaded Q's of up to 88,000, and unloaded Q's of over 100,000. Contra-DCs have been studied using coupled-mode theory. An add-drop filter designed using contra-DCs in slab-modulated rib waveguides has been proposed and demonstrated, which shows a flat-top response and a narrow bandwidth of 50--100 GHz, promising for dense-WDM applications. Also, we proposed an out-of-phase grating design to suppress the intra-waveguide reflection in contra-DCs. Using this novel anti-reflection (AR) design, we have demonstrated an add-drop filter with a single-band, flat-top response and a wide channel bandwidth of 6.5 nm, which enables athermal operation in a large temperature span of &gt; 70 K. This AR contra-DC can be used to build an on-chip coarse-WDM system for power-efficient, ultra-high-speed optical interconnects. Furthermore, we have proposed and demonstrated an electrically tunable phase-shifted contra-DC. In order to overcome the challenges facing microring resonators, such as limited FSRs and difficulty in controlling the bus-resonator coupling, we have proposed to integrate contra-DCs with microring resonators for selective bus-resonator coupling. Using this method, we have demonstrated a single dominant resonant mode in a microring resonator that originally has a small FSR of 1.3 nm. This grating-coupled microring resonator is promising for applications that need a huge free spectral range, such as cascaded resonator sensor arrays and ultra-high-bandwidth WDM systems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Design and application of combined multiphoton microscopy and optical coherence tomography system</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhou, Yifeng</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive optical tomographic technique based on the principle of interferometry. It can capture micrometer-resolution, three-dimensional images of tissues over millimeter field-of-view at a fast speed. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) is an emerging imaging modality based on the excitation of nonlinear signals from fluorescent molecules and the induction of second harmonic generation (SHG). It is capable of en-face high-resolution imaging with sub-micron resolution. Although OCT and MPM are essential imaging tools for disease diagnosis, each one of them has shortages, such as the low resolution of OCT and the low depth penetration of MPM. The purpose of this study is to design a multimodal imaging system by combining MPM and OCT into a single platform so that the two modalities can complement and overcome the shortages of each other. The design consists of two parts: hardware and software. For hardware, the two modalities are integrated into a single platform, sharing the laser source, the controlling scanners and the sample arm. In addition, the OCT has a reference arm for interference and a custom-built spectrometer for signal detection, whereas the MPM uses two photomultiplier tubes (PMT) for photon detection. For software, two user interfaces are specially designed to control beam scanning and data acquisition of the MPM and OCT respectively. The performance of this mutlimodal system is demonstrated by imaging biological samples. The results indicate that our system is capable of multiscale imaging of multilayered tissues with clear structures. One of the important applications of the multimodal system is measuring the refractive index (RI) and thickness of biological tissues. This capability is demonstrated on fish cornea. The results show our system is capable of imaging as well as quantitative characterization of RI and thickness of multilayered biological tissues. This system can potentially be a powerful tool for disease detection and surgery treatment.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Measurement of an off-axis neutrino beam energy spectrum</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kirby, Brian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The T2K long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment is designed to measure the neutrino flavour mixing parameter θ₁₃, as well as θ₂₃ and Δm²₂₃ with twenty times greater precision than previous measurements. A neutrino beam is produced using the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) proton accelerator in Tokai, Japan and is incident on the Super-Kamiokande water Cherenkov detector 295 km away beam at an off-axis angle of 2.5°. A suite of near detectors 280 m away from the proton target (ND280) provides additional constraints on beam flux estimates as well as measures neutrino interaction cross sections. A critical component of ND280 is a Fine Grained Detector (FGD) that provides an active target for neutrino interactions, with sufficient granularity to reconstruct short ranged particle tracks. This thesis describes the T2K experiment, the design and calibration of the FGD, and its online data reduction system. A cut-based selection for charged current neutrino interactions is used to produce quasi-elastic and non-quasi-elastic enhanced samples. These samples are used in a maximum likelihood fit to measure the T2K neutrino beam energy spectrum. The fit determines the flux scale factors that best reproduce the kinematic distribution of muons produced in selected interactions, and accounts for all relevant neutrino interaction model and detector systematic uncertainties. The fitted flux factors f(Eν) in the energy ranges defined for the analysis are as follows: f(0 &lt; Eν &lt; 0.5GeV ) = 1.10⁺⁰·²⁸₋₀.₂₄, f(0.5 &lt; Eν &lt; 1.0GeV ) = 0.93⁺⁰·¹⁷₋₀.₁₄, f(1.0 &lt; Eν &lt; 3.5GeV ) = 0.85⁺⁰·¹⁷₋₀.₁₄, f(Eν &gt; 3.5GeV ) = 0.92⁺⁰·²⁸₋₀.₂₃. These flux factors are consistent with the default neutrino beam flux prediction and the flux measurement used in the primary oscillation analysis of the T2K collaboration, and provide an independent confirmation that the neutrino beam flux model is reliable.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Measurements of neutrino interactions on water using a fine-grained scintillator detector with water targets</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Brook-Roberge, Daniel Grant</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Measurements of neutrino interaction cross-sections are important for the study of neutrino oscillations. For the T2K experiment, which has a near detector with a primarily carbon target and a far detector with an oxygen target, the cross-section difference is important for correctly comparing the neutrino fluxes at the two detectors. This dissertation presents a first measurement of the ratio between oxygen and carbon of the muon neutrino charge-current inclusive cross-section using the T2K near detector, ND280. The design and construction methods of the water target system in the ND280 Fine-Grained Detector (FGD) will be discussed, as will a new algorithm for reconstructing particle tracks contained within the FGD. The data analysis leading to the cross-section ratio measurement will be described. It is based on a statistical subtraction method which extracts the contribution of the FGD water mass to the total interaction rate for the FGD with water targets. We find an oxygen/carbon ratio of 1.129 ± 0.114 (stat) ± 0.044 (syst) from the ND280 data, a 1.39σ difference from the Monte Carlo prediction of 0.954 ± 0.029.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nonperturbative quantum field theory in astrophysics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mazur, Daniel Paul</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The extreme electromagnetic or gravitational fields associated with some astrophysical objects can give rise to macroscopic effects arising from the physics of the quantum vacuum. Therefore, these objects are incredible laboratories for exploring the physics of quantum field theories. In this dissertation, we explore this idea in three astrophysical scenarios. In the early universe, quantum fluctuations of a scalar field result in the generation of particles, and of the density fluctuations which seed the large- scale structure of the universe. These fluctuations are generated through quantum processes, but are ultimately treated classically. We explore how a quantum-to-classical transition may occur due to non-linear self-interactions of the scalar field. This mechanism is found to be too inefficient to explain classicality, meaning fields which do not become classical because of other mechanisms may maintain some evidence of their quantum origins. Magnetars are characterized by intense magnetic fields. In these fields, the quantum vacuum becomes a non-linear optical medium because of interactions between light and quantum fluctuations of electron-positron pairs. In addition, there is a plasma surrounding the magnetar which is a dissipative medium. We construct a numerical simulation of electromagnetic waves in this environment which is non-perturbative in the wave amplitudes and background field. This simulation reveals a new class of waves with highly non-linear structure that are stable against shock formation. The dense nuclear material in a neutron star is expected to be in a type-II superconducting state. In that case, the star’s intense magnetic fields will penetrate the core and crust through a dense lattice of flux tubes. However, depending on the details of the free energy associated with these flux tubes, the nuclear material may be in a type-I state which completely expels the field. We compute the quantum corrections to the classical energies of these flux tubes by creating a new, massively parallel Monte-Carlo simulation. The quantum contribution tends to make a small contribution which adds to the classical free energy. We also find a non-local interaction energy with a sign that depends on the field profile and spacing between flux tubes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Low-temperature thermochronology of the northern Carlin Trend : evidence for Late Cretaceous exhumation of northern central Nevada and short duration of Carlin ore-forming hydrothermal systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cruickshanks, Moira</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Samples were collected from Jurassic intrusions in the northern Carlin Trend to determine the thermal history of the region that was strongly affected by Late Cretaceous exhumation and Eocene hydrothermal fluid flow. Low-temperature apatite fission track and apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronology of the northern Carlin Trend records 3-4 km exhumation since the Late Jurassic. At least 1-2 km exhumation occurred during a phase of rapid exhumation between 85-60 Ma that is coincident with extensional collapse of the overthickened hinterland of the Sevier orogeny. Late Cretaceous exhumation ages provide a background against which ~40 Ma thermal anomalies associated with the formation of the Carlin-type Au deposits can be observed. In the northern Carlin Trend, a thermal halo defined by apatite fission track resetting was observed up to 400 m out from major fluid flow conduits around the Goldstrike Stock that is immediately south of the multi-million ounce Betze-Post deposit. A lack of hydrothermal alteration within the stock shows that Eocene hydrothermal fluid flow was concentrated around its edge, and that heating of the stock was predominantly conductive. Finite element modelling and forward modelling of time-temperature paths constrain the duration of a hydrothermal fluid event to on order of 10 kyr. Multiple phases of this duration of fluid flow are possible, but were either thermally isolated or were shorter-lived. The high rates of fluid flux associated with short fluid flow durations are similar to those observed in hydrothermal systems driven by forced convection or pressure-driven flow, suggesting fluid flow responsible for the formation of Carlin-type Au deposits was driven by a magmatic source or seismicity rather than free convection.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>New solid state laser crystals created by epitaxial growth</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kumaran, Raveen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Rare-earth-doped oxide crystals such as Nd:YAG are often used as the gain medium in solid state lasers because they produce a collection of sharp emission peaks, some of which have strong gain. Rather than the typical bulk form of these crystals, thin films with planar waveguide geometry are promising alternatives for compact devices with lower lasing thresholds and better heat extraction. Such benefits motivated the growth of these oxide films by molecular beam epitaxy, a technique capable of films with precise composition, thickness and structure due to its independently controlled elemental sources. Two sets of material systems were attempted, Al-Ga-O and Y-Al-O, with Nd as the sole dopant. The films were grown on sapphire substrates of various orientations, then analyzed by x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence where peaks signaled long-range and short-range order respectively. Work on the Al-Ga-O system yielded Nd:α-Al₂O₃ (Nd:sapphire) and Nd:α-Ga₂O₃, two new laser crystals with unique collections of sharp emission peaks only observable from single-crystal films grown at temperatures far below the melting point. These conditions were required to confine the much-larger Nd dopants into Al and Ga sites with short-range order, and are unlikely reproducible by bulk methods. Due to their shared corundum structure, the emission spectra from Nd:sapphire and Nd:α-Ga₂O₃ appear similar but wavelength-shifted. The dominant Nd:sapphire peak has strong gain comparable to its counterpart from Nd:YVO₄, one of the highest available, while the blue-shifted Nd:α-Ga₂O₃ peak is likewise comparable to Nd:YAG. Alloying both produced corundum-structure crystals with peaks that shifted linearly with unit cell volume, which in turn depended on Ga/Al ratio and film stress. These Al-Ga-O crystals are promising for applications involving compositional-tuning and graded-index layers. Ternary Y-Al-O is not tunable because it has three stable phases YAM, YAP and YAG with different compositions, structures and thus emission spectra. Single-phase films of each phase were grown without single-crystal structure but still yielded sharp peaks consistent with their bulk counterparts. Short-range order was achievable because the Nd dopants were size-compatible with the Y sites. While the peaks did not shift with Y/Al ratio, peak sharpness improved when the ratio approached bulk stoichiometric values.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The application of symmetry methods and conservation laws to ordinary differential equations and a linear wave equation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hoskins, Jeremy G.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Symmetry analysis and conservation laws are widely used in analyzing and solving differential equations. Conservation laws are also called first integrals when dealing with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this thesis, the complementary nature of these two approaches is explored; specifically, the use of symmetries to find integrating factors and, conversely, the use of conservation laws to seek new symmetries. In Part 1, building upon results in [3] and [10], it is shown that a higher-order symmetries of an ODE induces a point symmetry of the corresponding integrating factor determining equations (IFDE), and an explicit expression for this induced symmetry is obtained. Secondly, it is shown that the converse also holds for a special class of Lie point symmetries of the IFDE; namely, all Lie point symmetries of the IFDE which are of this form project onto point symmetries of the original scalar ODE. In Part 2, the use of conservation laws to find non-local symmetries is shown for a linear one-dimensional wave equation in a two-layered medium with a smooth transition layer. The resulting analytic solutions are then studied in order to investigate the effect of the transmission and reflection of energy between the two media. It is found that the reflection and transmission coefficients depend on the ratio of the wave speeds in the two media as well as the ratio of the characteristic length of the incoming signal to the width of the transition layer. Approximations of the dependence of the reflection and transmission coefficients on these two parameters are also presented, obtained via numerical experiments performed using both the analytic solution and a finite element method.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Non-singlet sectors of the c=1 matrix model with connections to two dimensional string theory</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rabideau, Charles</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The goal of this thesis is to study non-singlet sectors of the c=1 matrix model in order to determine their connection with string theory in two space-time dimensions. It is well understood that the singlet sector of this matrix model is related to the closed string sector of the string theory. The adjoint sector has been connected to long strings stretching from an FZZT brane at infinity. The goal is to find a sector which includes a large number of these long strings which condense to form an FZZT brane in line with a proposal due to Gaiotto. Sectors corresponding to symmetric and antisymmetric tensor products of the fundamental and antifundamental representation of the U(N) symmetry of the matrix model are studied. Partition functions of the matrix model with a harmonic oscillator potential as well as bases for the Hilbert spaces are found for all these sectors. The first two representations are studied using a collective field approach with the inverted oscillator potential applicable to the c=1 model and are found to contain large numbers of long strings which form a free bosonic gas in the large N limit and so do not condense. On the other hand, in the third sector the degrees of freedom are fermionic and a shift in the ground state energy is found in the harmonic oscillator potential, which points to the existence of a Fermi sea and the condensation of the long strings. A collective field that can be used to study this sector is proposed and the technical difficulties presented by the study of this sector are discussed, but its study is left for future work.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Advances in terahertz frequency combs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Stead, Robert A.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Following a review of the theory of terahertz generation via optical rectification in nonlinear crystals, a method for enhancing the nonlinear conversion efficiency of this process is proposed. A nonlinear crystal is placed at the intracavity focus of a passive optical resonator, which is seeded by an ytterbium-doped fibre laser. Models of this arrangement indicate that an enhancement of the optical field of several orders of magnitude is possible. As the difference frequency radiation produced through the optical rectification process results from a mixing of the spectral components of the optical field, one expects a corresponding increase in the terahertz field. We present a design of optical resonator that compensates for the large group velocity dispersion of the nonlinear crystal. Our experimental results indicate that below bandgap absorption in the crystal severely limits the resulting enhancement of the optical field, and hence the terahertz field one would expect from this nonlinear process. A scanning-delay terahertz time-domain spectrometer has been constructed, using a gallium phosphide guiding structure to increase the interaction length of the optical and terahertz fields, thereby increasing the terahertz power produced. Our experiment demonstrates 20 dB signal to noise ratio over the spectral range of 0.5-1 THz. We propose a method for increasing the spectral resolution, whilst simultaneously reducing the required data acquisition time of such a terahertz spectrometer, through the use of two femtosecond optical frequency combs. One of these fields drives the nonlinear optical rectification process, whilst the second serves as a sampling local oscillator field to probe the terahertz field via electro-optic sampling in a second nonlinear crystal. By precisely controlling the relative pulse repetition rates of the two oscillators, we show that the full spectral content of the terahertz field can be acquired at rf frequencies, and without the slow mechanical delay lines associated with conventional terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. Finally, we present experimental efforts towards the demonstration of this technique, and show that, to be effective, steps must be taken to increase the strength of the expected rf signal over that of the measurement noise floor.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Absolute value of the magnetic penetration depth and field profile in the Meissner state of exotic superconductors Yttrium barium copper oxide and Co-doped pnictide</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hossain, Md Masrur</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>One of the fundamental quantities of a superconductor is the magnetic penetration depth, λ, which is the characteristic length scale that a magnetic field penetrates into the surface of a superconductor while in the Meissner state. In the clean limit the absolute value of λ is directly related to the superfluid density ns via 1/λ² = μοe²ns/m∗ , where m∗ is the effective mass. Consequently, its variation as a function of temperature, doping and orientation are of central importance in testing microscopic theories of exotic superconductors. A low energy beam of spin polarized muons has recently been developed, at the Paul Scherrrer Institute, to directly measure λ in a superconductor. When a muon (μ+) decays, it emits a fast decay positron preferentially along the direction of its spin due to the parity violating decay. The time evolution of statistical average direction of the spin polarization of the muon ensemble depends sensitively on the local magnetic field which can be monitored as a function of the mean depth of implantation. In this way it is possible to measure the field profile near the surface of a superconductor and extract the magnetic penetration depth in a direct manner which is not otherwise possible with conventional bulk methods. In this thesis, accurate measurements of λ and its anisotropy (≡ λa /λb) have been made for three different oxygen (x = 6.52, 6.92 and 6.998) contents of YBa₂Cu₃O₆₊x as well as in Ba(Co₀.₀₇₄Fe₀.₉₂₆₎₂As₂. The measured values of λ and the in-plane anisotropies are considerably different from that reported in the literature, using less direct methods. The a – b anisotropy is surprisingly insensitive to x in YBa₂Cu₃O₆₊x . We observe an exponential decay of the magnetic field and corresponding supercurrent density deep inside the crystals. Small deviations from the London model are observed which indicate there is a suppression of the supercurrent density close to the surface. The measured (λ) values are also found to depart substantially from the Uemura relation Tcα 1/λ² .</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Acquisition of transparent refractive media</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Atcheson, Bradley</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Transparent refractive media are invisible but for the distortions they impart upon a background scene. Computerised acquisition of such media can therefore often not be performed via traditional scanning methods. By capturing refracted backgrounds rather than reflections off the target media itself, we develop techniques for reconstructing the intervening refractive index distribution for both static and time-varying media. The approach is based on tracking optical distortions and then performing tomographic reconstruction. For multi-view tomography we first require a suitably calibrated camera array. To this end we show how to temporally synchronise and geometrically calibrate an array of consumer-grade video cameras that can scale to larger sizes, and at lower cost, than a comparative array of machine vision cameras. For media of low dynamic refractive index range, such as mixing gases, we show how to acquire data and formulate a linear least-squares problem to solve for the refractive index distribution. Unlike traditional methods of fluid flow measurement, ours is non-invasive and fully volumetric. For materials of higher dynamic refractive index range, we develop an alternative acquisition method based on temporally-encoded structured light patterns. Media causing significant distortion of light rays give rise to a large, nonlinear inverse problem. Results indicate that grid resolution relative to the minimum refractive feature size is a key factor limiting the accuracy of reconstructions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Beta-detected NMR of ⁸Li⁺ in spintronic materials</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Song, Qun</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>β-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (βNMR) employs radioactive ⁸Li⁺ , which is optically spin-polarized, as a local probe to study magnetism in materials via β decay. In this thesis, βNMR is applied to spintronic materials, including GaAs, Ga₁₋xMnx Asand Fe/GaAs heterostructures in a depth-controlled manner at TRIUMF. High resolution β-NMR measurements were carried out on GaAs crystals (semi-insulating (SI-GaAs) and heavily doped n-type (n-GaAs)) as a control experiment for β-NMR on Fe/GaAs heterostructures. A small resonance shift was observed and found to be dependent on depth, temperature and doping. The depth dependence is only observed in SI-GaAs and not in n-GaAs. The resonance shift below 150 K in both GaAs is ∼ 100 ppm, on the same order of some Knight shifts of ⁸Li⁺ in noble metals. Ga₁₋xMnxAs is the first βNMR study on a ferromagnetic material through the ferromagnetic transition. Both spin lattice relaxation (SLR) and resonance of ⁸Li⁺ were measured. Two resonances were clearly resolved from the nonmagnetic GaAs substrate and the magnetic Ga₁₋xMnxAs film. The latter one negatively shifts and is linearly proportional to the applied field. The hyperfine coupling constant AHF of ⁸Li⁺ in Ga₁₋xMnxAs is found to be negative. The SLR rate λ does not follow Korringa’s Law and its amplitude shows a weak temperature dependence through TC. The behaviours of AHF and λ suggest that the delocalized holes originate from a Mn derived impurity band. No evidence of magnetic phase separation is found. ⁸Li⁺ provides a new depth-dependent local probe to detect injected spin polarization. We measured the ⁸Li⁺ resonance in Fe/GaAs heterostructures with semi-insulating and heavily doped n-type substrates, with and without injected current. With zero current, no spin polarization at thermal equilibrium is found. A new current injection system was designed and setup to conduct current injection from the thin Fe layer into the n-GaAs substrate. We found effects of local Joule heating and a very small stray field caused by the injected current but no convincing evidence of injected spin polarization.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An optical functional analysis of amorphous semiconductors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Minar, Sanjida Begum</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Models for the spectral dependence of the real and imaginary components of the dielectric function, appropriate for the case of amorphous semiconductors,are considered. In the first phase of this analysis, from an empirical expression for the imaginary part of the dielectric function, this expression corresponding to that of Jellison and Modine [G. E. Jellison, Jr. and F. A. Modine, "Parameterization of the optical functions of amorphous materials in the interband region," Applied Physics Letters, vol. 69, pp. 371-373, 1996],a closed-form expression for the real part of the dielectric function is determined using a Kramers-Kronig transformation. The resultant expression for the real component of the dielectric function corresponds with that of the model of Jellison and Modine. The subsequent comparison with experiment is found to be satisfactory. Then, in the latter stage of this analysis, through the application of a Kramers-Kronig transformation on an empirical model for the imaginary part of the dielectric function, this model stemming from a model for the distributions of electronic states, the spectral dependence of the real part of the dielectric function is determined. Fits with the results of experiment, taken over the near-infrared, visible, and near-ultraviolet, are also found to be satisfactory.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Phase transitions in the neighbourhood of mean field theory</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Timmers, Dennis</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We study systems consisting of interacting spin particles which can have a positive or negative spin. We consider an Ising model and a type of Widom-Rowlinson (WR) model. The interactions between spin particles are regulated by Kac potentials which carry a parameter ɣ. It is known that in the Kac limit, as ɣ tends to zero, models with Kac potentials become mean field theory. Mean field theory is known to exhibit phase transitions. The focus of this work is to prove phase transitions not only in the Kac limit but also near the Kac limit i.e., for ɣ small but strictly positive. Placing the Ising and WR model in a rectangular box with side-length L and periodic boundary conditions defines finite volume Gibbs measures. The infinite volume Gibbs state ν is the limit of the finite volume Gibbs measures as L tends to infinity. A particle system exhibits a phase transition if ν is a mixture of ergodic states. The main achievement of this thesis is the development of a new method to prove phase transitions. We first apply the Kac-Siegert transformation which reformulates the particle system by introducing an auxiliary field. The spin-spin interactions are replaced by interactions of the spin particles with the auxiliary field. The main idea of this dissertation is to study the mean auxiliary field. In principle it should be easier to work with the mean field because, as we will show, it is approximately Gaussian. By a new expansion around mean field theory we prove that for ɣ strictly positive but small the infinite volume Gibbs state for the auxiliary field, for both the Ising and the WR model, is a mixture of two ergodic states. It is shown that this implies that the infinite volume Gibbs state for both the Ising and WR model is a mixture of two ergodic states. One Gibbs state predominantly has positive spin particles, the other Gibbs state predominantly has negative spin particles. The new expansion is related to the Glimm Jaffe Spencer expansion around mean field theory.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Unconventional Peierls physics in underdoped Bi2201</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rosen, Jonathan Adam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The puzzling physics of the high-temperature superconducting cuprates has led to many important questions and investigations regarding the mechanism of high-Tc's. This dissertation demonstrates that, through detailed experimental studies using angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), a new type of periodic structural distortion exists in Bi₂Sr₂-xLaxCuO₆₊d (La-Bi2201), leading to the existence of multiple periodic lattice distortions (PLD) in the underdoped material. Photon-energy dependent ARPES reveals photoelectron diffraction effects that exhibit all relevant length scales as oscillations in the ARPES matrix element, leading to the observation of all of the diffraction-replica (DR) bands associated with the multiple PLD's. Furthermore, a charge-density-wave (CDW) associated with the new PLD at the crystal surface with a temperature-dependent wavelength is observed. A Ginzburg-Landau mean field model is shown to exhibit the same temperature-dependence from a combination of Fermi surface nesting and lattice commensurability affected by the temperature-dependent harmonic content of the CDW. A detailed temperature-dependence of the antinodal pseudogap reveals two simultaneous energy and temperature scales: one associated with the CDW, and the other in agreement with the magneto-optical Kerr effect and magnetic neutron diffraction results in the literature. Detailed nodal ARPES lineshapes reveal a peak in the real-part of the self-energy that coincides with band-crossing positions and the nodal ''kink'' energies for all dopings, providing evidence that these disparate features can be collectively explained by band hybridization allowed in the fully incommensurate crystal, which does not preserve parity. This provides one route to explain these phenomena - as a product of nested van-Hove singularities along the nodal line in underdoped La-Bi2201, which result in a Peierls distortion similar to the dichalcogenide CDW superconductors.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Feasibility test of exotic particle searches in the decay of trapped rubidium isomers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kong, Tao</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We tested the feasibility of searching for exotic particle emissions in the decay of trapped Rb isomers by measuring the recoiling momentum of the decay daughters. Massive particle emissions would cause the daughters to recoil at a momentum less than the case of a photon emission, and show up as a lower peak in the recoiling momentum spectrum. ⁸⁶mRb isomer decay (6- → 2-) was chosen as the experimental subject, which allows a search for 0⁺ and 1- massive particles with a mass range between 0 and 556 keV/c². To measure the recoiling momentum of the neutral Rb-⁸⁶g decay daughters, they must first be photoionized to be collected by the spectrometer and detected by the MCP detectors. The photoionization scheme is a two-stepwise procedure, including Doppler-free two-photon transitions from the 5S₁/₂ to 5D₅/₂ states by a 778 nm laser, and from the 5D₅/₂ state into continuum by a 1064 nm laser. The recoiling momenta of the Rb-⁸⁶g decay daughters were reconstructed by measuring the Rb ions' time-of-flight and transverse displacements on the ion detector. The achieved momentum resolution for the 556 keV/c photoions is 15(3) keV/c, which is twice the expectation due to the sagging of the spectrometer mesh. Because of the photoionization rate limitation, the achieved sensitivity is at 10% decay branch compared to gamma emissions. A feasibility study to improve the sensitivity to 10-⁵ level is outlined and compared to the conventional experiments in this field. The exotic particle search experiment requires the isotope shift knowledge for efficiently driving Doppler-free two-photon transitions in radioactive Rb isotopes. In total, we measured isotope shifts of the 5S₁/₂ to 5D₅/₂ transition for three Rb isotopes, δν{⁸⁶m,⁸⁷} = -69.46(3) MHz, δν{⁸⁶g,⁸⁷} = -83.62(2) MHz and δν{⁸¹g,⁸⁷} = -552.34(27) MHz. The precision we achieved in the isotope shift measurements allows us to deduce the specific mass shifts between the 5S₁/₂ and 5D₅/₂ states with 4 - 28 MHz precision by making a King plot. This provides a benchmark for the isotope shift calculations needed for the cosmological tests of time and space variations of the fine structure constant Alpha by astrophysical spectroscopy of alkali-like species.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>m-Liouville theorems and regularity results for elliptic PDEs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Fazly, Mostafa</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis which is a compendium of seven papers, focuses on the study of the semilinear elliptic equations and systems, on both bounded and unbounded domains of dimension n, most importantly the Allen-Cahn equation and the De Giorgi’s conjecture (1978). This conjecture brings together two groups of mathematicians: one specializing in nonlinear partial differential equations and another in differential geometry, more specifically on minimal surfaces and constant mean curvature surfaces. De Giorgi conjectured that the monotone and bounded solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation on the whole space of dimension n ≤ 8 must be 1-dimensional solutions. This is known to be true for n ≤ 3 and with extra (natural) assumptions for 4 ≤ n ≤ 8. Motivated by this conjecture, I have introduced two main concepts: The first concept is the “H-monotone solutions” that allows us to formulate a counterpart of the De Giorgi’s conjecture for system of equations stating that the H-monotone and bounded solutions of the gradient systems on the whole space of dimension n ≤ 8 must be 1-dimensional solutions. This seems to be in the right track to extend the De Giorgi's conjecture to systems. The second concept is the “m-Liouville theorem” for m = 0, · · · , n − 1 that allows us to formulate a counterpart of the De Giorgi’s conjecture for equations but this time for higher-dimensional solutions as opposed to 1-dimensional solutions. We use the induction idea that is to use 0-Liouville theorem (0- dimensional solutions) to prove 1-Liouville theorem (1-dimensional solutions) and then to prove (n − 1)- Liouville theorem ((n − 1)-dimensional solutions). The reason that we call this “m-Liouville theorem” is because of the great mathematician Joseph Liouville (1809-1882) who proved a classical theorem in complex analysis stating that "bounded harmonic functions on the whole space must be constant" and constants are 0-dimensional objects. 0-Liouville theorem is at the heart of this thesis and it includes various 0-Liouville theorems for various equations and system. In particular, we give a positive answer to the Henon-Lane-Emden conjecture in dimension three under an extra boundedness assumption. On the other hand, it is well known that there is a close relationship between the regularity of solutions on bounded domains and 0-Liouville theorem for related “limiting equations” on the whole space, via rescaling and blow up procedures. In this direction, we present regularity of solutions for gradient and twisted-gradient systems as well as the uniqueness results for nonlocal eigenvalue problems. The novelty here is a stability inequality for both gradient and twisted-gradient systems that gives us the chance to adjust the known techniques and ideas (for equations) to systems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Coherent optical wireless communications over atmospheric turbulence channels</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Niu, Mingbo</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Recent advances in free-space optics have made outdoor optical wireless communication (OWC) an attractive solution to the “last-mile” problem of broadband access networks. Significant chal- lenges can, however, arise for OWC links with increased levels of atmospheric turbulence from time-varying temperatures and pressures. As a promising alternative to the current generation of on-off keying (OOK) direct detection based OWC system, the coherent OWC system is studied in this thesis for a variety of turbulence conditions. Since coherent OWC system performance is found to be impaired severely under strong turbulence conditions, spatial diversity techniques, e.g., maximum ratio combining (MRC), equal gain combining (EGC), and selection combining (SC), are adopted to overcome turbulence impacts. The results are then generalized to Gamma-Gamma turbulence for MRC and EGC with perfect channel or phase estimation. The impacts of phase noise compensation error on coherent OWC system performance are investigated, and it is found that such impacts can be small when the standard deviation of the phase noise compensation error is kept below twenty degrees. A postdetection EGC scheme using differential phase-shift keying (PSK) is proposed and is shown to be a viable alternative to overcome phase noise impacts. The subcarrier intensity modulation (SIM) based OWC system has been proposed as another alternative to the OOK system. With a unified average signal-to-noise ratio definition, system per- formance is compared for coherent and SIM links over the Gamma-Gamma turbulence channels. Closed-form error rate expressions are derived for coherent and SIM systems using MRC, EGC and SC schemes. It is found that the coherent systems outperform the SIM systems significantly. The benefits of coherent systems come chiefly from the large local oscillator power which eliminates the effects of the thermal and ambient noises that dominate in SIM systems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Microfabricated electromagnetic actuators for confocal measurements and imaging</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mansoor, Hadi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Various optical microscopy techniques have been developed for micrometer level imaging of biological tissue samples. Among those techniques, confocal imaging provides superior image contrast and high resolution with a modest system cost. Confocal microscopy allows vertical optical sectioning (imaging a section perpendicular to the surface of tissue) or horizontal optical sectioning (imaging a section parallel to the surface of tissue) and provides high-resolution tissue morphology that is analogous to conventional histopathology images. This has brought up a tremendous potential for guiding surgical biopsies and in vivo non-invasive diagnosis of diseases such as cancer. The challenge in moving microscopic imaging modalities into clinical applications is miniaturization into a form of hand-held devices or catheters for endoscopic applications. In this thesis, micro-fabrication techniques such as Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication process and laser micromachining have been employed to develop magnetic actuators. The actuators are then used to move lenses and optical fibers in order to scan a laser beam across a sample. Lens and fiber actuators are integrated in catheter and hand-held devices for confocal thickness measurement and optical sectioning imaging of biological samples. Thickness measurement is performed by scanning the focal point of a microlens across the thickness of thin films or layered biological tissues and collecting the intensity signal of the single scattering light reflected back from the samples as a function of lens position. A catheter was developed and thickness measurements of polymer layers and biological tissues were demonstrated. The device has optical resolution of 32 µm with expanded uncertainty of measurement of 11.86 µm. Lens and fiber optic actuators have been coupled to form two-dimensional imaging devices. Direct and real-time vertical and horizontal cross-sectional imaging of biological samples has been demonstrated. Vertical imaging is performed by transverse (X-axis) and axial (Z-axis) scanning of a focused laser beam using an optical fiber and a microlens actuator respectively. Horizontal imaging is done by a 2-axis fiber optic scanner. All the developed actuators are driven by electromagnetic forces and require low driving voltages. Confocal imaging of biological samples, with lateral resolution of 1.55 µm, has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on unconventional superconductor strontium ruthenate</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Veenstra, Christian Neil</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis represents two bodies of work: a detailed look at what angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measures, as well as ARPES and circularly polarized photon spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (CPS-ARPES) measurements on the unconventional superconductor Sr₂RuO₄. In the first part I present a study of both established methods of ARPES analysis and some new variations on model spectral functions. This modelling was done in a realistic regime, yet far from the limits often assumed. Away from these limits I show that any "effective coupling" inferred from quasiparticle renormalizations differs drastically and unpredictably from the true coupling. Conversely, I show that perturbation theory retains good predictive power where expected, that the momentum dependence of the self-energy can be revealed via the relationship between velocity renormalization and quasiparticle strength, and that it is often possible to infer the self-energy and bare electronic structure through lineshape analysis. In the second part I present experimental ARPES and CPS-ARPES data on Sr₂RuO₄. Newly discovered and unexplained ARPES features are characterized and compared with a variety of different possible structural distortions through bulk and slab local-density approximation (LDA) band structure calculations. I thereby rule out phases driven by electronic interaction, such as Dirac- or Rashba-type surface states, and instead find that there exists a progressive structural modulation whereby both the surface and (at a minimum) sub-surface layers exhibit a (√2 x √2)R45° reconstruction. Through CPS-ARPES on Sr₂RuO₄ I also directly demonstrate that the effects of spin-orbit (SO) coupling are not limited to a modification of the band structure, but fundamentally entangle the spin and spatial parts of the wave-function. This must drive the superconducting state in Sr₂RuO₄ to be even more unconventional than is generally assumed, with mixing between singlet and triplet states that varies around the Fermi surface, and thereby offers a possible resolution to a number of experiments that clash with the categorization of Sr₂RuO₄ as a hallmark spin-triplet chiral p-wave superconductor.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Enhancing particle methods for fluid simulation in computer graphics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Schechter, Hagit</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We introduce novel methods for enriched Lagrangian fluid simulation in three distinct areas: smoke animation, liquid animation, and surfacing of simulation particle data. The techniques share a common goal, to efficiently enhance realism of natural-phenomena animations in particle simulation framework. Sub-Grid Turbulence adds synthesized small scale detail to large scale smoke simulation. The transport, diffusion and spectral cascade of turbulent energy are captured, whereas they are left unresolved on a typical simulation grid. Ghost-SPH handling of free-surface and solid boundary conditions in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics liquid simulation captures realistic cohesion for the first time and avoids the spurious numerical errors of previous approaches. Ghost particles are carefully seeded in the air and solid regions near the fluid and are assigned with extrapolated fluid quantities to reach correct boundary conditions. The Beta Mesh is a new method for reconstructing mostly temporally coherent surface meshes from particles representing the volume of a liquid. While current particle surfacing techniques address the geometrical characteristics of the surface, the focus in Beta Mesh is producing a surface which varies smoothly in time, outside of topological changes, while preserving essential geometrical properties.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>10GHz sky survey to probe inflation with CMB polarization</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tanimura, Hideki</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background(CMB) contain a lot of information on the history and composition of our universe. In particular, the rich detail about our early universe is included in the angular power spectra of the CMB fluctuations, which constrains the cosmological parameters in current models of the universe. The latest cosmological data strongly support an inflationary Lambda CDM cosmology with a minimal six parameters to describe our universe. The next challenge in cosmology is to probe the physics of the inflationary period by looking for the signature of primordial gravitational waves in the polarized CMB. CMB polarization was generated at last scattering by scalar and tensor perturbations in the primordial fluid. The tensor perturbations are produced by the stretching of space-time by gravitational wave fluctuations, while scalar perturbations are produced by density fluctuations in the primordial fluid. The ratio of the tensor to scalar perturbation amplitude, r, is a key tracer of the physics of the inflationary epoch, which is deeply connected to the energy scale of inflation in a standard inflationary model. A local quadrupole anisotropy in the radiation field at the time of decoupling causes the linear polarization in CMB through Thomson scattering by electrons. The CMB polarization can be decomposed into two rotationally invariant quantities, called E and B. The CMB B-mode is a direct tracer of the tensor perturbations caused by gravitational waves in the inflationary period of the universe. Thus, the detection of B-mode has currently been dubbed the ''smoking gun'' of inflation. However, the galactic foreground emissions also have much stronger E- and B-modes polarization. We intend to produce half-sky maps of total intensity and linear polarization at 10 GHz. This data would probe galactic synchrotron emission and also can help constrain the so-called anomalous emission. Therefore, the maps can be used with other surveys such as WMAP and Planck to subtract galactic foreground emissions and obtain more precise CMB data. In addition, the data will give us information about galactic emission components such as synchrotron, free-free, thermal dust and anomalous emission in the microwave range.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Search for long-lived neutral particles in final states with a muon and multi-track displaced vertex with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Loh, Chang Wei</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This work presents the result of a search for a new long-lived neutral particle decaying into a muon and charged hadrons in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with a total integrated luminosity of 4.4 inverse femtobarn, using the ATLAS detector located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Many extensions to the current Standard Model of particle physics predict the existence of such new particles, including the neutralino in an R-parity violating supersymmetry scenario. In this search, a set of selection criteria has been established to be sensitive to this kind of signal, in addition to evaluating the background in a data-driven manner. No excess of events above the expected background is observed with the collected data and limits are set on the squark pair production cross section, multiplied by the branching ratio for a squark to decay, via a long-lived neutralino, to a muon and charged hadrons, as a function of the neutralino lifetime.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Characterizing magnetization exchange in healthy human brain and bovine brain</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kalantari, Saeed</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Multi component T₂ relaxation imaging is an established MRI technique for measuring myelin water (MW, water molecules trapped between myelin sheath bilayers). Myelin water fraction (MWF, the fraction of central nervous system water with a short T₂) has been quantitatively correlated to histological staining for myelin in central nervous system tissue and hence is considered an in vivo measure of myelin content. Various studies have reported on the measurement of MWF with a diverse range of neurological diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Phenylketonuria (PKU). Although T₂ relaxation is the main probe for measuring MWF, understanding longitudinal relaxation, T1, is essential in a number ways such as the following: 1) Estimation of the corrections for myelin water fraction that need to be taken into account due to water exchange processes in white matter in vivo is highly dependent on T₁ relaxation. 2) Investigating the effect of T1-weighting in MWF measurements at short TR. This is especially important due to recent breakthroughs in developing rapid 3-D whole brain approaches to MWF measurements that are pushing towards shorter and shorter TR times in order to make this technique a valuable clinical imaging tool. First, in vivo MRI data from multi-component T₂ relaxation from 57 healthy subjects collected at 3.0 T was analyzed to estimate the corrections which have to be taken into account due to magnetization exchange in white matter. These results showed that these MWF corrections were less than 15% and are uniform across various white matter structures. Next, the variation of MWF as function of repetition time (TR) was investigated using in vivo MRI data collected at 3.0 T from healthy subjects. These results clearly showed that the measured MWF increased as the TR decreased. Finally, in order to measure T₁ as well as the rate of magnetization exchange with higher precision, data from bovine brain white matter was collected using a 4.7 T NMR spectrometer. The results from this study clearly showed that the T₁ had two components; therefore magnetization in bovine white matter is not in a fast exchange regime on the T₁ timescale.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Correlated molecular plasmas</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Morrison, Jonathan P.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Ultracold neutral plasmas (UNPs) are highly correlated, charged-particle systems studied in standard atomic-molecular optical physics laboratories. Advances in ultracold physics techniques have led to the development of magneto-optical traps that permit the localization of micro-Kelvin temperature atomic samples (10⁸ - 10¹⁰ cm -³ that can be photoionized with a defined excess laser energy. Magneto-optical trapping of molecules proves difficult, and to date, lags in reaching conditions attainable for atoms. Molecules possess additional degrees of freedom where energy can flow during laser trapping and cooling. Alternatively, elastic collisions with inert gases offer another route to low temperatures. Super-sonic expansions of target molecules seeded in a noble gas can reduced the translational temperature to values as low as 0.1 K. Here I report on the formation of a molecular ultracold plasma in a molecular beam of nitric oxide seeded in an inert gas. Our method does not directly form a plasma, but instead, I create a Rydberg gas that spontaneously evolves to a plasma. I have verified the transition to a collective plasma state by applying pulsed-fields to the field-free flight region, and observe a signal that persists well beyond classical field amplitudes required to ionize individual Rydberg states. Electric field screening is a collective effect occurring over a characteristic distance, quantified by the Debye length, λ_D. Molecular ultracold plasmas described here exhibit Debye lengths smaller than the overall size, λ_D&lt;&lt;σ. Plasmas of this nature offer an exotic environment for which to study fundamental phenomena. While plasmas are generally thought of as hot, UNPs exist at low enough temperatures that electrostatic interaction energy between particles is greater than their kinetic energy. At this point, charged particles begin to find themselves in local potential energy minima. Over the entire sample this translates to long-range order, or correlation. It is of great interest for researchers studying UNPs to maximize particle correlation, which requires UNPs to remain very cold, and dense through their lifetime.</dc:description>

We focus on two of the theories, known as Skyrme models, which have had application in various areas of physics. The third, which treats a complex scalar field, is principally viewed as a model problem to develop solution techniques. In all cases, time dependent, nonlinear partial differential equations in several spatial dimensions are solved computationally. Simulation of high energy collisions of the solitons is of particular interest. The solitons of the complex scalar field theory are known as Q-balls and carry a charge Q. We investigate the scattering of these objects, reproducing previous findings for collisions where the Q-balls have charge of the same sign. We obtain new results for interactions where the Q-balls have opposite charge, and for scattering of Q-balls against potential obstructions. The chief contributions of this thesis come from simulations performed within the context of a Skyrme model in two spatial dimensions. This is a multi-scalar theory with solitons known as baby skyrmions. We concentrate on the rich phenomenology seen in high-energy scattering of pairs of these objects, each of which has a topological charge that can be either positive or negative. We extend the understanding of the role of different parameters of the model in governing the outcome of head-on and off-axis collisions. The study of instabilities seen in previous simulations of Skyrme models is of central interest. Our results confirm that the governing partial differential equations become of mixed hyperbolic-elliptic type for interactions at sufficiently high-energy, as originally suggested by Crutchfield and Bell. We present strong evidence for the loss of energy conservation and smoothness of the dynamical fields in these instances. This supports the conclusion that the initial value problem at hand becomes ill-posed, so that the observed instabilities result from the nature of the equations themselves, and are not numerical artifacts. Finally, we present preliminary results for the typical phenomenology seen in head-on scattering of solitons in the Skyrme model in three spatial dimensions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Two dimensional hydrodynamic instabilities in shear flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Guha, Anirban</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Hydrodynamic instabilities occurring in two dimensional shear flows have been investigated. First, the process of resonant interaction between two progressive interfacial waves is studied. Such interaction produces exponentially growing instabilities in idealized, homogeneous or density stratified, inviscid shear layers. It is shown that two oppositely propagating interfacial waves, having arbitrary initial amplitudes and phases, eventually phase-lock, provided they satisfy a particular condition. Three types of shear instabilities - Kelvin Helmholtz, Holmboe and Taylor have been studied. The above-mentioned condition provides a range of unstable wavenumbers for each instability type, and this range matches the predictions of the canonical normal-mode based linear stability theory. The non-linear evolution of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability has been studied. The commonly known manifestation of KH is in the form of spiral billows. However, KH evolving from a piecewise linear shear layer is remarkably different; it is characterized by elliptical vortices of constant vorticity connected via thin braids. Using direct numerical simulation and contour dynamics, it is shown that the interaction between two counter-propagating vorticity waves is solely responsible for this KH formation. The oscillation of the vorticity wave amplitude, the rotation and nutation of the elliptical vortex, and straining of the braids have been investigated. Finally, the linear stability of plane Couette-Poiseuille flow in the presence of a cross-flow is studied. The base flow is characterized by the cross flow Reynolds number, Reinj and the dimensionless wall velocity, k. Corresponding to each dimensionless wall velocity, k ∈ [0,1], two ranges of Reinj exist where unconditional stability is observed. In the lower range of Reinj , for modest k we have a stabilization of long wavelengths leading to a cut-off Reinj. As Reinj is increased, we see first destabilization and then stabilization at very large Reinj. Analysis of the eigenspectrum suggests the cause of instability is due to resonant interactions of Tollmien-Schlichting waves.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical simulation of interfacial flows in micropores</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ahmadlouydarab, Majid</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Recent technological developments in microfluidics and fuel cells have given special significance to interfacial dynamics in small pores. Using a diffuse-interface model and a finite-element code, I have simulated three associated problems numerically: gas-liquid flow regimes in micropores; relative permeability for two-phase flow through a model porous medium; and dynamics of sessile drops under the simultaneous action of a wettability gradient and an external flow. For two-phase flows in corrugated microchannels driven by a pressure drop, a number of flow regimes were observed: gas flow, blockage, liquid flow, bubble-slug flow, droplet flow, annular flow and annular-droplet flow. Some of the regimes are known from prior studies in macroscopic pipes, but the others are new and specific to the micropores. Then a map of flow regimes has been constructed in the plane of the liquid saturation and the imposed pressure drop. The transitions among certain flow regimes show significant hysteresis, largely owing to the pinning of the interface at sharp corners in the flow conduit. As an extension of the above study, I computed the relative permeability of a model porous media made of corrugated tubes, using an averaging scheme over a pore-size-distribution of a real porous medium. I discovered that the flow rates vary nonlinearly with the pressure gradient, and that the extended Darcy's law does not hold in general. In the third project, I found that for each prescribed wetting gradient, there is a narrow range for the cross flow within which a stationary drop can be achieved. The drop motion exhibits strong hysteresis, i.e. sensitivity to initial conditions and forcing history. Two drops merge or separate depending on the competition between wettability and external flow. In general, the wettability gradient favors catch-up and coalescence while the external flow favors separation. These numerical simulations have demonstrated that novel interfacial dynamics can be produced in micropores where capillary forces and contact line dynamics play more important roles than in larger spatial dimensions. The numerical results may serve as guidelines to future experiments and technological development in microfluidics and lab-on-chip devices.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Displacement flow of complex fluids in an inclined duct</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Alba, Kamran</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis studies buoyant displacement flows with two miscible fluids in pipes and 2D channels that are inclined at an angle β measured from vertical changing from 0° to 90°. The focus is on inclination angles away from nearly horizontal since these flows are previously studied in full details in the literature. Detailed experimental, analytical and computational approaches are employed in an integrated fashion. Both density stable (light fluid displacing heavy one) and density unstable (heavy fluid displacing light fluid) displacements are studied. For density stable flows the study is purely experimental in the limit of iso-viscous Newtonian fluids. The density stable configuration has been found to produce highly efficient displacements, with the bulk of the interface moving steadily at the mean velocity. The streamwise length of the stretched interface increases with the mean flow velocity, viscosity and inclination β from vertical, and decreases with density difference. The rest of the thesis deals with density unstable configuration. From experimental point of view, the pipe displacement flows are studied for iso-viscous Newtonian and also viscoplastic fluids. In the Newtonian limit, completely different regimes than nearly-horizontal case are observed. As a first order approximation, different regimes are classified in a two-dimensional (Fr; Re cosβ/Fr plane) providing leading order correlations to transitions to different regimes. Similar regimes are found for channel geometry through numerical simulations of PELICANS code. For non-Newtonian fluids we have focused on industrially interesting cases of large yield stress fluids in the pipe. The two distinct flow regimes namely central-type and slump-type first observed in nearly horizontal angles were found to also persist over other inclinations. Completely new and exotic behaviors were also observed due to the effect of inclination angle and instabilities. From mathematical and modeling point of view a two-layer weighted residual model for generalized Newtonian fluids has been developed. The model works for channel geometry and can be used to predict the displacement interface height, the front velocity and more importantly, the flow stability.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hydrodynamic interaction between cylinders at moderate Reynolds numbers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Biswas, Anupam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The hydrodynamic interaction between two cylinders perpendicular to the freestream, in a tandem arrangement was studied for moderate Reynolds numbers (1≤Re≤40). The influence of multiple geometric variables was considered: separation distances between the cylinders, ellipticity of the cylinders, the cylinder aspect ratio, and the angular inclination between the cylinders. In the first part of this study, a numerical investigation of the two-dimensional steady flow past cylinders was carried out. The characteristic length, D, in all simulations was taken to be twice the major axis of the cylinder cross-section, (i.e. equal to the diameter for cylinders of circular cross-section). The two-dimensional flow was studied for separations up to 50D. Four different ellipticities were studied. The drags experienced by front and rear cylinders were compared with that experienced by a single cylinder of the same cross-section. The second part of the study consisted of the steady three-dimensional flow analysis for parallel cylinders in tandem for separations ranging from 2D to 20D and cylinder lengths up to 20D. In the third part of this thesis, a steady flow analysis was done for two circular cylinders in tandem with lengths equal to 5D but with the cylinder axes in different orientations relative to the plane normal to the flow. This angular separation between the cylinders produces a hydrodynamic moment, which is dependent on the geometry and the flow Reynolds number. The fourth and final part of this work is the study of the unsteady three-dimensional flow that would result from the hydrodynamic moment discussed in relation to the third part of the thesis. The thesis closes with some remarks on the implications of these findings to papermaking and recommendations for future work.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Applications of the gauge/gravity duality</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Whyte, Kevin Robert Leslie</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>While varied applications of gauge/gravity duality have arisen in literature from studies of condensed matter systems including superconductivity to studies of quenched Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), this thesis focuses on applications of the duality to holographic QCD-like ﬁeld theories and to inflationary model that uses a QCD-like ﬁeld theory. In particular the first half of the thesis examines a holographic QCD-like ﬁeld theory with scalar quarks closely related to the Sakai-Sugimoto model of holographic QCD. The behaviour of baryons and mesons in the model is examined to find a continuous mass spectrum for the mesons, and a baryon that can identified with a topological charge. It then slightly modifies the theory to further study the behaviour of holographic ﬁeld theories. The second half of the thesis presents a novel model for early Universe inflation, using an SU(N) gauge ﬁeld theory as the inflaton. The inflation model is studied at both weak coupling and strong coupling using the gauge/gravity duality. The robustness of model’s predictions to exciting multiple inflationary fields beyond the single ﬁeld of its original proposal, and its possible role in breaking the supersymmetry of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is also explored.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Evanescent field interactions in the scattering from cylinders with applications in super-resolution</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pawliuk, Peter Cornelius</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The diffraction limit defines the maximum resolution of an imaging system that collects and focuses waves. This limited resolution arises from the finite length of the waves used to create the image. Therefore, the only way to increase the resolution is to use higher frequencies with shorter wavelengths. For situations in which increasing the frequency is not possible or not desirable, super-resolution imaging techniques can be applied to overcome the diffraction limit. Super-resolution is possible with the inclusion of evanescent waves, which exhibit unlimited spatial frequencies. Evanescent waves decay exponentially away from their surface of origin so they are difficult to recover. One way to recover evanescent wave information is to scatter the wave from a small object. This scattering converts part of the evanescent wave into radiation that can propagate into the far-field where it can be detected. In order to characterize this conversion, the two-dimensional scattering of evanescent fields from a single cylinder and from multiple cylinders is investigated. The scattering models are derived using an analytical approach where the electromagnetic fields are broken down into cylindrical waves so that the boundary conditions on the cylinders can be applied directly. The incident field can be formulated from a vector plane-wave spectrum, which allows for an arbitrary combination of radiative and evanescent waves. Multiple cylinders of various sizes can be used to approximate the scattering from many two-dimensional objects. For simulating the imaging of objects buried underneath a surface, or near a planar interface, the model is separated into two dielectric half-spaces. An example of a super-resolution application for these models is the simulation of apertureless near-field scanning optical microscopy (ANSOM). In ANSOM, a probe is placed in the extreme near-field of an object in order to scatter the evanescent fields that are formed by the illumination of the object. Images created by ANSOM are fundamentally different from traditional images and are difficult to interpret. The simulations provide insight into how the images are formed and what information they contain.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Characterization of chirped photonic crystal fiber and its application in multiphoton microscopy</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yu, Jiali</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Multiphoton Microscopy (MPM) is a widely used imaging technique in the biomedicine field. Fiber-based multiphoton endoscopes are important for in vivo clinical application because they enable minimally invasive imaging. One major challenge for these endoscopes is the efficient delivery of ultrashort pulses in the near infrared region through the optical fibers. MPM requires ultrashort pulses to obtain high peak power for the nonlinear excitation. However, the optical fibers, can introduce dispersion which can severely broaden the pulses and reduce the peak power. The purpose of this study is to find a good candidate of optical fibers that can propagate sub-30 fs pulses while maintaining high peak power for the MPM excitation. In this project, I investigate the feasibility of applying a specially-designed chirped photonic crystal fiber (CPCF) for MPM imaging because CPCF has unique cell-size radial chirp can achieve low dispersion in a broadband transmission window. The key features of the CPCF are characterized, such as spectra, mode profile, and dispersion parameter, etc. A fiber-delivered MPM system is developed by adding the fiber coupling to a multimodal microscope. A prism-based dispersion pre-compensation unit is optimized to compensate the dispersion from all the optical components in the CPCF-delivered system. After pre-compensation, the appealing performance of CPCF applied in MPM is demonstrated by imaging various biological samples. Additionally, traditional hollow core fiber (HCF) is used as a comparison. The HCF consists of several identical reflective layers in the cladding. I pre-compensate the laser pulses after the HCF propagation and MPM images for similar samples are acquired. Large improvement in image contrast is observed in all samples for the system using the CPCF for light delivery compared with the system using the conventional HCF. The enhancement in second harmonic generation (SHG) is more significant than that in two photon excited fluorescence (TPEF). Our study shows that CPCF can successfully deliver sub-30 fs pulses with significantly increased excitation efficiency of MPM for the broad-band laser. These properties are highly sought after in MPM endoscopy. With the fiber delivery of femtosecond pulses, MPM can be developed into a portable system for in vivo imaging.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Emergence of Riemannian manifolds from graphs and aspects of Chern-Simons theory</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chen, Si</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis is divided into three chapters. Chapter 1 is a study of statistical models of graphs, in order to explore possible realizations of emergent manifolds. Graphs with given numbers of vertices and edges are considered, governed by a Hamiltonian that favors graphs with near-constant valency and local rotational symmetry. The model is simulated numerically in the canonical ensemble. It is found that the model exhibits a first-order phase transition, and that the low energy states are almost triangulations of two dimensional manifolds. The resulting manifold shows topological "handles" and surface intersections in a higher embedding space as well as non-trivial fractal dimension. The model exhibits a phase transition temperature of zero in the bulk limit. We explore the effects of adding long-range interactions to the model, which restore a finite transition temperature in the bulk limit. In Chapter 2, aspects of Chern-Simons theory are studied. The relations between Chern-Simons theory, a model known as BF theory named after the fields that appear in the actions, and 3D gravity, are explored and generalized to the case of non-orientable spacetime manifolds. U(1) Chern-Simons theory is quantized canonically on orientable manifolds, and U(1) BF theory is similarly quantized on non-orientable manifolds. By requiring the quantum states to form a representation of the deformed holonomy group and the deformed large gauge transformation group, we find that the mapping class group of the spacetime manifold can be consistently represented, provided the prefactor k of the Chern-Simon action satisfies quantization conditions which in general are non-trivial. We also find a k &lt;--&gt; 1/k duality for the representations. Motivated by open questions about interpreting the finite size results from Chapter 1, models of finite size scaling for systems with a first-order phase transition are discussed in Chapter 3. Three physics models -- the Potts model, the Go model for protein folding, and the graph model in Chapter 1 -- are simulated. Several finite size scaling models, including three functional forms to fit the energy distributions, and a capillarity model, are compared with simulations of the corresponding physics models.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Particle phenomenology at the frontiers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Winslow, Peter</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The Standard Model of particle physics has proven itself as a wildly successful description of the microscopic world. Yet, despite all its accomplishments, deep mysteries remain for which the Standard Model offers no explanation. This thesis is dedicated to the phenomenological study, as well as the creation of, a number of well-motivated extensions to the Standard Model, each originally designed to explain a known flaw. The Randall-Sundrum model employs an extra dimension to exponentially suppress all mass scales in the theory, generating the electroweak-Planck hierarchy with no recourse to fine-tuning of parameters. In this way, it can lead to unwanted enhancements of higher dimensional operators inducing strongly constrained processes such as proton decay. We investigate the effects of the Randall-Sundrum model on a similar process, neutron-antineutron oscillation, and find that, in contrast to the example of proton decay, it is naturally suppressed below experimental limits by virtue of the flavor structure of the operators inducing it. The DZero collaboration has reported strong evidence of CP violation beyond the Standard Model in measurements of the like-sign dimuon asymmetry at the Tevatron. The nature of the signal suggests the presence of new physics in the form of new bosonic particles with weak scale masses and new sources of CP violation in the mixing of neutral B mesons. We note that this is exactly what is needed for viable electroweak baryogenesis in extensions of the Standard Model. We explore the potential for simultaneously explaining the dimuon asymmetry and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe using a Two-Higgs-Doublet-Model with an unusual flavor structure. Both the CDF and DZero collaborations measure a strong preference for top quarks, produced in pairs at the Tevatron, to propagate in the direction of the initial proton beam, in direct conflict with Standard Model predictions. A class of new physics models with novel flavor interactions has been proposed to explain this behaviour through a Rutherford enhancement in the forward direction. We show that such interactions can also simultaneously explain a long-standing tension between different measurements of the CKM matrix element Vub through the generation of large loop-induced right-handed charge currents.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Interfacial effects in visco-plastic lubrication flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Dunbrack, Geoffrey E.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Poiseuille flows with yield stress fluids produce an unyielded central plug which can act as a solid conduit surrounding central (core) flows of Newtonian or power law fluids. Effectively, the annular yield stress fluid acts as a lubricant that isolates the core flow from wall friction. Stable flows with a yield stress annular fluid and a Newtonian or power law core fluid are termed viso-plastic lubrication (VPL) flows. This study examined interfacial effects in vertical VPL Poiseuille flows using a carbopol solution as the annular (yield stress) fluid and xanthan (inelastic shear thinning fluid) or polyethlyeneoxide (PEO; an elastic shear thinning fluid) as the core fluids. Experiments with the inelastic core fluid (xanthan) involved introducing stepped (high to low) or pulsed (high to low to high) changes in the core flow to an established stable VPL flow. Step changes produced a "yield front" (narrowing of the core flow or "interfacial radius") that propagated upward at a velocity considerably greater than the velocity of the annular carbopol plug but close to the average velocity of the xanthan core flow following the step change. Pulsed changes in the core flow produced one of three outcomes depending on the magnitude of the flows preceding and following the step change: (1) a stable ("frozen in") deformation in the carbopol/xanthan interface that moved upward at the velocity of the carbopol plug,(2) no persistent deformation of the interface, or (3) a breakdown of the stable VPL flow characterized by extensive mixing of the core and annular flows. Experiments with the elastic core fluid (PEO) involved introducing multiple pulsed changes (high/low/high, high/low/high, .) in the core flow to an established VPL flow. These pulsed changes typically produced linked multiple diamond shaped stable deformations ("diamond necklace") in the interface that moved upwards at the velocity of the carbopol plug. The frequency and amplitude (maximum radius) of the diamond deformations could be controlled by the timing of pulses and the respective flow rates, but not the diamond shape itself which appears to be a consequence of the complex rheology of the fluids.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The topological Casimir effect on a torus</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>van Caspel, Moos</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The conventional Casimir effect manifests itself as a quantum mechanical force between two plates, that arises from the quantization of the electromagnetic field in the enclosed vacuum. In this thesis the existence is discussed of an extra, topological term in the Casimir energy at finite temperatures. This topological Casimir effect emerges due to the nontrivial topological features of the gauge theory: the extra energy is the result of tunneling transitions between states that are physically the same but topologically distinct. It becomes apparent when examining, for instance, periodic boundary conditions. I explicitly calculate the new term for the simplest example of such a system, a Euclidean 4-torus. By dimensional reduction, this system is closely related to two dimensional electromagnetism on a torus, which is well understood. It turns out that the topological term is extremely small compared to the conventional Casimir energy, but that the effect is very sensitive to an external magnetic field. The external field plays the role of a topological theta parameter, analogous to the theta vacuum in Yang-Mills theory. The topological Casimir pressure and the induced magnetic field show a distinctive oscillation as a function of the external field strength, something that can hopefully be observed experimentally.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nonlocally related partial differential equation systems, the nonclassical method and applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yang, Zhengzheng</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Symmetry methods are important in the analysis of differential equation (DE) systems. In this thesis, we focus on two significant topics in symmetry analysis: nonlocally related partial differential equation (PDE) systems and the application of the nonclassical method. In particular, we introduce a new systematic symmetry-based method for constructing nonlocally related PDE systems (inverse potential systems). It is shown that each point symmetry of a given PDE system systematically yields a nonlocally related PDE system. Examples include applications to nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations, nonlinear diffusion equations and nonlinear wave equations. Moreover, it turns out that from these example PDEs, one can obtain nonlocal symmetries (including some previously unknown nonlocal symmetries) from some corresponding constructed inverse potential systems. In addition, we present new results on the correspondence between two potential systems arising from two nontrivial and linearly independent conservation laws (CLs) and the relationships between local symmetries of a PDE system and those of its potential systems. We apply the nonclassical method to obtain new exact solutions of the nonlinear Kompaneets (NLK) equation u_{t}=x^{-²}(x^{⁴}(\alpha u_{x}+\beta u+\gamma u^{ ²}))_{x}, where \alpha&gt;0, \beta\geq0 and \gamma&gt;0 are arbitrary constants. New time-dependent exact solutions for the NLK equation u_{t}=x^{-²}(x^{⁴}(\alpha u_{x}+\gamma u^{²}))_{x}, for arbitrary constants \alpha&gt;0, \gamma&gt;0 are obtained. Each of these solutions is expressed in terms of elementary functions. We also consider the behaviours of these new solutions for initial conditions of physical interest. More specifically, three of these families of solutions exhibit quiescent behaviour and the other two families of solutions exhibit blow-up behaviour in finite time. Consequently, it turns out that the corresponding nontrivial stationary solutions are unstable.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Transport and dispersion of particles in visco-plastic fluids</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hormozi, Sarah</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis focuses on development of a model to predict “spreading” of the solids (i.e. proppant) fraction during the fracturing operation. We develop a 1D model that allows us to estimate dispersion of solid particles along a vertical pipe in a fully turbulent flow of a shear thinning yield stress fluid (i.e., visco-plastic fluid), as well as slip relative to the mean flow. In dimensionless form, this results in a quasilinear advection-diffusion equation. Advection by the mean flow, particle settling relative to the mean, in the direction of gravity, turbulent particle dispersivity and Taylor dispersion are the 4 main transport phenomena modelled in the 1D model. We provide a simple analysis of the 1D model, suitable for spreadsheet-type field design purposes, in which we estimate “mixing lengths” due to both settling and dispersion. Secondly, we provide an accurate numerical algorithm for solution of the 1D model and show how pulses of proppant (i.e. slugs) may or may not interact for typical process parameters.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nonlinear amplification techniques for inertial MEMS sensors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sharma, Mrigank</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Inertial sensors, specifically MEMS gyroscopes, suffer in performance with down scaling. Non linear amplification techniques, such as parametric resonance, can be employed in many resonant structures to alleviate this degradation in performance, improve sensitivity and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). In this thesis the application of parametric resonance amplification and damping to both modes of a vibratory gyroscope is carried out using specialized combs. Gap-varying combs, which are usually used for the sensing mode are known for producing electrostatic spring modulations. They are used in this thesis to achieve parametric modulation in sense mode, for increasing spectral selectivity and to reduce the equivalent input noise angular rate (from 0.0046 deg/s/√Hz to 0.0026 deg/s/√Hz , for a parametric gain of 5). Additionally, novel shaped combs were used for performing parametric modulation of the driven mode of a resonant gyroscope as well. Analytical modes for both types of parametric amplification are derived and experimentally verified. In order to study the effect of parametric modulation for large signal operation, the dynamic pull-in process is analyzed and modeled in inertial MEMS sensors. The dynamic analytical model is derived and experimentally verified for parametric amplification. The dependence of dynamic pull-in voltage amplitudes on the values of externally-induced accelerations (e.g. Coriolis accelerations in the case of vibratory gyroscopes) is experimentally. The measurements indicate that the dynamic pull-in voltages reduce from 100 V to 56 V for a designed and fabricated MEMS gyroscope (device A) and from 21.77 V to 17.3 V for a MEMS accelerometer (device B), for an equivalent input acceleration signal of 0.319 ms-2, when the structures are actuated at their resonance frequency. In order to further analyze the fundamental limitations of sensing at microscale, a separate noise analysis of MEMS resonant sensors is performed. The frequency-dependent damping theory is used to suggest new optimization methods for the design of MEMS vibratory gyroscopes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Empirical in-stream flow assessment tools for British Columbian channels</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>McParland, Daniel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Empirical hydraulic distribution equations have been proposed as simple and inexpensive alternatives to traditional data-intensive flow assessment methodologies. Two proposed depth and three proposed velocity empirical equations were compared to measured hdraulic distributions for two channels in the Interior Region of British Columbia. Empirical velocity distributions adequately reproduced the measured velocity distribution for both channels. An empirical depth distribution was able to replicate measured depth distributions at a relatively undisturbed channel (Harris Creek) but were unable to predict the measured depth distribution following morphological change at a channel recently disturbed by forest fire (Fishtrap Creek). Furthermore, the empirical distributions were compared to modelled depth and velocity distributions produced by a 2-dimensional hydrodynamic model (River2D). The empirical distributions provided reasonable representation of the hydraulic distributions for flows &lt; 3 m³ s-¹. At flows approaching bankfull the empirical methods, in particular the velocity equations, were unable to adequately reproduce the distributions produced in River2D. Additionally, a joint frequency depth-velocity distribution was paired with habitat suitability indices to quantify available habitat across a range of flows at Harris Creek using reach average hydraulic conditions generated by River2D. The statistical habitat model produced similar habitat values to River2D at low flows and was able to recreate the general shape and trends of the habitat indices. As well, a proposed at-a-station hydraulic geometry simulator was used alongside a channel regime model to approximate reach average channel conditions at Harris Creek. The proposed hydraulic simulator was able to accurately predict reach average depth (mean error of 1.06 %) and velocity (4.47 %) for discharges ranging from daily low flow to bankfull flow. The hydraulic simulator was coupled with the statistical habitat model to generate hydraulic distributions and subsequently habitat indices for the modelled discharges. The incorporation of the regime models allows users to examine the influence of variable flow regimes and riparian vegetation (inherent of a changing climate) on available aquatic habitat. The proposed aquatic habitat model provides practitioners with a low-input, user-friendly flow assessment tool that can be used for preliminary habitat assessments and basin-wide habitat studies in British Columbia.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Angle-resolved photoemission and density functional theory studies of topological materials</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhu, Zhi-Huai</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Topological insulators (TIs), with a gapless surface state located in a large bulk band gap, define a new class of materials with strong application potential in quantum electronic devices. However, real TI materials have many critical problems, such as bulk conductivity and surface instability, which hinder us from utilizing their exotic topological states. Another fundamental question in the TI field is what the realistic spin texture of the topological surface states (TSSs) is; no conclusive answer has yet been reached, despite extensive studies. We present two studies of doping the prototypical TI materials via in situ potassium deposition at the surface of Bi₂Se₃ and by adding magnetic impurities into the bulk Bi₂Te₃ during crystal growth. We show that potassium deposition can overcome the instability of the surface electronic properties. In addition to accurately setting the carrier concentration, new Rashba-like spin-polarized states are induced, with tunable, reversible, and highly stable spin splitting. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that these Rashba states are derived from quantum well states associated with a K-induced 5 nm confinement potential. The Mn impurities in Bi₂Te₃ have a dramatic effect on tailoring the spin-orbit coupling of the system, manifested by decreasing the size of the bulk band gap even at low concentrations (2%--5%). This result suggests an efficient way to induce a quantum phase transition from TI to trivial insulators. We also explicitly unveil the TSS spin texture in TI materials. By a combination of polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT slab calculations, we find that the surface states are characterized by a layer-dependent entangled spin-orbital texture, which becomes apparent through quantum interference effects. We predict a way to probe the intrinsic spin texture of TSS, and to continuously manipulate the spin polarization of photoelectrons all the way from 0 to +/-100% by an appropriate choice of photon energy and linear polarization. Our spin-resolved ARPES experiment confirms these predictions and establishes a generic rule for the manipulation of photoelectron spin polarization. This work paves a new pathway towards the long-term goal of utilizing TIs for opto-spintronics.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Improving the excitation efficiency of Surface Plasmon Polaritons near small apertures in metallic films</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mehfuz, Reyad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Light incident onto a small aperture in a metal film can convert into light waves bound to the surface of that film. At visible frequencies and beyond, these surface-bound waves are commonly known as surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). In this work, we explore ways to enhance the excitation efficiency of SPPs in the vicinity of a slit aperture. We introduce a basic method to treat this problem in which the slit and adjacent metal surface are approximated as independent waveguides. By mapping out the electromagnetic modes sustained by the waveguide components approximating the slit structure, we predict enhanced SPP excitation efficiency when wave vector matching is achieved between the waveguide modes. The concept of wave vector matching is applied to investigate SPP coupling efficiencies for various slit geometries and material configurations. We consider slits with dimensions comparable to the incident wavelength, categorizing this work into explorations of sub-wavelength and super-wavelength slits. We show that SPP coupling from a sub-wavelength slit can be enhanced by placing a dielectric layer onto the exit side of the metal surface. By varying the layer thickness, it is possible to tune the efficiency of SPP coupling, which can be enhanced significantly (about six times) relative to that without the layer. Broadband enhancement of SPP coupling from a sub-wavelength slit over most of the visible spectrum is also demonstrated using the same method. We also show that high-efficiency SPP coupling can be achieved using a super-wavelength slit. We hypothesize that higher-order modes in a large slit can assist wave vector matching and boost SPP coupling. Enhanced SPP excitation in a slit aperture is first shown using numerical simulations, and later verified with experiments. Overall, the thesis demonstrates that simple wave vector matching conditions, similar to classical SPP coupling methods based on prisms or gratings, can also be applied to describe SPP coupling in small slit apertures. The thesis also provides insights into the role of different parameters, such as slit width, dielectric layer thickness and surrounding dielectric media, in realizing significant enhancements in SPP coupling efficiencies.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Phase coherence in graphene</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lundeberg, Mark Brian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The phase coherent properties of electrons in low temperature graphene are measured and analyzed. I demonstrate that graphene is able to coherently transport spin-polarized electrons over micrometer distances, and prove that magnetic defects in the graphene sheet are responsible for limiting spin transport over longer distances. It is shown that these magnetic defects are also partly responsible for the high decoherence (phase loss) observed at low temperature, and that another (as yet unknown) non-magnetic mechanism is required to explain the remainder. Similar measurements are used to probe and characterize the size scales of the roughness of the graphene sheet. The effects of an in-plane magnetic field threading through the rough graphene sheet are analogous to the effects of the built-in strain; I argue that the observed large valley-dependent scattering rates are a consequence of this built-in strain. I also describe an original, robust technique for extracting coherence information from conductance fluctuations. The technique is demonstrated in experiments on graphene, used to efficiently detect the presence of magnetic defects. This new approach to studying phase coherence can be easily carried over to other mesoscopic semiconducting systems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Studies for the PIENU experiment and on the direct radiative capture of muons in zirconium</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>vom Bruch, Dorothea</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The branching ratio of pions decaying to positrons and muons R = (π→eυ + π→eυγ)/(π→μυ + π→μυγ) has been calculated with very high precision in the Standard Model of particle physics. So far, the theoretical value of R = 1.2352(1) x 10-⁴ is 40 times more precise than the current experimental value of R = 1.230(4) x 10-⁴. To test this variable with respect to deviations from the Standard Model, the experimental precision needs to be improved, which is why the PIENU experiment aims at a precision of less than 10-³, i.e. an improvement of an order of magnitude over the current precision. At this level, mass scales ∼ TeV/c² can be probed for evidence of new pseudo-scalar interactions. The data collected with the experimental setup also allows for a search of sterile neutrinos. When determining the branching ratio, various systematic corrections are applied. The largest among these is due to electro-magnetic shower leakage out of the calorimeters and radiative decays. It was calculated to be (2.25 ± 0.06) % in this thesis. In the second part of the thesis, an experiment on the direct radiative capture of muons in zirconium is described. One theoretical extension to the Standard Model involves a new light and weakly interacting particle in the muon sector which does not conserve parity. This can be studied experimentally with polarized muons that undergo the direct radiative capture into the 2S state of a medium mass target nucleus. During this capture, longitudinal muon polarization is conserved and the muons instantly undergo the 2S-1S transition emitting a second photon. Studying the angular distribution of this second photon indicates whether or not the process is parity violating, which would manifest physics beyond the Standard Model. The direct radiative capture of a muon into an atom in the 1S or 2S state has not been observed yet. Therefore, data was taken in 2012 to study the radiative capture of muons in zirconium. The analysis method of this data set is described with a blind analysis technique.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Charge localization phenomena in correlated oxides</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Comin, Riccardo</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Charge segregation is very common in correlated oxides, spanning from the extreme limit of the Mott insulator, characterized by strong charge localization and suppressed charge dynamics, towards more mildly correlated states of matter, characterized by partial charge reorganization (charge-density-wave). In this thesis work I have investigated how the spatial organization of valence charge evolves with electrostatics (carrier doping) and chemistry (going down in the periodic table). For this reason, the focus is on the experimental study of the strongly-correlated 3d-oxides and the spin-orbit coupled 5d-oxides. These investigations have been performed with a bundle of state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques in the field of quantum materials, namely: angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and optical spectroscopy. To support experimental data, we have used theoretical tools such as conventional density functional theory (DFT) for the 5d-oxides and developed ad-hoc approaches for the more complex 3d-materials. The all-around study of underdoped high-Tc Bi-based cuprates allowed us to shed new light on the universality and origin of charge-ordering instabilities in these materials and understand their interplay with superconductivity and pseudogap. These phenomena have been investigated in detail in underdoped samples of Bi2201, using a various experimental techniques (ARPES, REXS, XRD, LEED, STM) and various tailored theoretical approaches. The results of these studies are presented in Chapters 2 and 3. In the 5d-based iridates (in particular, Na₂IrO₃) we have revealed and characterized a novel form of Mott-Hubbard physics. This has been possible thanks to the combination of ARPES and optics for probing the electronic structure near the Fermi energy, and DFT for providing the theoretical framework to understand the electronic ground state in these materials. Ultimately, this approach helped demonstrate the crucial role of spin-orbit interaction in driving a novel Mott phase in materials where the Mott criterion might be violated (Chapter 4). Altogether, the resulting phenomena discovered in copper- and iridium based oxides have revealed novel unconventional aspects of the physics of correlated materials, thus paving the way for future explorations of the complex but fascinating jungle of transition metal oxides.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Micro-PIV measurement of flow through forming fabrics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Singh, Fatehjit</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis describes an experimental investigation of the flow field upstream of forming fabrics that are typically used in the paper making process. Micro Particle Image Velocimetry was used to measure the velocity distribution upstream of a forming fabric. The velocity upstream of two different types of forming fabrics, namely Monoflex D60TM and IntegraTM, was studied. As expected, the experiments show the existence of a highly variable drainage velocity field upstream of both fabrics. The drainage velocity over the holes can be several times greater than the drainage velocity above the fabric filaments. Since fines and filler tend to follow fluid streamlines, one would therefore expect substantially higher fines and filler concentrations in the holes between the filaments as compared over fabric knuckles. The decay in drainage velocity variations can be represented by the equation Aexp(-Bz/D)+C, where A and B are constant and C is the uncertainty in the experimental setup. D and z represent the fabric’s filament diameter and distance above the fabric surface. It is expected that the response of pulp fibers to the velocity variations caused by the fabric’s weave structure is strongly correlated to their length. The fibers with a length greater than 1.5 mm experience a weighted-average velocity field along their length that is approximately uniform. The deposition of short fibers with length &lt;1500 μm is strongly influenced by the fabric’s weave structure. The experiments also indicate that for fines and filler materials, the different filament diameters and weave patterns among the fabrics are irrelevant since their length scale is smaller than the gap between the fabric filaments. In general, the fabric with finer weave pattern results in more uniform fiber deposition. To study the fiber mat formation, thin layers of fibers were deposited onto the fabric. It was observed that as the grammage increases from 1 g/m² to 5 g/m², the normalized standard variations in drainage velocity field increases from 15% to 61%. The thickness of the boundary region (i.e. the upstream region affected by the disturbance generated by the fabric and fibers) also increases from 1.5D to 3.0D.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An experimental study of fluid flow in a low consistency refiner</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mithrush, Troy Lindsay</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Transport phenomena inside a low consistency disc refiner were experimentally investigated. A transparent refiner door was designed and fabricated with four acrylic viewports enabling plate-scale and groove-scale visual observation. High speed video, ultra-violet fluorescent tracer particles and a MATLAB program were used to perform particle tracking velocimetry to gain further understanding of the flow field. The experimental working fluid under study was water. The effects of refiner operating parameters on the flow field were of particular interest. Refiner flow rates were varied from 300 to 700 litres per minute. Refiner rotational speeds were varied from 400 to 1200 RPM. Plate gap values under study included 7.5, 2.5, 1.5, and 0.75 mm. Two plate configurations were studied, including a smooth rotor and grooved rotor with a machined acrylic stator plate. The plate geometry under test was designed for softwood pulp having a bar edge length equal to 0.99 km/rev. A set of phenomenological characterizations of observed particle behaviour was identified. Qualitative results were provided for the effect of gap, refiner speed, and flow rate on the flow field. Lagrangian pathlines were shown to reveal tortuous flow for grooved rotor experiments. Quantitative results were presented for grooved rotor experiments for gaps of 0.75 mm. Eulerian measurements of groove axial velocity indicated fluid transport into and out of the stator grooves, while net transport occurred out of the grooves. The presence of backflow in the stator grooves was observed at all operating points for the grooved rotor under test. The relationship between stator backflow velocity and operating parameters was reported showing an increase with refiner speed and a minimal decrease with refiner flow rate. It has been shown that there is a linear relationship between stator backflow velocities and the pressure differential across the refiner. Rotational motion in the stator grooves was quantified by angular velocity and turnover rate of the fluid. Turnover rate was defined as the number of rotations of the fluid as it travels the length of the groove. Angular velocity increased proportionally with refiner speed and turnover rate did not vary significantly with refiner operating parameters.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nature of Bose gases near Feshbach resonance : the interplay between few-body and many-body physics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mashayekhi, Mohammad S.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, we investigated the physics of two- and three-dimensional ultra cold Bose gases in the strongly interacting regime at zero temperature. This regime can be experimentally accessed using a Feshbach resonance. We applied a self-consistent diagrammatic approach to determine the chemical potential of three-dimensional Bose gases for a wide range of interaction values. We showed that such strongly interacting Bose gases become unstable towards the formation of molecules at a finite positive scattering length. In fact, the interaction between atoms becomes effectively attractive and the system looses its metastability before reaching the unitary limit. We also found that such systems are nearly fermionized close to the instability point. Near this critical point, the chemical potential reaches a maximum and the contribution to the system energy due to three-body forces is estimated to be only a few percent. We also studied the same system using a self-consistent renormalization group method. This approach confirms the existence of an instability point towards the formation of molecules as well as fermionization. We showed that the instability and accompanying maximum are precursors of the sign change of the effective two-body interaction strength from repulsive to attractive near resonance. In addition, we examined the physics of two-dimensional Bose gases near resonance using a similar self-consistent diagrammatic approach as the one introduced for three-dimensional Bose gases. We demonstrated that a competition between three-body attractive interactions and two-body repulsive forces results in the chemical potential of two-dimensional Bose gases to exhibit a maximum at a critical scattering length beyond which these quantum gases possess a negative compressibility. For larger scattering lengths, the increasingly prominent role played by three-body attractive interactions leads to an onset instability at a second critical value. The three-body effects studied for these systems are universal, fully characterized by the effective two-dimensional scattering length and are, in comparison to the three-dimensional case, independent of three-body ultraviolet physics.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An analysis of the optical response of amorphous semiconductors with distributions of defect states</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chowdhury, Shamsul Azam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Defects play an important role in shaping the optical response of a semiconductor material. In this thesis, models for the spectral dependence of the imaginary part of the dielectric function, for the specific case of defective amorphous semiconductors, are considered. Within the framework of a joint density of states functional analysis, closed-form expressions are derived for the imaginary part of the dielectric function, with defect states taken into account. Both valence band and conduction band defect models are considered in this analysis. The role that the different types of optical transitions play in shaping the corresponding optical response are also closely examined. Using the derived models, the spectral dependence of the optical absorption coefficient is compared with that of experiment for defect absorption influenced samples of amorphous silicon. The fits of these models with the results of experiment are found to be satisfactory.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Effect of geometry on the behavior of steady Newtonian fluid in a multiply connected domain</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Montazer, Mohammad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We start with the prototype problem of flow of a Newtonian fluid in the annular region between two infinitely long circular cylinders, with the given velocity and temperature on the boundaries of the domain. Then we will try to find out how does geometry affect the behavior of the flow inside of the domain. We will explore two invariant mappings K_T and K_psi , such that under appropriate conditions on the boundary, the mapping K_T would preserve solution of temperature field from one domain to another and the mapping k_psi would preserve solution of velocity field. We will prove that if a mapping is conformal, it would preserve the convection-diffusion equation in both domains. After that, we will find which subsets of the conformals would also preserve the velocity field as well. In order to answer that question, we will obtain the required condition for the mapping , such that it would preserve both velocity and temperature fields, from one domain to another.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Simulation of selected interfacial dynamic problems using Cahn-Hilliard diffuse-interface method</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mehrabian, Hadi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Using the Cahn-Hilliard diffuse-interface model, I have studied three interfacial dynamic problems for incompressible immiscible two-phase flows. As the first problem, capillary instability of a liquid torus is computed. The main differences between the torus and a straight thread are the presence of an axial curvature and an external flow field caused by the retraction of the torus. We show that the capillary wave initially grows linearly as on a straight thread. The axial curvature decreases the growth rate of the capillary waves while the external flow enhances it. Breakup depends on the competition of two time scales: one for torus retraction and the other for neck pinch-off. The outcome is determined by the initial amplitude of the disturbance, the thickness of the torus relative to its circumference, and the viscosity ratio. The second problem concerns interfacial dynamics and three-phase contact line motion of wicking through micropores of two types of geometries: axisymmetric tubes with contractions and expansions of the cross section, and two-dimensional planar channels with a Y-shaped bifurcation. Results show that the liquid meniscus undergoes complex deformation during its passage through contraction and expansion. Pinning of the interface at protruding corners limits the angle of expansion into which wicking is allowed. Capillary competition between branches downstream of a Y-shaped bifurcation may result in arrest of wicking in the wider branch. As the third problem, auto-ejection of drops from capillary tubes is studied. This study focuses on two related issues: the critical condition for autoejection, and the role of geometric parameters in the hydrodynamics. From analyzing the dynamics of the meniscus in the straight tube and the nozzle, we develop a criterion for the onset of auto-ejection based on a Weber number defined at the exit of the nozzle and an effective length that encompasses the geometric features of the tube-nozzle combination. In particular, this criterion shows that ejection is not possible in straight tubes. With steeper contraction in the nozzle, we predict two additional regimes of interfacial rupture: rapid ejection of multiple droplets and air bubble entrapment.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Microwave electrodynamics of the high-Tc superconductor Tl2Ba2CuO6+delta</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Aghigh, Seyed Mahyad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The microwave surface resistance, Rs(w,T), and the magnetic penetration depth, ⋋(T), of a rectangular Tl₂Ba₂CuO₆+δ (Tl-2201) single crystal measured along its different crystallographic axes are reported. The measurements of the surface resistance as a function of frequency were made using a precise broadband bolometric technique, and a loop-gap resonator was employed to measure the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth. Disentangling the in- and out-of-plane components of both microwave properties was accomplished by comparing the measurement results obtained for different orientations of the sample with respect to the applied magnetic field, allowing us to report, for the first time, the c-axis components of ∆⋋(T), and Rs(w,T). In particular, our results show a quadratic temperature dependence of ∆⋋c(T) in Tl-2201 which is similar to that in other anisotropic cuprates such as BSCCO, and YBCO. Furthermore, in the case of the surface resistance, a sign change in the curvature of Rc s(w) is observed. The origin of this behavior is not yet understood. The ab-plane components of both microwave properties behave similarly to those reported on other dopings of this material. The measurements of Rs(w,T) and ∆⋋(T) allow us to determine the complex conductivity of this material. Having Tc of 43 K, the sample studied here is in the middle of the overdoped side of the superconducting dome, where very few studies have been made. This particular sample possesses relatively low quasiparticle scattering rates making the interpretation of the measurement results more straightforward. The reliability of the results, current limitations, and further potential progress are also discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantum coherent control and compensation of temporal scattering</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>DeWolf, Timothy</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The experimental work in this thesis is divided into two distinct parts. In both parts, broadband femtosecond laser pulses are "shaped" by adjusting the relative phase and amplitude of spectral components. In the first set of experiments, time-dependent perturbation theory is used to show that the probability of a quantum transition in atomic rubidium can be substantially enhanced or suppressed using pulse shaping, compared to the probability of transition observed when a transform-limited or "flat phase" optical pulse is used. These enhancement or suppression effects are also demonstrated experimentally. As quantum interference (the material phase having been transferred from the optical phase) is used to enhance or diminish a particular final quantum state, this can be classified as a quantum coherent control experiment. In the second set of experiments, an optical pulse is scattered into a train of pulses by a layered structure. The layered structure is used to simulate the effect of optical pulses travelling through certain types of complex media. One consequence of the disruption of a single pulse into a train of pulses is lower per-pulse peak intensity, and thus a greatly diminished nonlinear signal. It is shown that spectral pulse shaping (in phase only) is sufficient to pre-compensate for the scattering structure, allowing a single transform-limited pulse to be obtained at the output.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Molecular beam epitaxy growth technology and properties of GaAsBi alloys</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lewis, Ryan B.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technology and the MBE growth of GaAsBi are investigated. MBE is a non-equilibrium technique whereby precisely controlled molecular beams are deposited onto a heated substrate at temperatures much lower than for equilibrium growth techniques. A novel closed-cycle cooling setup is implemented to replace liquid nitrogen (LN₂) cooling of the MBE cryo-shroud. The temperature dependence of cryopanel pumping is explored, and GaAs and AlGaAs layers grown using the new cooling setup and with LN₂ cooling of the shroud are characterized. Strong AlGaAs photoluminescence and low impurity concentrations indicate closed-cycle cooling is a promising cost-saving technique for MBE. The relatively unexplored III-V-Bi family of alloys is an exciting frontier of III-V semiconductor alloy exploration. The GaAsBi alloy exhibits many novel properties, including an unparalleled bandgap reduction per change in the size of the crystal lattice, presenting a wide range of potential device applications. A systematic study of the dependence of Bi incorporation on MBE growth conditions is presented. Bi incorporation is found to rapidly increase as the As₂:Ga flux ratio is lowered to 0.5 and saturate for lower flux ratios. This indicates Bi incorporation is sensitive to the surface stoichiometry. A GaAsBi growth model is proposed where Bi from a wetting layer incorporates on surface sites which are terminated by Ga. Low growth temperatures are required as the weak Bi-Ga incorporation bond can be broken thermally, ejecting Bi back to the wetting layer. GaAsBi layers with up to 21.8% Bi, record Bi-content, were grown at temperatures as low as 200C. These layers have up to 2.6% mismatch from the GaAs substrates and show unusually large critical thicknesses for relaxation, a result of the low growth temperature. Optical absorption measurements on pseudomorphic GaAsBi layers with up to 18.7% Bi show the bandgap decreases strongly with increasing Bi-content, reaching 0.5 eV at 18.7% Bi. Si-doped n-GaAsBi layers with up to 4% Bi show the concentration of acceptor states increases rapidly with increasing Bi-content. The acceptor concentration is equal to that of closed Bi3 clusters, suggesting they are the source of deep acceptor states in GaAsBi.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A search for supersymmetry and universal extra dimensions in final states with three leptons and missing transverse momentum in 20.7 inverse femtobarns of 8 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>King, Samuel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This dissertation presents a search for direct production of charginos and neutralinos in final states with three leptons and missing transverse momentum in 20.7 inverse femtobarns of 8 TeV (center of mass) proton-proton collisions delivered by the Large Hadron Collider and collected with the ATLAS detector. The Standard Model augmented with the minimal formulation of universal extra dimensions (MUED) is phenomenologically similar to supersymmetry. This search is also sensitive to MUED cascades characterized by the presence of n=1 Kaluza-Klein excitations of Standard Model W and Z bosons. No significant excess over Standard Model predictions is observed. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified supersymmetric models and MUED. New limits are set at the 95% confidence level on the parameter spaces of these models.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Implementation of a coherent Lyman-alpha source for laser cooling and spectroscopy of antihydrogen</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Michan, Juan Mario</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This dissertation describes two related projects: the development of a coherent Lyman-α source and the implementation of a supersonic hydrogen beam. A two-photon resonance-enhanced four wave mixing process in krypton is used to generate high power coherent radiation at ωLy_α ⇒ 121.56 nm, the hydrogen Lyman-α line, to perform spectroscopy and cooling of magnetically trapped antihydrogen (1s − 2p transition). This is a tool to directly test both the Einstein Equivalence Principle and Charge, Parity, and Time inversion symmetry. The former can be tested by measuring the gravity interaction of matter and antimatter. Inversion symmetry can be tested by comparing the spectroscopic properties of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Both experiments require optically cooled antihydrogen. Under the current trapping conditions, optical cooling could be performed with nanosecond long pulses of 0.1 μJ of Lyman-α radiation at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The process to generate Lyman-α radiation uses two wavelengths (ωR ⇒ 202.31 nm and ωT ⇒ 602.56 nm), which are mixed in a sum-difference scheme (ωLy_α = 2ωR−ωT ) with a two-photon resonance at (4s²4p⁵5p[1/2]₀ ← 4s²4p⁶(¹S₀) ). The source implemented produces 1.2 μW at the Lyman-α line and this was confirmed by performing spectroscopy of hydrogen. The design, implementation and characterization of the source are discussed in this dissertation. In the second part of the dissertation the implementation of the hydrogen beam and its characterization are discussed. The atomic hydrogen is generated with a thermal effusive source and it is entrained by an expanding noble gas. This process generates a cold beam of hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen is separated from the noble gas with a Zeeman bender that uses the forces generated by the Zeeman shift of low field seeking states of hydrogen and engineered magnetic field gradients. The hydrogen beam was characterized with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The seed noble gas beam was characterized by colliding it with ultra-cold rubidium atoms in a magneto-optical trap. The trapped atoms loss rate resulting from these collisions can be used to measure the density of the atomic beam. This measurement demonstrates the potential of using magneto-optical traps as absolute flux monitors.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Corneal visualization and characterization for applications in ophthalmology using optical imaging</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lai, Tom Yu Chia</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are two modalities suitable for imaging corneas. MPM is a nonlinear optical imaging technique that has sub-micron spatial resolution, deep penetration, and excellent optical-sectioning capability. It can detect two contrasts simultaneously: two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and second harmonic generation (SHG). TPEF and SHG are used to visualize cells and collagen fibers, respectively. On the other hand, OCT is based on the detection of single-backscattered light using interferometry principles. Generally, it has micrometer-resolution and up to a few millimeters of imaging-depth. Combining MPM and OCT for corneal imaging is intuitive in the current study as the complementary information obtained from cornea helps us to understand the morphological and physiological status of the cornea. Furthermore, the MPM and OCT images can be used to quantitatively characterize the thicknesses and refractive index (RI) of the major corneal layers. The visualization of the corneal morphology is important in ophthalmology. It can be used to: study the effects of contact lens wear and topical medications; diagnose corneal diseases such as infectious keratitis; and observe corneal ulcers, and keratoconous. In addition, the ability to quantitatively characterize the corneal thickness and RI is valuable for many ophthalmologic applications. These two parameters are useful for laser refractive surgeries, and the diagnosis of corneal degeneration, and endothelial dysfunction. They are also linked to other important parameters such as corneal hydration and intraocular pressure. In this thesis, the capabilities of a combined MPM and OCT system for corneal imaging are demonstrated. Firstly, it is used to simultaneously visualize and compare the morphology, and to characterize the thicknesses and the RI of five different species’ corneas. In order to visualize the thicker tissues, the OCT modality is altered in two ways: a prism-based hardware dispersion balancing unit is added to minimize the dispersion mismatch in OCT; and an additional OCT configuration of objective lens and spectrometer setup was introduced. Secondly, the combined system is used to identify an induced parasitic infection in human corneas. The study serves as an important step forward to bring the combined MPM and OCT technology to clinical settings.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Observation of laminar-turbulent transition of a yield stress fluid in Hagen-Poiseuille flow</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Guzel, Bulent</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The main focus of this work is to investigate experimentally the transition to turbulence of a yield stress shear thinning fluid in Hagen-Poiseuille flow. By combining direct high speed imaging of the flow structures with Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), we provide a systematic description of the different flow regimes from laminar to fully turbulent. Each flow regime is characterized by measurements of the radial velocity, velocity fluctuations, and turbulence intensity profiles. In addition we estimate the autocorrelation, the probability distribution, and the structure functions in an attempt to further characterize transition. For all cases tested, our results indicate that transition occurs only when the Reynolds stresses of the flow equals or exceeds the yield stress of the fluid, i.e. the plug is broken before transition commences. Once in transition and when turbulent, the behavior of the yield stress fluid is somewhat similar to a (simpler) shear thinning fluid. We have also observed the shape of slugs during transition and find that their leading edges to be highly elongated and located off the central axis of the pipe, for the non-Newtonian fluids examined. Finally we present a new phenomenological approach for quantifying laminar-turbulent transition in pipe flow. This criterion is based on averaging a local Reynolds number to give ReG. Our localised parameter shows strong radial variations that are maximal at approximately the radial positions where puffs first appear during the first stages of turbulent transition.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The AdS/CFT correspondence and string theory on the pp-wave</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ramadanovic, Bojan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence are studied in the pp.-wave/BMN limit. We use the light cone string field theory to investigate energy shifts of the one and two impurity states. In the case of two impurity states we find that logarithmic divergences, in the sums of intermediate states, actually cancel out between the Hamiltonian and a Q-dependent contact term”. We show how non-perturbative terms, that have previously plagued this theory, vanish as a consequence of this cancelation. We argue from this that every order of internal impurities contributes to the overall energy shift and attempt to give a systematic way of calculating such sums for the case of the simplest 3-string vertex (one proposed by diVecchia). We extend our analysis of the mass shift to the case of the most advanced 3-string vertex (proposed by Dobashi and Yoneya). We find agreement between our string field theory calculations and the leading order CFT result in the BMN limit. We also find strong similarities between our result and higher orders in the field theory, including, on the string side, the disappearance of the half-integer powers which generically do not exist in the field theory calculations. We also study the orbifolding of the pp-wave background which results in the discrete quantization of the light-cone momentum. We present the string field theory calculation for such a discreet momentum case. We also observe how a particular choice of the orbifold, results in the string theory corresponding to the quantization of the finite size giant magnon on the CFT side. We study this theory in detail with particular emphasis on its super algebra.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Cosmological recombination</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wong, Wan Yan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis we focus on studying the physics of cosmological recombination and how the details of recombination affect the Cosmic Microwave Back ground (CMB) anisotropies. We present a detailed calculation of the spectral line distortions on the CMB spectrum arising from the Ly α and two-photon transitions in the recombination of hydrogen (H), as well as the corresponding lines from helium (He). The peak of these distortions mainly comes from the Ly α transition and occurs at about 170 μm, which is the Wien part of the CMB. The detection of this distortion would provide the most direct supporting evidence that the Universe was indeed once a plasma. The major theoretical limitation for extracting cosmological parameters from the CMB sky lies in the precision with which we can calculate the cosmologi cal recombination process. Uncertainty in the details of hydrogen and helium recombination could effectively increase the errors or bias the values of the cos mological parameters derived from microwave anisotropy experiments. With this motivation, we perform a multi-level calculation of the recombination of H and He with the addition of the spin-forbidden transition for neutral helium (He I), plus the higher order two-photon transitions for H and among singlet states of He I. Here, we relax the thermal equilibrium assumption among the higher excited states to investigate the effect of these extra forbidden transitions on the ionization fraction Xe and the CMB angular power spectrum C. We find that the inclusion of the spin-forbidden transition results in more than a percent change in Xe, while the higher order non-resonance two-photon transitions give much smaller effects compared with previous studies. Lastly we modify the cosmological recombination code RECFAST by introduc ing one more parameter to reproduce recent numerical results for the speed-up of helium recombination. Together with the existing hydrogen ‘fudge factor’, we vary these two parameters to account for the remaining dominant uncertainties in cosmological recombination. By using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with Planck forecast data, we find that we need to determine the parameters to better than 10% for HeT and 1% for H, in order to obtain negligible effects on the cosmological parameters.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Using refractive index to monitor oil quality in high voltage transformers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kisch, Ryan John</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Insuring reliable operation of high voltage electrical equipment, such as transformers and cables, is of great importance to the power industry. This is done by monitoring the equipment. A large portion of this monitoring includes analyzing the quality of the insulating oils and observing various compounds formed in the oils during aging. Most often, transformer monitoring includes routine oil sampling and analysis, which has proven to be very effective at diagnosing faults and determining the insulation condition. Many techniques have been demonstrated for the purpose of online monitoring, and various commercial products are available. However, utility companies are still looking for more cost effective methods to monitor their equipment between sampling intervals. The work presented here was performed in order to investigate the use of refractive index for monitoring insulating oils. The refractive indices of various oil samples obtained from the field were measured and differences were observed. Accelerated aging experiments were conducted in a laboratory and increases in the refractive indices of these artificially aged oils were observed. Experiments were conducted to determine what by-products would contribute to this increased refractive index by investigating the effects of individual groups on the refractive index change. These groups included aromatic compounds, polar compounds, furans, acid, and fault gases. We observe that the formation of furans, acids, and fault gases cannot be detected using refractive index for the concentrations typically found in the field. We conclude that changes in the refractive index of an oil can be used as an indicator of the oil’s aging and its break down and the formation of aromatic and polar compounds.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>GaAs₁₋xBix light emitting diodes : a new long wavelength semiconductor light source</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lewis, Ryan B.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>GaAs₁₋xBix is an exciting new semiconductor material, which has been pro posed as a new material for infrared light emitting devices. Recent ad vancements in the growth of GaAs₁₋xBix films have made it possible to produce GaAs₁₋xBix light emitting diodes for the first time. Throughout this research we have grown, fabricated and characterized GaAs₁₋xBix light emitting diodes. Similarly structured InxGa₁₋xAs light emitting diodes were also produced and characterized for comparison to the GaAs₁₋xBix devices. Strong electroluminescence was obtained from GaAs₁₋xBix devices, showing two emission peaks, one corresponding to the GaAs₁₋xBix layer and the other to the GaAs cladding. Emission from InxGa₁₋x_As devices was about 100 times brighter than from GaAs₁₋xBix devices. Temperature dependent electroluminescence and photoluminescence measurements of a GaAs₁₋xBix light emitting diode were made and showed some unusual results. The wavelength of the peak in the electroluminescence from the GaAs₁₋xBix was independent of temperature in the range 100 K to 300 K while the GaAs peak shifted with temperature as expected. Photoluminescence measurements on the same structure show temperature dependence of the peak wavelength similar to the temperature dependence of GaAs.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Improving attenuation corrections obtained using singles-mode transmission data in small-animal PET</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Vandervoort, Eric</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The images in positron emission tomography (PET) represent three dimensional dynamic distributions of biologically interesting molecules labelled with positron emitting radionuclides (radiotracers). Spatial localisation of the radio-tracers is achieved by detecting in coincidence two collinear photons which are emitted when the positron annihilates with an ordinary electron. In order to obtain quantitatively accurate images in PET, it is necessary to correct for the effects of photon attenuation within the subject being imaged. These corrections can be obtained using singles-mode photon transmission scanning. Although suitable for small animal PET, these scans are subject to high amounts of contamination from scattered photons. Currently, no accurate correction exists to account for scatter in these data. The primary purpose of this work was to implement and validate an analytical scatter correction for PET transmission scanning. In order to isolate the effects of scatter, we developed a simulation tool which was validated using experimental transmission data. We then presented an analytical scatter correction for singles-mode transmission data in PET. We compared our scatter correction data with the previously validated simulation data for uniform and non-uniform phantoms and for two different transmission source radionuclides. Our scatter calculation correctly predicted the contribution from scattered photons to the simulated data for all phantoms and both transmission sources. We then applied our scatter correction as part of an iterative reconstruction algorithm for simulated and experimental PET transmission data for uniform and non-uniform phantoms. We also tested our reconstruction and scatter correction procedure using transmission data for several animal studies (mice, rats and primates). For all studies considered, we found that the average reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients for water or soft-tissue regions of interest agreed with expected values to within 4%. Using a 2.2 GHz processor, the scatter correction required between 6 to 27 minutes of CPU time (without any code optimisation) depending on the phantom size and source used. This extra calculation time does not seem unreasonable considering that, without scatter corrections, errors in the reconstructed attenuation coefficients were between 18 to 45% depending on the phantom size and transmission source used.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Limitations on tidal-in-stream power generation in a strait</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Atwater, Joel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the quest to reduce the release of carbon dioxide to limit the effects of global climate change, tidal-in-stream energy is being investigated as one of many possible sustainable means of generating electricity. In this scheme, turbines are placed in a tidal flow and kinetic energy is extracted. With the goal of producing maximum power, there is an ideal amount of resistance these turbines should provide; too little resistance will not a develop a sufficient pressure differential, while too much resistance will choke the flow. Tidal flow in a strait is driven by the difference in sea-level along the channel and is impeded by friction; the interplay between the driving and resistive forces determines the flow rate and thus the extractible power. The use of kinetic energy flux, previously employed as a metric for extractible power, is found to be unreliable as it does not account for the increased resistance the turbines provide in retarding the flow. The limits on extraction from a channel are dependant on the relationship between head loss and velocity. If head loss increases with the square of the velocity, a maximum of 38% of the total fluid power may be extracted; this maximum decreases to 25\% if head loss increases linearly with velocity. Using these values, the estimated power potential of BC's Inside Passage is 477MW, 13% of previous assessments. If a flow has the ability to divert through a parallel channel around the installed turbines, there are further limits on production. The magnitude of this diversion is a function of the relative resistance of impeded and diversion channels. As power extraction increases, the flow will slow from its natural rate. This reduction in velocity precipitously decreases the power density the flow, requiring additional turbine area per unit of power. As such, the infrastructure costs per watt may rise five to eight times as additional turbines are installed. This places significant economic limitations on utility-scale tidal energy production.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Gravitational waves from a string cusp in Einstein-aether theory</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The motivation of this thesis is to look for a signature of Lorentz violation, hopefully observable, in the gravitational waves emitted by cosmic strings. Aspects of cosmic strings are reviewed, in particular how focused bursts of gravitational radiation are emitted when a cusp forms on the string. The same phenomenon is then studied in an effective field theory with Lorentz violation called Einstein-aether theory. This is a simple theory with a dynamic preferred frame, but it retains rotational and diffeomorphism invariance. The linearized version of the theory produces five wave modes. We study the usual transverse traceless modes which now have a wave speed that can be lower or greater than the speed of light. This altered speed produces distinctive features in the waves. They depend on two free parameters: roughly the wave speed and the acceleration of the string cusp. The profile of the wave is analyzed in detail for different values of the parameters and explained by close comparison with the string motion.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Yaghoobi, Parham</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, I will provide an overview of the subject from various experimental and theoretical angles with an emphasis on the limited number of theoretical works that exist in calculating the emission current. I will then present a first-principles calculation of the emission current in a single-walled carbon nanotube using the non-equilibrium Green's function and Fisher-Lee's transmission formulation to describe electronic transport through the system. The simulation results reproduce the trends observed in experimental data closely and, in particular, the current saturation behavior observed in experiments and the deviation from the Fowler-Nordheim behavior. The proposed numerical approach is useful whenever a region of vacuum is present in the device Hamiltonian, which existing commercial transport solvers do not model. To better characterize nanotube electron sources, I have also done some preliminary experimental work, which has involved building equipments and developing recipes for growing carbon nanotubes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Heat transfer near the transition to turbulent fluidization</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Stefanova, Ana</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The turbulent fluidization flow regime, a transitional flow regime situated between bubbling and fast fluidization, has received relatively little attention in the heat transfer literature, despite its advantages for operating commercial gas-solid fluidized bed reactors. This work investigates simultaneously bed–to–surface heat transfer coefficients and changes in the local hydrodynamics near the transition from bubbling to turbulent fluidization flow regimes. Experiments were conducted with fluid cracking catalyst (FCC) and alumina particles in columns of different diameters, a 0.29 m ID column at UBC in Vancouver, Canada, and a 1.56 m ID column at CSIRO Minerals in Clayton, Australia. Radial and axial locations of the heat transfer surface, static bed height and superficial gas velocity were varied. Two distributor configurations were examined in the smaller column: perforated plate and bubble cap. The transition to turbulent fluidization was determined based on changes in trends and features of pressure and optical probes signals. To measure the bed-to-immersed surface heat transfer coefficients, a modular electrically heated vertical tube was designed. The results showed maximum heat transfer coefficients near the onset of turbulent fluidization and increased uniformity of the radial and axial distributions of heat transfer coefficients when the turbulent fluidization regime became dominant. It was discovered that the transition to turbulent fluidization was more complex and occurred gradually across the bed in the larger column. However, the maximum heat transfer coefficient was not affected by the column size. The Froude number, based on the column diameter, provided a good scaling parameter in regions of similar flow structure. A novel transparent heat transfer probe was designed for transient local heat transfer measurement at the column wall and simultaneous evaluation of the hydrodynamics at the heat transfer surface. This study provided insight into the changing dominant mechanism of heat transfer at the onset of turbulent fluidization. A probabilistic heat transfer model was developed, based on the packet renewal theory and the probability of having particle packets corresponding to each hydrodynamic regime at the heat transfer surface. The novelty of the model is the contribution of packets of intermediate voidage, typical for turbulent fluidized beds, to the total heat transfer coefficient.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Tsui, Tyron</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents results from the through-going muon analysis at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. Over 1229.26 days, 77376 direct cosmic ray muons above cosθ &gt; 0.4 and 514 neutrino-induced muons in the range -1 &lt; cosθ &lt; 0.4 were detected. A log-likelihood analysis was performed on the neutrino-induced muons to produce a flux measurement and constrain atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters. The best-fit oscillation values were Δm² = (2.6±2.0) × 10⁻³ eV², sin²2θ = 1.0±0.1. The observed muon flux was found to be (2.48±0.25) × 10⁻¹³ cm⁻²s⁻¹sr⁻¹ resulting in an overall flux normalization 1.22±0.09 times the theoretical estimates from the Bartol group. The quoted uncertainties are 1-D marginalized. The no-oscillation hypothesis was ruled out at 99.8% confidence level. The observed number of direct cosmic ray muons was converted into a vertical depth intensity. The resulting fits to the intensity as a function of depth were I₀ = (0.93±0.05) × 10⁻⁶ cm⁻²s⁻¹sr⁻¹, x = 2.33±0.31 km.w.e. and α = 5.62±0.40.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Estimation of grout distribution in a fractured rock by numerical modeling</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rahmani, Helia</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Grouting has been used over the past two centuries to increase the strength, decrease the deformation and reduce the permeability of soils or fractured rocks. Due to its significance in engineering and science predicting grout effectiveness in fractured rocks is of interest. There are different approaches to estimate the effectiveness of grouting, one of which is numerical modeling. Numerical models can simulate distribution of grout inside fractures by which the effectiveness of grout can be estimated. Few numerical studies have been carried out to model grout penetration in fractured rocks. Due to complexities of modeling grout and fracture most of these studies have either used simplifying assumptions or been bound to small sizes of fractures, both resulting in unrealistic simulations. The current work aims to eliminates some of the simplifying assumptions and develop a model that can improve the reliability of the results. In reality grouts are believed to behave as a Bingham fluid, but many models do not consider a full Bingham fluid flow solution due to its complexity. Also, real fractures have rough surfaces with randomly varying apertures. However, some models consider fractures as planes with two parallel sides and a constant aperture. In the current work the Bingham fluid flow equation are solved numerically over a stochastically varying aperture fracture. To simplify the equations and decrease the computational time the current model substitutes two-dimensional elements by one-dimensional pipes with equivalent properties. The model is capable of simulating the time penetration of grout in a mesh of fracture over a rather long period of time. The results of the model can be used to predict the grout penetration for different conditions of fractures or grout.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>New constraints on Mercury's internal magnetic field</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Uno, Hideharu</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Three-component vector magnetic field observations from MESSENGER’s first two flybys of Mercury have confirmed the presence of an internal field, along with external fields related to magnetospheric current systems. We use techniques in inverse theory to investigate structure in Mercury’s inter nal magnetic field permitted by the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER flyby data, and structures recoverable while spacecraft is in orbit. We remove external fields predicted by a parameterized magnetospheric model from the flyby observations. We estimate noise contributions from long-wavelength uncertainties in the external field and from un-modeled short-wavelength features. Internal field models are parameterized to spherical harmonic degree and order 8, with regularization constraints applied to the power spectrum. The field is predominantly dipolar but additional latitudinal and longitudinal structure is required to fit the data. Enhanced radial magnetic field in the region of the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER flybys latitudes is seen. Contributions to the internal field predicted by Aharonson and others for a long-wavelength crustal field are present (namely, the g⁰₁, g⁰₃, and g²₃ spherical harmonic coefficients), but our hypothesis testing has shown that the field is dominated by the g⁰₁ term rather than the proposed g⁰₃ term. Further hypothesis testing has determined that the dipole tilt of Mercury is in the range of 30 to 13° with 13° as a strict upper bound. Observations from the upcoming MESSENGER flyby will provide additional, and critical, low-latitude coverage. Analyses of flyby data have shown that much of the recovery internal field depends successfully characterizing the external field signatures that are present in the data. Currently, the limited ninnber of ob servations prevents us from constructing a reliable external field model, but these external field models will improve as data becomes more abundant. We also investigate recovery of three simulated core fields using synthetic data during MESSENGER’s orbital phase, under the assumption that long wavelength external fields can be modeled and removed. The results show excellent recovery of the dipole field and of field structure at mid-northern to high latitudes out to degree and order 10, providing encouraging results for future identification and characterization of core fields.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Aspects of SU(2|4) symmetric field theories and the Lin-Maldacena geometries</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>van Anders, Greg</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Gauge/gravity duality is an important tool for learning about strongly coupled gauge theories. This thesis explores a set of examples of this duality in which the field theories have SU(2|4) supersymmetry and discrete sets of vacuum solutions. Specifically, we use the duality to propose Lagrangian definitions of type IIA Little String Theory on S⁵ as double-scaling limits of the Plane-Wave Matrix Model, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R x S² and N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R×S³/Zk. We find the supergravity solutions dual to generic vacua of the Plane-Wave Matrix Model and maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R×S². We use the supergravity duals to calculate new instanton amplitudes for the Plane-Wave Matrix Model at strong coupling. Finally, we study a natural coarse-graining of the vacua, and find that the associated geometries are singular. We define an entropy functional that vanishes for regular geometries, is non-zero for singular geometries, and is maximized by the thermal state.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dynamical correlations of S=1/2 quantum spin chains</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pereira, Rodrigo Gonçalves</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Spin-1/2 chains demonstrate some of the striking effects of interactions and quantum fluctuations in one-dimensional systems. The XXZ model has been used to study the unusual properties of anisotropic spin chains in an external magnetic field. The zero temperature phase diagram for this model exhibits a critical or quasi-long-range-ordered phase which is a realization of a Luttinger liquid. While many static properties of spin-1/2 chains have been explained by combinations of analytical techniques such as bosonization and Bethe ansatz, the standard approach fails in the calculation of some time-dependent correlation functions. I present a study of the longitudinal dynamical structure factor for the XXZ model in the critical regime. I show that an approximation for the line shape of the dynamical structure factor in the limit of small momentum transfer can be obtained by going beyond the Luttinger model and treating irrelevant operators associated with band curvature effects. This approach is able to describe the width of the on-shell peak and the high-frequency tail at finite magnetic field. Integrability is shown to affect the low-energy effective model at zero field, with consequences for the line shape. The power-law singularities at the thresholds of the particle-hole continuum are investigated using an analogy with the X-ray edge problem. Using methods of Bethe ansatz and conformal field theory, I compute the exact exponents for the edge singularities of the dynamical structure factor. The same methods are used to study the long-time asymptotic behavior of the spin self-correlation function, which is shown to be dominated by a high-energy excitation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Searches for top-antitop resonances in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lessard, Jean-Raphael</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The LHC and the ATLAS detector offer an unprecedented opportunity to test theories beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Some of these theories predict heavy particles that would decay predominantly into a top and an antitop quark. This thesis presents a technique to experimentally measure the invariant mass (Mtt) of top-antitop pairs, event-by-event, allowing for a complete reconstruction of the Mtt spectrum. Two different models of heavy narrow resonances were considered: a particle X with a negligible mass width, and a Z' particle. Under these models, no resonances in the Mtt spectrum were found in 35.3 pb-1 of 7 TeV centre of mass proton-proton collision data. An upper limit on the production cross section times the branching ratio of the heavy particle decaying into a top-antitop (Sup) as a function of its mass (Mx or Mz) was established at a 95% confidence level. Including systematic errors, the observed (expected) Sup at 95% varies from 3.2 pb (27.9 +11.3 -19.9 pb) to 77.7 pb (9.8 +10.7 -5.6 pb) for Mx ranging from 760 GeV to 1000 GeV, and from 2.9 pb (55.9 +56.9 -47.0 pb) to 43.4 pb (7.8 +8.9 -4.7 pb) for Mz ranging from 700 GeV to 1000 GeV. ; Graduate</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Parameterizing the breaking and scattering of a mode-1 internal tide on abrupt step topography</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Murowinski, Emma Christina</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A parameterization is presented for turbulence dissipation due to baroclinic tide impacting on abrupt shelf topography that is supercritical with respect to the tide. The parameterization requires knowledge of the topography, stratification, and the remote forcing velocity. Upon impact, the tide cascades to higher vertical modes. Vertical internal modes that are arrested at the crest of the topography in the form of lee waves are assumed to dissipate, while faster modes are assumed to propagate away. The energy flux in each mode is predicted with topography that allows linear numer- ical solutions. The parameterization is tested using high-resolution two-dimensional numerical models of baroclinic tides impinging on an isolated shelf of various heights approximated as a step-function. The recipe is seen to work well compared to numeri- cal simulations of isolated shelves, although it consistently underestimates model flux divergence. Despite low forcing velocities having a more accurate numerical linear solution, the recipe does poorly because it does not accurately predict the modes that become trapped and dissipate. Maximum dissipation occurs when flow is on-shelf and lee waves form, indicating lee waves are the mechanism by which dissipation occurs. ; Graduate ; 0415</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Photoluminescence and X-ray Diffraction Analyses of Cadmium Zinc Telluride Crystals</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jamnejad, Ramin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis present photoluminescence spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses of four different cadmium zinc telluride samples with different quality and features and similar zinc molar concentration of 10%. Photoluminescence spectroscopy of the samples let us obtain several physical parameters of the samples which are indicators of quality, composition, structure, and impurity levels of the samples. The band gap energy of the samples obtained from the photoluminescence spectra at low temperatures helped us to estimate zinc molar concentration of the samples. Temperature dependence of band gap energy in these samples has been analyzed and exciton-LO phonon interactions in the samples has been analyzed. From temperature dependence of full width at half maximum of the photoluminescence peak several parameters including concentration of impurity centers and inhomogeneity of the samples are determined and compared in order to check the quality of the samples. Thermal quenching of the photoluminescence peak has been analyzed and the processes which are associated with each parameter are determined and discussed. X-ray diffraction analyses of the sample for the location and width of the peaks have been analyzed and several characteristics of the samples including quality, lattice constant and zinc molar concentration of the samples are determined and compared. The parameters that are obtained from these analyses are compared with the ones from the photoluminescence spectra and showed a good agreement between the results of these two non-destructive characterization techniques. ; Graduate ; 0605 ; 0544 ; 0794</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental study of the development flow region on stepped chutes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Murillo Munoz, Rafael Eduardo</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The development flow region of stepped chutes was studied experimentally. Three configuration of chute bed slopes 3.5H:1V, 5H:1V, and 10H:1V were used to study the flow characteristics. Each model had five horizontal steps and with constant step height of 15 cm. Constant temperature anemometry was used to investigate the velocity field characteristics as well as local void fraction. Pressure transducers were used to examine the pressure distribution. The conditions of aerated and non-aerated cavity were studied. It was found that the temperature anemometry is a valuable tool in the study of water flow problems due to its good spatial and temporal resolution. It is recommended that the constant overheat ratio procedure should be used in dealing with non-isothermal water flows. Flow conditions along the development flow region were found to be quite complex with abrupt changes between steps depending whether or not the flow jet has disintegrated. The flow on this region does not resemble a drop structure and after the first step, the step cavity condition does not affect the flow parameters. Pressure distribution was also found to be complex. It was found that there are no conclusive pressure profiles either on the step treads nor on step risers. No correlation was observed with the values of pool depth. The instantaneous characteristics of the velocity field along the jet of a drop structure were also studied. It was concluded that the cavity condition does not affect the velocity field of the sliding jet. The shear stress layer at the jet/pool interface was quantified.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Cheng, Kar Mun</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, an adapted form of dynamic Electrostatic Force Microscopy is presented as an alternative technique for non-contact dynamic characterization of beam resonators. The actuation of the test resonant beam was accomplished by applying a modulated signal to a probe cantilever that was positioned closely above the resonant beam. The frequency response of the coupled electrostatic interaction between the conductive beams was studied close to the resonance of the test beams. Modulation of the input signal allowed the test resonator to be actuated without requiring on-chip circuitry, and the probing frequency range kept independent of the resonant frequency of the probe cantilever. The resonant response of three test cantilever beams were experimentally characterized using two softer probe cantilevers. A model was constructed to describe the coupled electrostatic interaction and simulations were performed to compare predictions from the model to experimental data. The amplitude response shape, resonant frequency and quality factor from the model fit well with experimental results, showing that the resonant response of a resonator can be characterized using this technique. However, the phase and voltage variation responses were not well characterized, indicating further work to develop the force expressions in the model is needed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Interpreting wave propagation in a homogeneous, isotropic, steel cylinder</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Stoyko, Darryl Keith</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The majority of commercially available ultrasonic transducers used to excite and measure wave propagation in structures can be coupled only to a free surface. While convenient, this method is likely to excite multiple structural modes, making data interpretation difficult. Furthermore, the many modes excited make predicting the structure’s response a computationally intensive task. Here the dynamic radial displacement induced by a transient radial point load is calculated at more than 230,000 points on the outer surface of a virgin steel pipe to simulate a typical experiment. The radial component of the displacement field is calculated by convolving the Green’s functions of the pipe with the transient load. These functions are calculated on personal computers (in a distributed arrangement) by employing modal summation. The mode shapes are obtained from a Semi-Analytical Finite Element formulation used in conjunction with a separation of variables. The results are presented in a four dimensional animation, providing easier interpretations and insight into how to best select observation points for the detection of defects. The accuracy of the calculated displacements is verified experimentally. Agreement is good when magnitude and phase corrections are incorporated from the frequency response curves of the transducers used.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A comparison of imaging methods using GPR for landmine detection and a preliminary investigation into the SEM for identification of buried objects</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gilmore, Colin G.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Part I: Various image reconstruction algorithms used for subsurface targets are reviewed. It is shown how some approximate wavefield inversion techniques: Stripmap Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Kirchhoff Migration (KM) and Frequency-Wavenumber (FK) migration are developed from various models for wavefield scattering. The similarities of these techniques are delineated both from a theoretical and practical perspective and it is shown that Stripmap SAR is, computationally, almost identical to FK migration. A plane wave interpretation of both Stripmap SAR and FK migration is used to show why they are so similar. The electromagnetic assumptions made in the image reconstruction algorithms are highlighted. In addition, it is shown that, theoretically, FK and KM are identical. Image reconstruction results for KM, Stripmap SAR and FK are shown for both synthetic and experimental Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data. Subjectively the reconstructed images show little difference, but computationally, Stripmap SAR (and therefore, FK migration) are much more efficient. Part II: A preliminary investigation into the use of the Singularity Expansion Method (SEM) for use in identifying landmines is completed using a Finite-Difference Time-Domain code to simulate a simplified GPR system. The Total Least Squares Matrix Pencil Method (TLS-MPM) is used to determine the complex poles from an arbitrary late-time signal. Both dielectric and metallic targets buried in lossless and lossy half-spaces are considered. Complex poles (resonances) of targets change significantly when the objects are buried in an external medium, and perturbation formulae for Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) and dielectric targets are highlighted and used. These perturbation formulae are developed for homogenous surrounding media, and their utilization for the half-space (layered medium) GPR problem causes inaccuracies in their predictions. The results show that the decay rate (real part) of the complex poles is not suitable for identification in this problem, but that with further research, the resonant frequency (imaginary part) of the complex poles shows promise as an identification feature.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental study of the development flow region on stepped chutes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Murillo Munoz, Rafael Eduardo</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The development flow region of stepped chutes was studied experimentally. Three configuration of chute bed slopes 3.5H:1V, 5H:1V, and 10H:1V were used to study the flow characteristics. Each model had five horizontal steps and with constant step height of 15 cm. Constant temperature anemometry was used to investigate the velocity field characteristics as well as local void fraction. Pressure transducers were used to examine the pressure distribution. The conditions of aerated and non-aerated cavity were studied. It was found that the temperature anemometry is a valuable tool in the study of water flow problems due to its good spatial and temporal resolution. It is recommended that the constant overheat ratio procedure should be used in dealing with non-isothermal water flows. Flow conditions along the development flow region were found to be quite complex with abrupt changes between steps depending whether or not the flow jet has disintegrated. The flow on this region does not resemble a drop structure and after the first step, the step cavity condition does not affect the flow parameters. Pressure distribution was also found to be complex. It was found that there are no conclusive pressure profiles either on the step treads nor on step risers. No correlation was observed with the values of pool depth. The instantaneous characteristics of the velocity field along the jet of a drop structure were also studied. It was concluded that the cavity condition does not affect the velocity field of the sliding jet. The shear stress layer at the jet/pool interface was quantified. ; May 2006</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electrostatic testing of simple MEMS structures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cheng, Kar Mun</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, an adapted form of dynamic Electrostatic Force Microscopy is presented as an alternative technique for non-contact dynamic characterization of beam resonators. The actuation of the test resonant beam was accomplished by applying a modulated signal to a probe cantilever that was positioned closely above the resonant beam. The frequency response of the coupled electrostatic interaction between the conductive beams was studied close to the resonance of the test beams. Modulation of the input signal allowed the test resonator to be actuated without requiring on-chip circuitry, and the probing frequency range kept independent of the resonant frequency of the probe cantilever. The resonant response of three test cantilever beams were experimentally characterized using two softer probe cantilevers. A model was constructed to describe the coupled electrostatic interaction and simulations were performed to compare predictions from the model to experimental data. The amplitude response shape, resonant frequency and quality factor from the model fit well with experimental results, showing that the resonant response of a resonator can be characterized using this technique. However, the phase and voltage variation responses were not well characterized, indicating further work to develop the force expressions in the model is needed. ; October 2006</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Interpreting wave propagation in a homogeneous, isotropic, steel cylinder</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Stoyko, Darryl Keith</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The majority of commercially available ultrasonic transducers used to excite and measure wave propagation in structures can be coupled only to a free surface. While convenient, this method is likely to excite multiple structural modes, making data interpretation difficult. Furthermore, the many modes excited make predicting the structure’s response a computationally intensive task. Here the dynamic radial displacement induced by a transient radial point load is calculated at more than 230,000 points on the outer surface of a virgin steel pipe to simulate a typical experiment. The radial component of the displacement field is calculated by convolving the Green’s functions of the pipe with the transient load. These functions are calculated on personal computers (in a distributed arrangement) by employing modal summation. The mode shapes are obtained from a Semi-Analytical Finite Element formulation used in conjunction with a separation of variables. The results are presented in a four dimensional animation, providing easier interpretations and insight into how to best select observation points for the detection of defects. The accuracy of the calculated displacements is verified experimentally. Agreement is good when magnitude and phase corrections are incorporated from the frequency response curves of the transducers used. ; February 2005</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Azad, Mohammad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Isothermal, incompressible jets of air issuing from sharp-edged isosceles triangular orifices with apex angles of 10°, 20°, 30°, 70° and 160° into still surrounding air, were used to study the effects of apex angle variation on flow development in the jets. Some measurements were made in two round jets issuing from a sharp-edged orifice and from a contoured nozzle. The mean streamwise centreline velocity decay, mass entrainment and spreading results show that the 160° jet, which originates from the orifice with the longest perimeter, has the highest mixing rate in the near flow field. The results also suggest that the 10° jet, which originates from the orifice with the second longest perimeter, has the highest mixing rate in the far field. The results demonstrate that all the triangular jets have higher mixing rates than the round jets, throughout the flow region investigated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>EXPLORING SOLITON AND SIMILARITON FORMATION IN RESONANT OPTICAL MEDIA</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Haghgoo Poorvali, Soodeh</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Investigating the behavior of an atom in response to the applied electric field when the latter frequency is in resonance with the natural frequency of the atom is an interesting subject. Near resonance, some of the most interesting optical phenomena such as dispersion, and absorption are more pronounced. Moreover, considering resonant and near resonant interaction of light with two-level atoms, uncovers fascinating physical phenomena such as area theorem and self-induced transparency describing stable pulse propagation regimes in which the pulses maintain their identity. Existence of these optical structures in on-resonance optical media has not been investigated in detail. In this thesis, the on-resonance interaction of optical field with atoms is considered and the formation of several novel self-similar and kink waves in linear and nonlinear resonant media is discovered and theoretically explored. First, self-similar pulse formation in homogeneous broadened linear amplifiers in a vicinity of an optical resonance is analyzed. It is demonstrated that the self-similar pulses serve as universal asymptotics of any near resonance short pulses propagating in coherent linear amplifiers. Second, ultrashort self-similar pulse propagation in coherent linear absorbers near optical resonance is investigated. Third, existence of self-similar optical waves with kink structure in resonant optical systems is discovered. Fourth, it is found that self-induced transparency quadratic solitons are realizable in the media with quadratic optical nonlinearities, doped with resonant impurities. Finally, stable spatial similaritons supported by homogeneous conservative optical media with quintic nonlinearities are explored. To experimentally realize the presented results, physical models are presented for all systems under consideration. The stability of the proposed near resonance optical systems is demonstrated through a series of numerical case studies.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Volume-Preserving Coordinate Gauges in Linear Perturbation Theory</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Herman, David Leigh</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The main goal of this thesis is to present cosmological perturbation theory (based on the standard Friedmann cosmological model) in volume-preserving coordinates, which then provides a suitable basis for studies in cosmological averaging. We review perturbation theory to second order, allowing for averaging to second order in future research. To solve the averaging problem we need a method of covariantly and gauge invariantly averaging tensorial objects on a background manifold. This is a very difficult problem. However, the definition of an average takes on a particularly simple form when written in a system of volume-preserving coordinates. Therefore, we develop a three dimensional and a four dimensional volume-preserving coordinate gauge in this thesis that can be used for averaging in cosmological perturbation theory.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Observation of the fundamental exciton in low-temperature grown GaAs using four-wave mixing spectroscopy</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Webber, Daniel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The nonlinear optical response of low-temperature (LT) grown GaAs were studied using four-wave mixing techniques. Through measurements of the four-wave mixing response as a function of pulse delay and photon energy, a strong optical response was identi ed associated with the fundamental band gap exciton. These experiments therefore demonstrated the importance of the exciton in understanding the ultrafast nonlinear optical response of LT-GaAs despite the absence of any evidence of the exciton in past linear absorption studies in this material. Measurement of the fourwave mixing response as a function of pulse delay and the polarization states of the two excitation pulses shows that the dominant contribution to the exciton signal is tied to excitation-induced dephasing. Four-wave mixing experiments in which the sample is exposed to an additional laser pulse indicate that the exciton signal may be strongly diminished due to a combination of screening and a reduction in the total dephasing time. The short temporal duration of the above e ect provides evidence of an ultrashort (&lt; 100 fs) electron trapping time in this system tied to arsenic related defects introduced during low-temperature growth. These ndings are of importance to the understanding of the optical properties of LT-GaAs and will aid in the development of optoelectronic devices using this material system.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Self-force on a point particle falling into a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zimmerman, Peter</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>I investigate the electromagnetic self-force on a point charge falling radially into a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. The self-force results from an interaction between a small piece of the radiated field emitted by the particle in its past history that has backscattered off the spacetime curvature and returns to the particle at its current location. To compute the radiation field, I first perform a multipole decomposition of the relevant components of the electromagnetic field strength tensor. I then numerically calculate the field multipoles mode-by-mode using the second-order characteristic scheme of Lousto and Price. The radiation field constructed from the summed modes still contains a local contribution that is formally divergent at the location of the particle. To split the field into divergent and non-divergent pieces, I adopt the Detweiler-Whiting singular-regular decomposition. A regularization mechanism is required to remove the singular piece of the full field in order to obtain the field responsible for the self-force. To regularize the field, I implement the mode-sum method introduced by Barack and Ori. This procedure involves computing the multipole coefficients of the singular field, which leads to the regularization parameters A, B, C, and D. The regularization parameters that represent the singular field involve acceleration terms resulting from the static electromagnetic field sourced by the charged black hole. This is the first self-force computation to incorporate acceleration terms into the regularization parameters. I compute the self-force on a particle starting from rest for a range of charge values of the black hole. This data is used to examine how the self-force behaves as a function of charge. I find that the self-force is repulsive and increases with the black hole's charge.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>LAUE MONOCHROMATOR PERFORMANCE CALCULATIONS FOR A FUTURE CANADIAN LIGHT SOURCE DIFFRACTION BEAMLINE</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Dina, Gabriel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The computational investigation of perfect and bent crystals both cylindrically and sagittaly, have led to the development of sets of optimized parameters to be used for the high energy wiggler beamline monochromator being built at the CLS. Using both Si and Ge in Bragg and Laue geometries, the developed algorithms examine parameter space for most photon flux at the crystal. Using programs in XOP, the calculation analysis for a single incident beam revealed that for symmetric flat crystals the reflection (1,1,1) in the Bragg geometry is most preferable for producing the most throughput at energies below 24keV. For cylindrically bent crystals at energies higher than 24keV, a Laue geometry is more preferred as a result of an increase in the rocking curve width and throughput. Development of a program that calculates the diffracted intensity and energy resolution of a saddle bent crystal with varying asymmetry angles are presented here.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Polymer Dynamics: A Self-Consistent Field-Theoretic Approach</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Grzetic, Doug</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We develop a self-consistent field theory of polymer dynamics, based on a functional integral approach, which is analogous to the existing equilibrium self-consistent field theory for polymers. We apply a saddle-point approximation to the exact dynamical theory, which generates a set of mean-field equations for the time-dependent density and mean force field. We also develop a method of treating the single-chain dynamics exactly, subject to this mean-field, resulting in a functional Fokker-Planck equation that must be solved along with the mean-field equations in a self-consistent manner. To test the self-consistency, we apply the theory to the simple but non-trivial case of np Brownian particles in one dimension interacting via a short-range repulsion in a harmonic external potential. Results for the non-interacting case agree with the literature. The interacting case demonstrates physically sensible interaction-dependent dynamics, such as an increased broadening of the density field when the repulsion is increased. We also examine the dynamics of a binary system with two distinct particle species. We calculate the center-of-mass trajectories for colliding distributions of species A and B, and observe that when the difference of repulsion strengths between like and unlike species chi is greater than a threshold value (between chi = 0.3 and chi = 0.4), the two species do not mix (indicating the onset of phase segregation).</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Structural Characterization of Tetracene Films by Lateral Force Microscopy and Grazing-Incidence X-Ray Diffraction</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tersigni, Andrew</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Organic semiconductors show promise to yield a novel class of bendable electronic devices, and much research efforts have focused on the optimization of these films for device performance. It is well known that the structure of organic films has a large influence over the electronic properties. In particular, the carrier mobility is often highly anisotropic, and domain boundaries have a detrimental effect on charge transport. Therefore the domain structure and lattice orientation are of particular interest. However, little is known about the domain structure of organic films, and techniques to study these properties have only begun to emerge in recent years. In this thesis, we apply two experimental techniques, Grazing-Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXD) and Lateral Force Microscopy (LFM), toward studying the lattice and domain structure of tetracene films grown on the silicon(001)-monohydride surface. We describe the necessary steps toward optimizing the sensitivity of these techniques to the domain structure. Results show that the crystalline tetracene films form a layered morphology in which the a-b plane lies parallel to the substrate surface. The film lattice structure is similar to bulk tetracene, and the lattice is confined to two orthogonal orientations, forming a partially-commensurate relationship with the substrate surface lattice along the film 'a' axis. LFM images reveal two types of polycrystalline domains. The first type ("major domains") are tens of microns in size, and are classified by their lattice orientation. They are subdivided into the second type ("sub-domains"), which range from 0.1 to 5um in size, and are argued to represent regions of uniform molecular tilt direction. The GIXD data show that the single-crystal domains which comprise these two larger domain types are anisotropic in size, being up to two times longer along the film 'b' axis than along 'a'. The single-crystal domains range from 0.05 to 0.2um in size, depending on lattice orientation and film thickness. The mathematical basis for these single-crystal domain size calculations is presented. The single-crystal domain sizes are thickness-dependent, and are two orders of magnitude smaller than a typical surface island observed in atomic-force microscopy (AFM) topographs. Substrate steps can also significantly influence the film structure by inducing boundaries in the single-crystal domains and sub-domains, but not in the major domains. This detailed knowledge of the domain structure of organic thin-films may assist in our understanding of the factors which affect charge transport in thin films, and may help to direct research efforts in optimizing the film structure for device performance. ; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), Ontario Innovation Trust (OIT).</dc:description>

          <dc:title>High-Precision Branching Ratio Measurement for the Superallowed β+ Emitter 74Rb</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Dunlop, Ryan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Precision measurements of superallowed Fermi β-decay allow for stringent tests of the magnitude of isospin-symmetry-breaking effects in nuclei, the validity of the conserved vector current hypothesis, and the unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix. A high-precision measurement of the branching ratio for the superallowed β+ decay of 74Rb has been performed at the Isotope Separator and ACcelerator (ISAC) facility at TRIUMF. The 8π spectrometer, an array of 20 HPGe detectors, was used to detect γ-rays emitted following the Gamow-Teller and non-analogue Fermi β-decays of 74Rb. PACES, an array of 5 Si(Li) detectors, was used to detect emitted conversion electrons, while half of SCEPTAR, a close-packed array of 10 plastic scintillators, was used to detect emitted β particles. In this experiment, 23 excited states were identified in 74Kr which were populated following the β-decay of 74Rb. A total of 58 γ-rays were identified following the 8.241(4)x108 detected β-particles. An observed non-superallowed branching ratio of 0.396(7)% was determined from the intensity of the identified γ-rays, while the unobserved non-superallowed intensity was calculated to be 0.05(5)%, leading to a superallowed branching ratio of 99.55(5)%. The superallowed branching ratio is now the most precise experimental quantity in the determination of the superallowed ft-value of 74Rb. Combining the half-life and Q-value with the superallowed branching ratio measured in this work leads to a superallowed ft-value of 3082.6(66) s. Finally, comparisons between the superallowed ft-value, the world average Ft-value, and the non-analogue Fermi branching ratio are made to provide future guidance in the refinement of the theoretical models required to describe the crucial isospin-symmetry-breaking term in superallowed β-decay.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Rheo-NMR studies of viscoelastic secondary flows in ducts of non-circular cross-section</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Schroeder, Christian Berthold Karl</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The existence of hydrodynamically developed, laminar Viscoelastic Secondary Flows (VSFs) of non-Newtonian fluids in straight ducts of non-circular cross-section was proposed in the 1950's. VSFs have since been observed sporadically, and only once with a velocimetric technique. Using axial and transverse full flow-field velocity-position raster maps made with Rheological Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (Rheo-NMR), Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid flows were quantified in Hagen-Poiseuille and Power Law contexts, over more than two orders of magnitude of flow rate, in ducts of circle, square, triangle, and pentagon cross-section. VSF was reliably and repeatedly observed to occur at between one part in 130 and one part in 600 of the primary axial flow velocity. Velocity measurements ranged from &lt;10 µm/s to approximately 30 cm/s, suggesting a velocity dynamic range &gt;3E4 without optimization. To obtain VSF flow direction information, a novel flow directional phantom was developed and characterized. Aqueous solutions of Polyethylene Oxide (PEO), Viscarin GP-109NF, Viscarin GP-209NF (V209), Hyaluronan (HA) in a Phosphate-Buffered Saline-like solvent, and an aqueous Polyethylene Glycol/PEO-based Boger fluid were investigated. Axial data was corroborated with related data gathered by an independent method. Basic simulations corroborated the VSF observations. Duct hydraulic diameters (&gt;= 1.6 mm) approached the micro-channel regime. VSF detections in HA --- synovial fluid's principal component --- and V209 were novel, as were observations of some artifacts which were subsequently characterized and corrected. The detection of VSF in HA represents the first experimental evidence suggesting that its second normal stress (N_2) is comparable to that of better-characterized fluids. In the first application of a new VSF-based method, a particular Boger fluid's constant viscosity and, in the square duct, its lack of VSF were used with established criteria to suggest that the fluid's N_2 approached zero. The development of a rudimentary, but versatile and inexpensive home-built velocimetric spectrometer is detailed, as are several new components. An exhaustive VSF literature review is included. The remarkable transverse velocimetric ability of Rheo-NMR in both optically opaque and transparent system is highlighted, suggesting that perhaps the technique might represent, in both micro-channels and conventional ducts, the gold-standard in flow velocimetry.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Structure of 152Sm with (d,d') reactions in search of a tetrahedral symmetry signature</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chagnon-Lessard, Sophie</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Nuclei near N=90 and Z=64 have recently been suggested to be `tetrahedral-magic'. One of the main signatures for tetrahedral symmetry is a vanishing quadrupole moment in low-lying negative-parity bands, resulting in very weak or even vanishing E2 matrix elements. With N=90 and Z=62, the transitional nucleus 152Sm is a potential candidate for relatively stable tetrahedral symmetry. Its structure was investigated using deuteron inelastic scattering with a 22 MeV polarized beam at the MP tandem Van de Graaff accelerator of the TU/LMU Munich. The scattered deuterons were momentum analyzed using the Q3D spectrometer. The experimental spectra obtained have allowed the extraction of high-quality differential cross-sections and analyzing powers for levels up to 1.8 MeV. The low-lying negative-parity bands are observed to be strongly populated and the angular distributions associated to their levels exhibit several structural features. The overall agreement is relatively good when considering strong intra-band E2 transitions, but further calculations must be performed to allow precise matrix element extraction. In particular, a simple population pathway test on the 1- state has demonstrated that calculations with vanishing E2 transitions in the negative-parity band are also capable of reproducing its experimental angular distributions. Therefore, the presence of tetrahedral symmetry signature in 152Sm is not excluded. ; This work has been supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nuclear Structure Study of Cd-110 through Internal Conversion Electrons</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jigmeddorj, Badamsambuu</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>For many years, Cd-110 has been considered the classic example of a vibrational nucleus within both the Collective Model and the Interacting Boson Model (IBM). As a vibrational nucleus, Cd-110 exhibits multi-phonon states. Recent studies on other cadmium isotopes have shown a breakdown of vibrational motion at the three-phonon level. The latest study on Cd-112 suggests that some of these excitations may instead result from intruder bands. The study through internal conversion electrons is important to investigate intruder structures in Cd-110, using the enhanced E0 transitions between intruder states and spherical phonon states as a signature. The nuclear structure of Cd-110 has been studied with In-110 beta decay through internal conversion electrons performed at TRIUMF using the 8pi spectrometer. The level scheme of Cd-110 through internal conversion electron transitions was constructed using the electron-gamma coincidence matrix. The sub-shell ratios and multipolarities are determined and compared with the evaluated data set. The absolute internal conversion coefficients for some mixed transitions were determined using an internal calibration efficiency for Si(Li) detector and relative efficiency for HPGe detector. The 396 keV and 708 keV E0 transitions have been observed between intruder and spherical phonon states. The E0 transition strength of 0.115(71) was determined for 708.21 keV line.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An Examination of the Lagrangian Length Scale in Plant Canopies using Field Measurements in an Analytical Lagrangian Equation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Brown, Shannon E</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Studies of trace gas fluxes have advanced the understanding of bulk interactions between the atmosphere and ecosystems. Micrometeorological instrumentation is currently unable to resolve vertical scalar sources and sinks within plant canopies. Inverted analytical Lagrangian equations provide a non-intrusive method to calculate source distributions. These equations are based on Taylor's (1921) description of scalar dispersion, which requires a measure of the degree of correlation between turbulent motions, defined by the Lagrangian length scale (L). Inverse Lagrangian (IL) analyses can be unstable, and the uncertainty in L leads to uncertainty in source predictions. A review of the literature on studies using IL analysis with various scalars in a multitude of canopy types found that parameterizations where L reduces to zero at the ground produce better results in the IL analysis than those that increase closer to the ground, but no individual L parameterization gives better results than any other does. The review also found that the relationship between L and the measurable Eulerian length scale (Le) may be more complex in plant canopies than the linear scaling investigated in boundary layer flows. The magnitude and profile shape of L was investigated within a corn and a forest canopy using field measurements to constrain an analytical Lagrangian equation. Measurements of net CO2 flux, soil-to-atmosphere CO2 flux, and in-canopy profiles of CO2 concentrations provided the information required to solve for L in a global optimization algorithm for half hour intervals. For dates when the corn was a strong CO2 sink, and for the majority of dates for the forest, the optimization frequently located L profiles that follow a convex shape. A constrained optimization then smoothed the profile shape to a sigmoidal equation. Inputting the optimized L profiles in the forward and inverse Lagrangian equations leads to strong correlations between measured and calculated concentrations (corn canopy: C_{calc} = 1.00C_{meas} +52.41 mumol m^{-3}, r^2 = 0.996; forest canopy: C_{calc} = 0.98C_{meas} +276.5 mumol m^{-3}, r^2 = 0.99) and fluxes (corn canopy: F_{soil} = 0.67F_{calc} - 0.12 mumol m^{-2}s^{-1}, r^2 = 0.71, F_{net} = 1.17F_{calc} + 1.97mumol m^{-2}s^{-1}, r^2 = 0.85; forest canopy: F_{soil} = 0.72F_{calc} - 1.92 mumol m^{-2}s^{-1}, r^2 = 0.18, F_{net} = 1.24F_{calc} + 0.65 mumol m^{-2}s^{-1}, r^2 = 0.88). In the corn canopy, coefficients of the sigmoidal equation were specific to each half hour and did not scale with any measured variable. Coefficients of the optimized L equation in the forest canopy scaled weakly with variables related to the stability above the canopy. Plausible L profiles for both canopies were associated with negative bulk Richardson number values. ; Funding from NSERC.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A model of the effects of fluid variation due to body position on Cheyne-Stokes respiration</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wilcox, Marianne</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a distinct breathing pattern consisting of periods of hyperpnea followed by apneas, with unknown etiology. One in two patients with congestive heart failure suffer from this condition. Researchers hypothesize that key factors in CSR are the fluid shift from the standing to supine position and the differences between genders. A mathematical model of the cardio-respiratory system was constructed using parameter values from real data. Hopf bifurcation analysis was used to determine regions of stable versus oscillatory breathing patterns. In the model, Cheyne-Stokes respiration is more likely to occur while in the supine position and males are more likely to develop Cheyne-Stokes than females. These findings, which are in agreement with clinical experience, suggest that both gender and fluid shift contribute to the pathogenesis of Cheyne-Stokes respiration, and that physical quantities such as blood volumes and neural feedback may be sufficient to explain the observations of CSR. ; Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Thermal Transformations and Low Energy Electron Irradiation of 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene on Au(111) Surfaces and on Alkanethiol SAMs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Vandergust, Ann</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis investigates the application of low energy electron irradiation to 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene films to test whether site-selective C–H bond cleavage can be achieved in a molecule presenting both aliphatic and aromatic target sites. IRRAS was used to characterize the orientation of vapour-deposited 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene on Au(111) and alkanethiolated gold under UHV and cryogenic conditions. On both substrates, the disordered as-deposited films were transformed by thermal treatment, producing two film structures – within the first 4-monolayers, aromatic rings lie nearly parallel to the metal surface, while molecules in additional layers are more upright. Low energy electron irradiation (0-10 eV) produced no dissociations in 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene; however, low energy electron transmission spectra indicate charge accumulates at interstitial sites in the mesitylene film, decelerating subsequent incident electrons. These decelerated electrons traverse the charged film and are reaccelerated, inducing dissociations in the underlying SAM. Contrary to literature claims, 1,3,5-trimethylbezene is a poor molecule for adsorption studies such as BET as the initial adsorption is disordered and thermodynamically unstable.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy of Ultrathin Nickel Silicide Films: A Theoretical and Experimental Investigation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Arthur, Zachary</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Previous studies have attempted to probe the structure of ultra-thin Nickel silicide films as they evolve in the manufacturing process with limited success. These studies have used ultra-thin Nickel silicide films that were quenched during the manufacturer's annealing process at select temperatures. This study aims to determine the structure of quenched ultra-thin Ni-Si films using Grazing Incidence X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (GI-XANES) and ab-initio calculations (FDMNES). Successful calculations were prepared for the δ and θ Ni2Si phases, as well as the Ni3Si2, NiSi and NiSi2 phases. The GI-XANES experimental data was taken at the Canadian Light Source, at the Hard X-Ray Microanalysis Beamline (HXMA). XANES and FDMNES are used to identify two phases of the ultra-thin films: the as-deposited phase as a low-ordered Ni3Si2 phase, and the epitaxial NiSi2 phase was found in samples annealed past 400˚C.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The static self-force in Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter spacetimes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kuchar, Joseph</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>I investigate the self-force acting on static scalar and electric charges in Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter spacetimes. The self-force occurs when a charged particle's field interacts with the curvature of spacetime so that the particle interacts with its own field. Because the field of a point particle is singular at the location of the particle, it is necessary to decompose the field into a regular part responsible for the self-force and a singular part that does not contribute to the self-force. To do this, I use the mode-sum regularization scheme introduced by Barack and Ori, in which the field is decomposed into a sum over modes, and the singular part is removed from each mode using so-called regularization parameters. I find that the electrostatic self-force in Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter behaves similarly to Schwarzschild self-force near the black hole, but can deviate strongly at larger distances. This is especially true in Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter, where the self-force is seen to increase linearly with distance. I provide an explanation for this behaviour using conformal transformations. A particular feature evident in Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter is that the self-force can become negative (attractive) at small distances when the Schwarzschild radius and the cosmological length scale are of a similar order. I find that the scalar self-force in Schwarzschild-de Sitter can not actually be computed, and in Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter the asymptotic behaviour is similar to its electrostatic counterpart.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nuclear Structure Investigation of 110Cd through Beta-Decay of 110In</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Diaz Varela, Alejandra</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A study of the 110In beta+/EC decay was performed at the TRIUMF Isotope Separator and Accelerator (ISAC) facility to probe the nuclear structure of 110Cd. The data were collected in scaled-down gamma-ray singles, gamma-gamma coincidence, and $\gamma$-electron coincidence modes. The level scheme of 110Cd was expanded significantly by identifying 75 levels under 3.8 MeV, including 12 new ones, and the number of previously observed transitions from these levels was nearly doubled to 273. The gamma-ray branching intensities were extracted through an analysis of the coincidence intensities. The branching ratios were combined with a reanalysis of lifetimes measurements obtained in an (n,n'gamma) reaction with monoenergetic neutrons for the calculation of B(E2) values and these results have lead to the proposal of a gamma-soft rotor, or O(6) nucleus, rather than a vibrational, or U(5) pattern for the nature of the low-lying, low-spin levels in 110Cd.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Pulse shape discrimination studies in liquid argon for the DEAP-1 detector</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lidgard, Jeffrey Jack</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A detector with a target mass of 7 kg of liquid argon was designed, constructed and operated at Queen’s University. This detector is a scaled model for the DEAP project toward a tonne-scale argon detector to search for the WIMP candidate of the so far undetected, dark matter of the universe. The primary intent of the scaled detector was to measure the achievable level to reject background events by use of pulse shape discrimination, being based upon the scintillation timing properties of liquid argon. After refining the apparatus and components, the detector was in operation from the 20th of August until the 16th of October 2007 before being moved to its current location in SNOLAB. During this time, a population of 31 million well-tagged gamma events were collected, of which 15.8 million were in the energy range of interest for calibration. This population was sufficient to demonstrate the discrimination of background events by pulse shape discrimination at the level of 6.3 × 10-8. An analytical model was constructed, based on the scintillation processes and detector response, and has been sufficiently investigated to make predictions of further achievable discrimination. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2008-04-25 01:39:39.121</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Conformal Radiation Therapy with Cobalt-60 Tomotherapy</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Dhanesar, Sandeep Kaur</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced mode of high- precision radiation therapy that utilizes computer-controlled x-ray accelerators to deliver precise radiation doses to malignant tumors. The radiation dose is designed to conform to the three-dimensional (3-D) shape of a tumor by modulating the intensity of the radiation beam to focus a higher radiation dose to the tumor while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding normal tissue. One form of IMRT is known as tomotherapy. Tomotherapy achieves dose conformity to a tumor by modulating the intensity of a fan beam of radiation as the source revolves about a patient. Current available tomotherapy machines use x-ray linear accelerators (linacs) as a source of radiation. However, since linacs are technologically complex, the world- wide use of linac-based tomotherapy is limited. This thesis involves an investigation of Cobalt 60 (Co-60) based tomotherapy. The inherent simplicity of Co-60 has the potential to extend the availability of this technique to clinics throughout the world. The goal of this thesis is to generate two-dimensional (2-D) Co-60 tomotherapy con- formal dose distributions with a computer program and experimentally validate them on ¯lm using a ¯rst generation bench-top tomotherapy apparatus. The bench-top apparatus consists of a rotation-translation stage that can mimic a 2-D tomotherapy delivery by translating the phantom across a thin, "pencil- like" photon beam from various beam orientations. In this thesis, several random and clinical patterns are planned using an in-house inverse treatment planning system and are delivered on ¯lm using the tomotherapy technique. The delivered dose plans are compared with the simulated plans using the gamma dose comparison method. The results show a reasonably good agreement between the plans and the measurements, suggesting that Co-60 tomotherapy is indeed capable of providing state-of-the-art conformal dose delivery. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2008-04-25 02:20:56.102 ; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the ORDCF’s Ontario Consortium for Image-guided Therapy and Surgery.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Development of the SNO+ Experiment: Scintillator Timing, Pulse Shape Discrimination, and Sterile Neutrinos</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>O'Sullivan, ERIN</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The SNO+ experiment is a multi-purpose neutrino detector which is under construction in the SNOLAB facility in Sudbury, Ontario. SNO+ will search for neutrinoless double beta decay, and will measure low energy solar neutrinos. This thesis will describe three main development activities for the SNO+ experiment: the measurement of the timing parameters for the liquid scintillator cocktail, using those timing parameters to estimate the ability of SNO+ to discriminate alpha and beta events in the detector, and a sensitivity study that examines how solar neutrino data can constrain a light sterile neutrino model. Characterizing the timing parameters of the emission light due to charged-particle excitation in the scintillator is necessary for proper reconstruction of events in the detector. Using data obtained from a bench-top setup, the timing profile was modelled as three exponential components with distinct timing coefficients. Also investigated was the feasibility of using the timing profiles as a means to separate alpha and beta excitation events in the scintillator. The bench-top study suggested that using the peak-to-total method of analyzing the timing profiles could remove &gt;$99.9% of alpha events while retaining &gt;$99.9% of beta events. The timing parameters measured in the test set-up were then implemented in a Monte Carlo code which simulated the SNO+ detector conditions. The simulation results suggested that detector effects reduce the effectiveness of discriminating between alpha and beta events using the peak-to-total method. Using a more optimal method of analyzing the timing profile differences, specifically using a Gatti filter, improved the discrimination capability back to the levels determined in the bench-top setup. One of the physics goals of SNO+ is the first precision measurement of the pep solar neutrino flux at the level of about 5% uncertainty. A study was performed to investigate how current solar neutrino data constrains the allowed parameters of a light 3+1 sterile neutrino model. The impact of adding a SNO+ pep solar neutrino measurement on the allowed parameters of the sterile model was then examined. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2014-04-28 20:52:42.41</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Polarimeter for an Accelerated Spheromak</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Carle, PATRICK</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A three-beam heterodyne polarimeter has been designed and constructed to measure line-integrated density and Faraday rotation of accelerated spheromak plasmas in the Plasma Injector 1 and 2 devices (PI-1, PI-2) at General Fusion Inc. Faraday rotation is a function of the local magnetic field and electron density. Therefore, the polarimeter has the potential to provide information on the internal magnetic field of the plasma. A typical spheromak is about 1m in length and is accelerated to speeds on the order of 100km/s. At a bandwidth of 1MHz, the polarimeter can axially resolve the spheromak down to about 10cm. The polarimeter uses a $\nit{CO}_2$ laser that produces a Faraday rotation signal of about $0.5\degrees$ for a typical plasma with density and magnetic field on the order of $\ee{21}\mmt$ and 1T. The Faraday rotation measurement noise floor for a null signal is about $0.1\degrees$. Two important sources of Faraday rotation error are the ellipticity and collinearity of the plasma-immersed beams. These error sources are examined by sending the plasma beams through a rotating optic to mimic the path through a dense, magnetized plasma. The error due to the ellipticity effect has been reduced to below the noise floor by careful alignment and use of zero phase reflectors that minimize elliptical polarization of the beams. Collinearity error has been greatly improved by aligning the beams with a rotating ZnSe wedge. Measurements after the alignment match well with a model Faraday rotation signal generated from magnetic probe measurements. However, beam collinearity continues to be a significant source of error. For regions with strong density gradients, the size of this error can be on the order of the signal magnitude. For future work, steps should be taken to improve the alignment of the two plasma-immersed beams, and to shorten the length of the beam path to further reduce the beam collinearity error. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2014-04-30 22:17:18.648</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Automatic P-wave Picking of Microseismic Events in Underground Mines</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Johnson, Stephanie</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis investigates microseismic P-wave arrival time detection performance of automatic picking algorithms, as well as the handpicking performance of human experts. The data set used in this project was collected from Malmberget mine (LKAB, Sweden) and the handpicked P-wave arrivals were prepared by multiple expert analysts from the Institute of Mine Seismology (IMS). Characterization of the event records in the data set was completed including the magnitude distribution of the events, noise content of the traces, and frequency spectrum of the traces. Three promising automatic P-wave picking algorithms from previous seismological research were investigated: the short-term average to long-term average ratio detector (STA/LTA), the characteristic function detector (CF), and the autoregressive modelling detector (ARfpe). Several versions of each algorithm were implemented, and the most promising versions were tested on the full dataset of microseismic events. The STA/LTA algorithm and CF algorithm were superior to the ARfpe algorithm in terms of accuracy and percentage of false negatives (missed P-wave arrival time picks). The analyst P-wave arrival times were compared and statistical distributions of the analyst P-wave arrival time differences were studied. The analyst P-wave arrival time difference and algorithm P-wave arrival time difference were defined as the mean analyst P-wave arrival time minus the specific analyst P-wave arrival time pick or the specific algorithm P-wave arrival time pick. The analyst and algorithm P-wave arrival time differences were combined into separate statistical distributions and compared. The analyst P-wave arrival time distribution lengths varied by a factor of 5, and the percentage of outliers in the distribution varied between 12% and 32%. The STA/LTA algorithm had comparable distribution statistics to the worst analyst P-wave arrival in terms of median value, distribution length, and percentage of outliers. However when the number of traces with automatic P-wave picks within the analyst handpicking range was calculated the STA/LTA algorithm had only 32.0% of picks and the CF algorithm had only 11.6% of picks. ; Thesis (Master, Mining Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2014-04-30 21:45:13.741</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Terahertz driven intraband dynamics of excitons in nanorods</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sy, Fredrik</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Quantum dots and nanorods are becoming increasingly important structures due to their potential applications that range from photovoltaic devices to medicine. The majority of the research on carrier dynamics in these structures has been in the optical regime, with little work performed at Terahertz frequencies where excitonic dynamics can be more directly probed. In this work, we examine theoretically the interaction of Terahertz radiation with colloidal CdSe nanorods to determine the dynamics of excitons generated via a short optical pulse. We calculate the energies and wavefunctions for the excitons within the envelope function approximation in the low density limit where there is at most one exciton per nanorod. The linear Terahertz transmittance and absorbance is found for nanorods that are approximately 70 nm in length and 7 nm in diameter and are compared with experimental results that have shown the first observation of intra-excitonic transitions in nanorods. We find absorbance peaks at 8.5 THz and 11 THz that result from polarizations in the longitudinal (rod axis) and transverse directions respectively. Our theoretical results show that the 8.5 THz and 11 Thz peaks are due to 1s-2pz and 1s-2px transitions respectively. The theoretical absorbance spectra is in good agreement with the experimental one and show that only the ground state is significantly populated 1 ps after optical excitation. This provides strong evidence of rapid trapping of excited holes into the ligand used to passivate the nanorods. A full set of dynamical equations were then constructed from Heisenberg's equation of motion, and were used to model the excitonic correlations as a function of time. Transmittance and absorbance were calculated for different nanorod orientations and electric field strengths in both the linear and nonlinear regime. These results were then averaged over nanorod orientation in order to more accurately reflect experimental conditions. Nonlinearity was found to become significant at peak pulse field strengths of 7 kV/cm and greater. Due to two-photon processes, we predict the 2pz-3dz transition that is not observed in the linear regime will be clearly seen in the nonlinear absorbance spectrum. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2014-05-14 23:37:58.604</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Evaluation of Swirl and Tabs in Short Annular Diffusers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cerantola, David</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Short annular diffusers were essential components for turbomachines that have been used to expand the air entering the compressor, as interstage ducts between gas generators and power turbines, and on the exhaust gases exiting the turbine. The industrial community was interested and invested in improving diffuser design that was challenging owing to the unfavourable fluid flow effects. Efficient design of fluid flow devices was possible through the complementary use of experimental testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A numerical shape optimization study was undertaken to determine preferential annular diffuser configurations. Experimental data were compared against CFD that simulated the steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with two-equation turbulence models. This investigation reached equivalent conclusions with respect to the influences associated with diffuser geometry and swirl. Vorticity effects caused by square tabs, that were not as well understood, were investigated. The tabs were effective in reducing the central toroidal recirculation zone created by a swirling flow, but at a static pressure penalty for the area ratio, AR&lt;2.73, diffusers tested. Results identified several shortcomings in the CFD that typically over-estimated pressure recovery and outlet velocity uniformity; however, properly qualitatively predicted wall pressure distributions and outlet velocity profiles. The use of CFD on modest grids, with preference given to the realizable k-epsilon turbulence model, for annular diffusers that have length to inlet height ratio of 12 and at least AR=2.73 with up to 20-degrees inlet swirl was encouraged as a design tool. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2014-05-29 09:03:16.591</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Calibration Hardware Research and Development for SNO+</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Walker, Matthew</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The SNO+ experiment is a kilo-tonne scale liquid scintillator detector located at SNOLAB in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. As the successor to the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, SNO+ will use linear alkylbenzene (LAB) as the scintillator to study neutrinos. During the solar phase, ux measurements will be made of low energy neutrinos originating in the Sun. In another phase, 800 kg of tellurium will loaded into the scintillator to search for neutrinoless double beta decay. Measurements will also be made of neutrinos coming from nearby nuclear reactors and from inside Earth's mantle and crust. To enable these multiple physics goals, a sensitive calibration procedure must be carried out in order to fully understand the detector. The optical and energy responses of the detector will be measured with calibration sources deployed throughout the acrylic vessel. These sources must be connected to the observatory deck above the vessel by gas capillaries, optical bres, and signal wires housed in specially designed submersible umbilical cables. The design and fabrication of these umbilical cables is presented. Development work on a deployed radon calibration source will also be described. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2014-05-30 15:56:19.906</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Early development of a test-bed to measure fractoluminescence in scintillators &amp; simulation of a Na-24 source for the SNO+ experiment</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mony, Emilie</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis consists of two parts; the first part pertains to fractoluminescence as a potential background in crystal scintillator detectors, and the second part bears on the simulation of a 24Na source to be used during the liquid scintillator phase of the SNO+ experiment. I participated in early work to develop a test-bed to study fractoluminescence in scintillators, and report here on preliminary results I obtained before I shifted my focus to SNO+. Full results obtained by the group have since been reported in PRL 111 154301 [1]. This project follows the discovery that mechanical stress on a dark matter detector’s crystals was causing a background signal. The response of inorganic crystal scintillators (Bi4Ge3O12, ZnWO4 , CdWO4 ) compressed to the point of rupture was studied. The double cleavage drilled compression geometry was used to create controlled cracks in 20×5×3 mm3 samples. A correlation between a sudden drop of the force, a burst of photonic and of acoustic emissions was discovered and a lower bound was set on the conversion efficiency from strain energy to light energy. SNO+ is a large underground experiment that aims primarily to search for neutrinoless double beta decay. The SNO+ detector consists of an acrylic vessel of liquid scintillator surrounded by light detectors. A tagged 24Na source was proposed as one of several radioactive sources to be deployed within the vessel to calibrate the detector. To achieve this an activated NaI(Tl) crystal would be coupled to a photomultiplier tube and lowered into the center of the vessel. The second half of this thesis explores options for implementing this plan and presents the detector response to a 24Na source as simulated by the Monte Carlo software developed by SNO+. The size of the crystal influences the type of information that can be gleaned from using this source so four different crystal sizes are presented for comparison. The simulations show that the source can be used to test the linearity of the energy scale and the simulation’s quenching model. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2014-06-18 17:46:15.685</dc:description>

          <dc:title>In-line optical fiber interferometric refractive index sensors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tian, Zhaobing</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>With many unique advantages compared to traditional sensors, optical fiber sensors have been studied and applied to many different areas. Interferometric sensors are one of the most useful sensor types due to their high sensitivities and relatively relaxed requirement on the stability of the optical source’s power level. In-line optical interferometric sensors received further attention as a result of compactness and robustness to the reference channel instability. Long period gratings (LPG) are one of the most useful components in the in-line optical fiber sensors. However, the fabrication cost is normally high due to the expensive masks and stringent photolithographic procedures. Two new sensor components, namely abrupt tapers and connector-offset attenuators, are proposed as couplers in the optical fiber to couple light from core to cladding (or reverse) to replace LPGs. Using OPTIBPM software, the coupling coefficients between core and cladding modes are calculated. For an abrupt taper, coupling mostly happens between LP01 and LP0m modes; the first ten LP0m modes account for 98% of the incident mode energy. For a connector-offset attenuator, coupling mainly happens between LP01 and LP1m modes; the first ten LP0m and first ten LP1m modes account for 92% of the incident mode energy. The relative direction of two connector-offset attenuators is found to be very important to the interference performance. Phase dependent interference (attenuation range from 1 dB to 35 dB) is observed in the simulation for the interferometers using abrupt tapers and connector-offset attenuators. Three interferometers are realized in the experiment using the abrupt tapers (Mach-Zehnder and Michelson) or the connector-offset attenuators (Michelson). Due to the interference between core and cladding modes, transmission is strongly dependent on wavelength ranging from 3 dB to 26 dB in the best implementation. Although it is difficult to make two perfect parallel connector-offset attenuators required by the Mach-Zehnder interferometers by using the fusion splicer, some evidence of constructive interference is observed in the experiment. The interferometers are tested as refractive index (RI) sensors using the maximum attenuation wavelength shift relative to the RI change. Given that the minimum resolution of optical spectrum analyzer is 10 pm, ~10-4 difference of the RI can be detected by the interferometric sensors using the abrupt tapers or the connector-offset attenuators. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-18 15:42:59.506</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The effects of porous media on explosion development in partially filled enclosures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hlouschko, Stefan Joseph</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Two experiments were performed to investigate the interaction of a combustion wave with porous media. The first experiment was performed in a 1.22m long, 76mm wide, and 152mm high horizontal channel with a nitrogen-diluted stoichiometric methane-oxygen mixture at initial pressures of 20-50kPa. A layer of 12.7mm diameter ceramic-oxide spheres was placed along the bottom to partially obstruct the channel, leaving a gap of free space above. For a fixed gap height the bead layer thickness had very little effect on explosion propagation. For a fixed bead layer thickness the explosion propagation was strongly influenced by the gap height. For example, a 31% nitrogen diluted mixture at room temperature resulted in DDT for a gap height of 38mm at initial pressures of 30-50 kPa, but not for 109mm over the same pressures. The gap above the bead layer permits DDT as long as the gap height is larger than one detonation cell width. Propagation of the detonation wave over the bead layer is possible if the gap height can accommodate at least two detonation cells. For a 38mm gap, velocity measurements and sooted foil imprints indicate that the detonation undergoes successive failure and re-initiation, referred to as “galloping” in the literature. In the second experiment, the head-on collision of a combustion front with a layer of 3 and 12.7mm diameter ceramic-oxide spheres was investigated in a 61cm long, 76.2mm diameter vertical tube for a nitrogen-diluted stoichiometric ethylene-oxygen mixture at initial pressures of 10-100kPa. Four orifice plates were placed at the ignition end to accelerate the premixed flame to a “fast-flame” or a detonation wave. For fast-flames pressures recorded at the bead layer face were up to five times the reflected CJ detonation pressure. This explosion iv developed by two distinct mechanisms: a) shock reflection off the bead layer face and b) shock transmission into the bead layer and subsequent explosion therein. The measured explosion delay time (time after shock reflection from the bead layer face) was found to be independent of the incident shock velocity. Thus, it was shown that explosion initiation is not the direct result of shock reflection but is more likely due to the interaction of the reflected shock with the trailing flame. The bead layer was found to be very effective in attenuating the explosion and isolating the tube endplate. ; Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-15 17:57:22.213</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Ultrafast Dynamics of Individual Air-Suspended Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Nhan, TAM</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Thorough understanding of the electronic and optical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) will no doubt benefit future technological applications. Since the discovery of band gap photoluminescence from isolated semiconducting SWCNTs, significant progresses in studying the optical properties of SWCNTs have been made (e.g. linear polarization along the tube axis for the absorption and emission of light, excitonic nature in SWCNT excitation). However, there are still several controversial parameters of SWCNTs (e.g. quantum efficiency, absorption cross section, radiative lifetime, and Auger recombination lifetime). With the advancement in SWCNT sample preparation, studies of SWCNT intrinsic properties have shifted from ensemble to a single tube level, in which the ambiguities in elucidating intrinsic properties posed by the assortment of different tube species can be minimized. By examining individual SWCNTs suspended in air, in contrast to micelle-encapsulated SWCNTs, we believe that the environmental effects can be reduced. This thesis will demonstrate the capability of doing spectroscopy on a single semiconducting air-suspended SWCNT. In continuous-wave excitation, the photoluminescence excitation map and high resolution photoluminescence (PL) image of a SWCNT can be constructed, and PL polarization is proven. Quantum efficiency of 5% is experimentally estimated for (9,8) and (10,8) chiral SWCNTs. Pulse excitation allows us to study the intrinsic exciton dynamics of a SWCNT. To gain insight into exciton nonlinear decay processes, PL saturation in pump power dependence measurement is investigated and compared to the simulated results from stochastic models of exciton dynamics. Femtosecond excitation correlation spectroscopy with 150 fs time resolution is employed to time-resolve the PL of a single tube suspended in air. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-29 13:10:49.045</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Investigations into the Optical Properties of Individual, Air-Suspended, Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wilson, Mark</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Single-walled carbon nanotubes are naturally-forming nanostructures that have attracted considerable recent research interest due to their unique opto-electronic properties and comparative ease of fabrication. Two-thirds of nanotube species are semiconductors due to symmetry conditions imposed by their pseudo-one-dimensional tubular structure, and exhibit band-gap photoluminescence when isolated from their environment. Despite their elegant structural simplicity, fundamental properties of carbon nanotubes, such as their intrinsic quantum efficiency, non-linear excitonic recombination mechanisms, and the role of environmental effects, continue to be disputed in the literature. The design of an apparatus capable of observing nanotube photoluminescence is presented, along with conclusive proof of the observation of a single (9,8)-chirality nanotube in the form of spectral, spatial, and polarization-dependent measurements. The dependance of the excitation and emission spectra of a single nanotube on the excitation intensity is explored and the emission spectra found to be described by a Gaussian peak function, in contrast to previously-reported results. The unexpected ability to cause redshifts in the emission spectrum via the ambient humidity is discovered, which has consequences on experimental best practices. Photoluminescence quantum efficiencies are measured to be 4±2% and 13±6% for two different nanotubes. This is at the high end of the range for comparable literature results, and supports the validity of a recent literature value for the effective atomic absorption coefficient for carbon, AC=1.6×10^−3nm^2, which is ten times greater than previous literature values. Pulsed power dependence studies show that the PL emission undergoes ‘hard’ saturation at an excitation intensity of 0.5×10^12photons/pulse/cm2, which is at least 100 times lower than previous reports and provides insight into non-linear decay dynamics. A novel theoretical model is developed to explain this saturation process, which yields an absorption co-efficient of AC=1.2±0.3×10^−3nm^2 as a fit parameter. Time-resolved photoluminescence dynamics are explored using femtosecond excitation correlation spectroscopy. Results suggest that the one-body decay processes are bi-exponential, with time constants of 31±4ps and 313±61ps, but also highlight the limitations of this technique in observing the expected very rapid (~1 ps) two-body Auger recombination process. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-26 16:23:40.81</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The optical properties of metamaterial waveguide structures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Reza, ARVIN</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Metamaterials, artificially engineered structures with negative average relative permittivity and permeability, provide a route to creating potential devices with exciting electromagnetic properties that cannot be obtained with natural materials. One particularly interesting metamaterial device, is a planar metamaterial waveguide structure (MWS) that has potentially exciting applications. In this thesis, the properties and potential applications of metamaterial waveguide structures are explored. In particular, we examine the properties of metamaterial waveguides when the limitations arise from fabrication techniques and physical principles are taken into account. First, we study the basic properties of dispersion curves of an idealized (without loss and dispersion) metamaterial waveguide structure. We show that there are a rich variety of modes, such as the bound modes, the surface polariton modes, and the complex leaky modes, that are supported in MWS and have entirely different properties than the modes of a conventional waveguide structure. These novel modes provide more control over the electromagnetic fields and consequently lead to potential applications ranging from waveguide miniaturization to the slowing down of the light. Next, we study the effects of dispersion and loss, which are the inherent features of metamaterials, on the properties of MWS. We numerically show that the characteristic modes of the MWS are significantly changed particularly near the slow-light-modes when the intrinsic loss is introduced into the system. In particular we show that the stopped-light-modes disappear even in the presence of an arbitrarily small amount of loss. Moreover, we find several novel properties such as a splitting of complex leaky modes in a lossy MWS. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2008-10-31 14:47:47.054</dc:description>

          <dc:title>AN EXCITONIC APPROACH TO THE ULTRAFAST OPTICAL RESPONSE OF SEMICONDUCTOR NANO-STRUCTURES</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wang, Dawei</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, I present an excitonic approach to treating the coherent dynamics of optically generated charge carriers in semiconductor nanostructures. The main feature of this approach is that it includes exchange interactions and phase space filling effects, which have generally been omitted in previous excitonic treatments of coherent dynamics, so that it can go beyond the low excitation limit. In contrast to the well-known semiconductor Bloch equations, this approach treats intraband correlations without factorization. The excitonic formalism and the obtained excitonic equations are shown to be particularly advantageous in systems where bound excitons dominate the optical response and where intraband correlations play a central role. To demonstrate the application of the excitonic approach, we simulate the coherent carrier dynamics of an optically-excited, updoped AlGaAs superlattice in the presence of a terahertz pulse, where 1s excitonic states as well as higher in-plane excited states are included. We find that gain coefficients greater than 20/cm can be achieved over a tuning range of 3-11THz and that due to the coherent cascading of the carriers down the excitonic Wannier-Stark ladder, the gain coefficients have much higher gain saturation fields than comparable two-level systems. To investigate the effects of phase space filling and exchange interaction on exciton dynamics, we then apply the excitonic formalism to a simple model of a quantum ring as well as a realistic model of a quantum well. For the quantum ring, we have obtained numerical results regarding exciton population and interband polarization. We also compared our excitonic approach to the semiconductor Bloch equations in detail using this simple model. For the quantum well, in addition to the investigation of exciton dynamics, we propose and examine several approximations that can make our excitonic dynamic equations very efficient. The excitonic formalism presented in this thesis is an efficient approach that can be applied in a wide range of systems, which makes it a potential alternative to the standard miconductor Bloch equations for many systems where the intraband correlations are crucial. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2008-12-01 18:21:17.181</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Intrinsic exciton dynamics from single air-suspended semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>XIAO, YEE-FANG</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (S-SWCNTs) have direct band gaps with a range of 0.5 to 2 eV depending on the SWCNT chirality. The photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency and the carriers’ radiative lifetime have been previously studied but neither of them have been confirmed due to the large variation resulting from ensemble averaging, environmental effects, SWCNT defects, and SWCNT bundles. For example, quantum efficiency was estimated to be 0.01% to 7% and radiative lifetime was estimated or calculated to be 10 to 100 ns. In this thesis, we study absorption cross section, PL quantum efficiency and exciton relaxation dynamics from single air-suspended S-SWCNTs and extract “intrinsic” S-SWCNT properties. The photo-excited carriers are electron-hole pairs (called excitons) in a SWCNT due to the strong Coulomb interactions in the nm-scale system. We selected relatively bright and less defected S-SWCNTs on our samples for investigation. For each SSWCNT, the tube length, orientation, absorption and emission spectra were recorded. Experimentally, we observed that PL from a single S-SWCNT increases linearly at low excitation intensity (linear regime) and saturates at higher intensity (saturation regime). We also studied the exciton relaxation dynamics on each S-SWCNT by femtosecond excitation correlation (FEC) spectroscopy and resolved two relaxation time constants which were independent of the excitation intensity. We compare the simulation results based on a stochastic model to the experimental data and extract essential parameters including S-SWCNT unitless absorption coefficient (typically 0.02 to 0.06), PL quantum efficiency (typically 7 to 20 %) and exciton relaxation time constants. We observed very fast nonlinear exciton-exciton annihilation rate (&gt;(2 ps)^−1) in a typical 5 μm-long S-SWCNTs. The exciton dynamics were consistent from 4 different S-SWCNTs in the saturation regime and the average total exciton number per pulse per tube in this saturation regime ranges from 2 to 12. Compared to past work, the results (PL saturation curves and FEC data) between S-SWCNTs are very consistent which supports our belief that we are studying “intrinsic properties”. We found a higher absorption coefficient, and higher PL quantum efficiency of S-SWCNTs compared to previous work. We also observe very fast nonlinear exciton-exciton annihilation in a relatively longer S-SWCNT and at lower exciton numbers. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-01-08 20:38:56.433</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Characterization of Pulse–Shape Discrimination for Background Reduction in the DEAP-1 Detector</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pasuthip, PARADORN</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>DEAP (Dark Matter Experiment with Argon and Pulse Shape Discrimination) is an experiment that aims to directly detect dark matter particles via nuclear recoils in liquid argon. The experiment uses the scintillation property of liquid argon as a means to discriminate the γ and β backgrounds from the expected signal. DEAP-1 is a 7 kg single phase liquid argon detector. It was constructed to demonstrate the scalability for a larger (3600 kg) detector. The detector was originally operated at Queen’s University, where the background rejection level achieved was 6.3×10−8 for the recoil detection efficiency of 97.1%. The detector was relocated to SNOLAB, where the background in the energy region of interest was reduced by a factor of 7.7 (from 4.61±0.17 mHz to 0.60±0.05 mHz.). The background rejection level of 9.64×10−9 (10.4 part per billion) was achieved from the combined data set (Queen’s University and SNOLAB) for a recoil detection efficiency of 35.5 ± 1.3 %. With the current background rate, the background rejection level required for the 3600 kg detector (1.8×10−9 ) is projected to be achieved in 382 days at the neutron efficiency of 9.1±0.6 %. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-01-26 09:28:25.432</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Simulation of Engineered Nanostructured Thin Films</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cheung, JASON</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The invention of the Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD) technique a decade ago enabled the fabrication of nanostructured thin films with highly tailorable structural, electrical, optical, and magnetic properties. Here a three-dimensional atomic-scale growth simulator has been developed to model the growth of thin film materials fabricated with the GLAD technique, utilizing the Monte Carlo (MC) and Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) methods; the simulator is capable of predicting film structure under a wide range of deposition conditions with a high degree of accuracy as compared to experiment. The stochastic evaporation and transport of atoms from the vapor source to the substrate is modeled as random ballistic deposition, incorporating the dynamic variation in substrate orientation that is central to the GLAD technique, and surface adatom diffusion is modeled as either an activated random walk (MC), or as energy dependent complete system transitions with rates calculated based on site-specific bond counting (KMC). The Sculptured Nanostructured Film Simulator (SNS) provides a three-dimensional physical prediction of film structure given a set of deposition conditions, enabling the calculation of film properties including porosity, roughness, and fractal dimension. Simulations were performed under various growth conditions in order to gain an understanding of the effects of incident angle, substrate rotation, tilt angle, and temperature on the resulting morphology of the thin film. Analysis of the evolution of film porosity during growth suggests a complex growth dynamic with significant variations with changes in tilt or substrate motion, in good agreement with x-ray reflectivity measurements. Future development will merge the physical structure growth simulator, SNS, with Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) electromagnetics simulation to allow predictive design of nanostructured optical materials. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-03-31 13:22:11.843</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The White Beam Steady-State Diffractometer: A Next Generation Neutron Diffraction Strain Scanner</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Percival, Aaron</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This project proposes a reactor-based instrument, which retains most of the above advantages of spallation source engineering instruments, while maintaining the advantages inherent to steady-state instruments. The main idea is to allow the entire white beam from the reactor onto the sample---no monochromation. Diffraction is then allowed at a fixed angle, and information from two sample directions can be obtained simultaneously. Since a white beam is incident onto the sample, the diffraction condition is satisfied for multiple sample planes in the fixed angle of diffraction. Multiple analyzer/detector pairs are placed downstream from the sample and tuned to scatter only one of the diffracted wavelength bands. Monte Carlo methods were used to create models of both a standard two-axis engineering diffractometer, found on current reactor sources, and the proposed white beam instrument. There models were validated by experiments performed on a standard two-axis instrument, which was also modified to operate in a white beam configuration, in which the position of the sample and monochromator were interchanged. Both the models and the experiments of the white beam instrument showed proof of concept for this design and identified areas of concern that required special attention. Upon a comparison on the results from the standard two-axis instrument to the results from the white beam instrument (both simulation and experimental), it was found that the standard diffractometer showed a better performance in all aspects. However, this project proposes numerous areas where the white beam design can be improved upon in order to enhance its performance as an engineering instrument. The most important of these is the design of an appropriate analyzer/detector system, as the results overwhelmingly show this to be the area of greatest concern. Ideas for a few such designs are also given. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-04-23 17:46:59.419</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical Studies of the Combined Effects of Interactions and Disorder at Metal-Insulator Transitions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>CHEN, XI</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We first study noninteracting electrons moving on corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices, which represent the conduction path of LiAlyTi2−yO4. A uniform box distribution type of disorder for the on-site energies is assumed. Using the Dyson-Mehta Delta-3 statistics as a criterion for localization, we have determined the critical disorder (Wc/t = 14.5 ± 0.25) and the mobility-edge trajectories. Then we study the Anderson-Hubbard model, which includes both interactions and disorder, using a real-space self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory. We provide a partial assessment on how the Hartree-Fock theory approximates the ground states of the Anderson-Hubbard model, using small clusters which can be solved exactly. The Hartree-Fock theory works very well in reproducing the ground-state energies and local charge densities. However, it does not work as well in representing the spin-spin correlations. To find the ground state, one needs to allow maximum degree of freedom in spins. Evidence of screening of disorder by the interactions is provided. We have applied the Hartree-Fock theory to large-scale three-dimensional simple cubic lattices. For a disorder strength of W/t = 6, weak interactions (U/t ≤ 3) enhance the density of states at the Fermi level and the low-frequency conductivity. There are no local magnetic moments, and the AC conductivity is Drude-like. With stronger interactions (U/t ≥ 4), the density of states at the Fermi level and the low-frequency conductivity are both suppressed. These are accompanied by the presence of local magnetic moments, and the conductivity becomes non-Drude-like. A metal-to-insulator transition is likely to take place at a critical Uc/t ≈ 8 – 9. We find that (i) the formation of magnetic moments is essential to the suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level, and therefore essential to the metal-insulator transition; (ii) the form of magnetic moments does not matter; and (iii) these results do not depend on the type of lattice or the type of disorder. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-05-26 02:20:04.652</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Two-Dimensional Horizontal Wave Propagation and Mud Mass Transport Model on Muddy Coastal Regions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>OVEISY, ALI</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>It is well known that surface water waves interact with fluid mud on the sea bed. Wave mud interaction results in high wave energy dissipation and mud mass transport. This kind of wave energy dissipation, which generally is much more significant than wave dissipation due to bottom friction, should be considered in the simulation of wave evolution and transformation in muddy coastal environments. In this research, a two-dimensional horizontal wave propagation and morphodynamic model for muddy coasts was developed. The model can be applied on a general three dimensional bathymetry of a soft muddy coast to calculate wave damping, fluid mud transport and resulting bathymetry change under wave action. In addition to the effect of wave-mud interaction on wave propagation, the dissipation due to wave-mud interaction was also implemented in SWAN (a third generation numerical model for Simulating WAves Nearshore) using a multilayered wave mud interaction model. These two models combined can be used for generation and propagation of waves in muddy coastal areas. The nonlinear constitutive equations of the visco-elastic-plastic model are adopted for the rheological behavior of fluid mud in this research. The results of the numerical model are compared against a series of wave-basin experiments, wave flume experiments and field observations. Comparisons between the simulated results with the both field and laboratory data reveal the capability of the proposed model to predict the wave transformation and mud mass transport. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-07-24 11:18:18.622</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Ringdown spectroscopy in optical waveguides</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Trefiak, Nicholas Ronald</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Ringdown spectroscopy (RDS) is an absorption spectroscopic and detection technique that makes use of an optical cavity to realize a long effective pathlength through a sample and to render the measurement independent of intensity. These two features give RDS an advantage over traditional absorption techniques and allows its application in measuring concentrations of strongly absorbing analytes present in trace amounts, or in measuring weak absorptions for analytes in higher concentrations. The resonant optical cavities used here are created from optical fibre. This permits the easy construction of an inexpensive apparatus for RDS. The performance of various cavity geometries (linear, circular) in three ranges of the visible and near infrared spectrum (405, 800, and 1550 nm) was examined. Concurrent multiexponential decays arising from core modes, cladding modes, and amplified spontaneous emission were analyzed in the framework of an exponential decay model transformed into the frequency domain. The small mode field diameter of light within a fibre is well suited to probing very small liquid volumes on the order of pico- or femtolitres. This uniquely positions optical waveguide-based RDS for application in absorption detection for separation techniques such as capillary electrophoresis (CE) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) where high time resolution detection is required across narrow separation channels. The experimental and theoretical work presented here was preformed with an eye towards this purpose. ; Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2007-07-04 16:23:53.173</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Geodesic reduction via frame bundle geometry</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bhand, Ajit</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Reduction theory for systems with symmetry deals with the problem of understanding dynamics on a manifold with an action of a Lie group. In geometric mechanics, this problem can be formulated in the Lagrangian, Hamiltonian or affine connection frameworks. While the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations have been well developed, the results obtained in these setups are based on variational principles and symplectic geometry. These methods cannot be used directly in the affine connection formulation unless additional structure is available. In this thesis, a manifold with an arbitrary affine connection is considered, and the geodesic spray associated with the connection is studied in the presence of a Lie group action. In particular, results are obtained that provide insight into the structure of the reduced dynamics associated with the given invariant affine connection. The geometry of the frame bundle of the given manifold is used to provide an intrinsic description of the geodesic spray. A fundamental relationship between the geodesic spray, the tangent lift and the vertical lift of the symmetric product is obtained, which provides a key to understanding reduction in this formulation. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2007-07-24 01:00:05.635</dc:description>

          <dc:title>All-optical 3R regeneration for agile all-photonic networks</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ito, Christopher Joshua Shiro</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Transmission impairments degrade the quality of optical signals, ultimately limiting the achievable transmission distance. Optical 3R regenerators provide an effective means of coping with transmission impairments by restoring the quality of optical signals through reamplification, reshaping, and retiming (3Rs), thereby enabling reliable transmission over long distances. Beyond the 3Rs, however, regenerators must also be able to operate within the practical constraints of the network. The specific network of interest in this thesis is referred to as an agile all-photonic network (AAPN). In AAPNs, traffic consists of optical packets that are routed through the core of the network without undergoing optical-to-electrical conversion for signal processing (e.g., 3R regeneration). As a result, 3R regeneration must be performed all-optically, otherwise known as all-optical 3R regeneration (AO-3R). Although a variety of AO-3R techniques have been demonstrated, none have been specifically designed to operate within the practical constraints of AAPNs. In this thesis, a 10 Gb/s all-optical 3R regeneration (AO-3R) technique is proposed, specifically designed to operate within the practical constraints of AAPNs. The technique performs AO-3R in a novel 2-stage design. In the first stage, all-optical retiming is achieved using a self-pulsating distributed feedback laser (SP-DFBL) for all-optical clock recovery and cross-phase modulation (XPM) in highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) with offset spectral slicing for the retiming. In the second stage, all-optical reshaping (and reamplification) is achieved using self-phase modulation (SPM) in HNLF with offset spectral slicing. Experimental assessment of the AO-3R system performance yields excellent results. In particular, AO-3R is shown to improve the performance of input signals degraded by transmission impairments, such as amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise, while providing low sensitivity to input signal properties, such as the state-of-polarization. Furthermore, AO-3R is shown to successfully achieve its ultimate goal for AAPNs – the regeneration of optical packets. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2007-08-09 16:31:25.462</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A GEOMETRIC APPROACH TO ENERGY SHAPING</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gharesifard, BAHMAN</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis is initiated a more systematic geometric exploration of energy shaping. Most of the previous results have been dealt wih particular cases and neither the existence nor the space of solutions has been discussed with any degree of generality. The geometric theory of partial differential equations originated by Goldschmidt and Spencer in late 1960s is utilized to analyze the partial differential equations in energy shaping. The energy shaping partial differential equations are described as a fibered submanifold of a $ k $-jet bundle of a fibered manifold. By revealing the nature of kinetic energy shaping, similarities are noticed between the problem of kinetic energy shaping and some well-known problems in Riemannian geometry. In particular, there is a strong similarity between kinetic energy shaping and the problem of finding a metric connection initiated by Eisenhart and Veblen. We notice that the necessary conditions for the set of so-called $ \lambda $-equation restricted to the control distribution are related to the Ricci identity, similarly to the Eisenhart and Veblen metric connection problem. Finally, the set of $ \lambda $-equations for kinetic energy shaping are coupled with the integrability results of potential energy shaping. The procedure shows how a poor design of closed-loop metric can make it impossible to achieve any flexibility in the character of the possible closed-loop potential function. The integrability results of this thesis have been used to answer some interesting questions about the energy shaping. In particular, a geometric proof is provided which shows that linear controllability is sufficient for energy shaping of linear simple mechanical systems. Furthermore, it is shown that all linearly controllable mechanical control systems with one degree of underactuation can be stabilized using energy shaping feedback. The result is geometric and completely characterizes the energy shaping problem for these systems. Using the geometric approach of this thesis, some new open problems in energy shaping are formulated. In particular, we give ideas for relating the kinetic energy shaping problem to a problem on holonomy groups. Moreover, we suggest that the so-called Fakras lemma might be used for investigating the stabilization condition of energy shaping. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-02 12:12:55.051</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Classical and Quantum Optical Properties of Slow Light Photonic Crystal Waveguides</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Patterson, Mark</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Photonic crystals are optical materials where patterning of dielectrics on sub-wavelength length scales creates unusual optical properties such as waveguides with propagation speeds much slower than the vacuum speed of light. In this thesis, I examine the classical and quantum optical properties of such structures, specifically the enhancement of photon emission rate from a single quantum dot embedded in the waveguide (the Purcell Effect) and extrinsic scattering from an injected waveguide mode due to fabrication imperfections. The photon emission rate is found to be significantly enhanced over a large bandwidth in slow light photonic crystal waveguides and I provide detailed results for optimizing the emission properties of a novel photonic crystal ridge waveguide to suite a given application. Using an incoherent scattering theory, I show how slow light propagation enhances extrinsic scattering from unavoidable manufacturing imperfections leading to back scattering and radiation loss that scale with the group velocity v_g, as v_g^{-2} and v_g^{-1} respectively. I then improve the modeling of scattering using a coherent, multiple scattering approach to explain the experimental observation of disordered resonances in slow light waveguide modes. The theoretical predictions show good agreement with experimental measurements. This document provides a thorough introduction to the properties and problems of slow light photonic crystal waveguides. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-03 12:29:01.696</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Robust Signal Extraction Methods and Monte Carlo Sensitivity Studies for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory and SNO+ Experiments</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>WRIGHT, ALEXANDER</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The third and final phase of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) experiment utilized a series of 3He proportional counters called Neutral Current Detectors (NCDs) to detect the neutrons produced by the neutral current interactions of solar neutrinos in the detector. The number of neutrons detected by the NCDs, and hence the total flux of 8B solar neutrinos, has been determined using two novel signal extraction techniques which were designed to be robust against potential unexpected behaviour in the NCD background. These techniques yield total 8B solar neutrino flux measurements of 5.04(+0.42-0.40(stat))(+/-0.28(syst))x10E6/cm2/s and (4.40 - 6.43)x10E6/cm2/s, which are in good agreement with previous SNO results and with solar model predictions, and which confirm that previous NCD analyses were not unduly affected by unexpected background behaviour. The majority of the hardware from the now-completed SNO experiment will be reused to create a new liquid scintillator based neutrino experiment called SNO+. An important part of the SNO+ physics program will be a search for neutrinoless double beta decay, carried out by dissolving 150Nd into the scintillator. The sensitivity of the SNO+ experiment to neutrinoless double beta decay has been evaluated. If loaded at 0.1% (w/w) with natural neodymium, after 1 kTa of data taking SNO+ would have a 90%C.L. sensitivity equivalent to a neutrinoless double beta decay half life of 8.0x10E24a or better 50% of the time; if the experiment were run with neodymium enriched to 50% in 150Nd this limit improves to 57x10E24a. Under a reasonable choice for the 150Nd neutrinoless double beta decay matrix element, these half lives correspond to upper limits on the effective Majorana neutrino mass of 112 meV and 42 meV, respectively. These limits are competitive with those expected from all other near-term neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-10 21:07:00.25</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental and Numerical Investigation of Flame Acceleration in an Obstructed Channel</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Johansen, CRAIG</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The purpose of this study is to experimentally and numerically investigate flame acceleration in an obstructed channel. The motivation for this research is for the development of Pulse Detonation Engines (PDEs), which are unsteady propulsion devices that utilize the detonative mode of combustion. A literature survey on flame acceleration in the context of PDEs is presented, which covers a wide range of combustion regimes including laminar combustion, turbulent combustion, and finally detonation. An overview of current numerical modeling strategies is also presented along with a selection of recent numerical studies focused on flame acceleration in obstructed channels. Experimentally, the effect of obstacle blockage ratio on flame acceleration was investigated in a modular channel. The channel had a square cross-section and obstacles were mounted onto the top and bottom surfaces. Schlieren images were used to study the flame shape and the centerline flame velocity. A novel visualization technique has been developed to study the unburned gas flow ahead of the flame front. Flame propagation at speeds above the speed of sound in the reactants was also studied as compression waves formed in the unburned gas. It was found that shock reflection from obstacle surfaces and subsequent flame interaction dominates flame acceleration at these higher flame speeds. The unburned gas flow field ahead of the flame front was simulated using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and was compared to the visualization technique developed experimentally. The detailed unsteady calculation was used to further study the development of recirculation zones behind the obstacle surfaces and the generation of turbulence in the shear layers. The unburned gas flow field was investigated to give insight into the speed and shape of the flame as it propagates into these regions. Flame propagation was modeled using a flame surface density combustion model and simulations showed flame interactions with the turbulent flow field and how three-dimensional vortical structures augmented the flame shape and increase total area. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-21 10:10:36.38</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An Analysis of the 3-He Proportional Counter Data from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory Using Pulse Shape Discrimination</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Martin, RYAN</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents an independent analysis of the data from 3-He-filled proportional counters from the third phase of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) data. These counters were deployed in SNO's heavy water to independently detect neutrons produced by the neutral current interaction of 8-B solar neutrinos with deuterium. Previously published results from this phase were based on a spectral analysis of the energy deposited in the proportional counters. The work in this thesis introduces a new observable based on the time-profile of the ionization in the counters. The inclusion of this observable in a maximum-likelihood fit increases the potential to distinguish neutrons from backgrounds which are primarily due to alpha-decays. The combination of this new observable with the energy deposited in the counters results in a more accurate determination of the number of neutrons. The analysis presented in this thesis was limited to one third of the data from the proportional counters, uniformly distributed in time. This limitation was imposed to reconcile different time-lines between the submission of this thesis, a thorough review of this work by the SNO Collaboration and results from an independent analysis that is still underway. Analysis of this reduced data set determined that 398 +/- 29 (stat.) +/- 9 (sys.) neutrons were detected in this reduced data-set. The number compares well to the previous analysis of the data, based only on a spectral analysis of the deposited energy, which determined that 410 +/- 44 (stat.) +/- 9 (sys.) were detected in the same time period. The analysis presented here has led to a substantial increase in the statistical accuracy. Assuming that the statistical accuracy will increase when the full data set is analyzed, the results from this thesis would bring the uncertainty in the 8-B solar neutrino flux to down 6.8% from 8.5% in the previously published results. The work from the thesis is intended to be included in a future analysis of the SNO data and will result in a more accurate measurement of the total flux of solar neutrinos from 8-B as well as reduce the uncertainty in the $\theta_{12}$ neutrino oscillation mixing angle. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-16 15:56:28.195</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The energy calibration for the solar neutrino analysis of all three phases of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>MacLellan, Ryan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This work presents the calibration of the energy response of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO). The development of the energy response processor RSP and its use in setting the energy scale of SNO and reconstructing the energy of neutrino-like events is presented for each of the three phases of SNO: the pure heavy water phase, the salt phase, and the neutral current detector (NCD) phase. A 16N calibration source, producing mainly 6.13 MeV γ-rays, is the primary energy calibration source. It is used to set the energy scale of the detector and to test for errors in the energy calibration and reconstruction process. The errors associated with energy reconstruction in the pure heavy water and salt phase data, that is to be used in a low energy threshold solar 8B neutrino analysis, are derived for the RSP energy response processor and shown to be in agreement with other analyses. The largest of the errors, that associated with using the 16N source to set the energy scale of the detector, is improved through a detailed and thorough analysis. The calibration of the energy scale of the photomultiplier tube array in the third phase, with an array of 3He proportional counters (NCDs) distributed within the heavy water, is presented. The event energy reconstruction errors in the NCD phase are reassessed with more precise measurements and shown to be in agreement with the conservative estimates used in the analysis SNO presented in 2008. The implications of the improvements in the error are assessed and the solar 8B neutrino fluxes—charged current (CC), elastic scattering (ES), and neutral current (NC)—are determined to be: φCC = 1.68+0.09−0.07, φES = 1.79+0.25-0.22, and φNC = 5.52+0.48-0.45, in units of 10^6/cm^2/s. The errors quoted are the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties. These results are in good agreement with the results published by SNO in 2008 with a modest improvement in the CC measurement. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-23 01:40:45.237</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Gamma Calibration Using A New Test Apparatus At Queen’s University And Optimization Analyses For The PICASSO Experiment</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>LEVY, CECILIA</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The PICASSO experiment located 2 km underground in SNOLAB is directly searching for dark matter signals by looking for interactions between dark matter particles and an active target made of superheated droplets of freon C4F10. During the interaction, energy is deposited to the freon triggering a phase transition, inducing pressure waves which are detected by piezo-electric sensors. A temperature dependent analysis of the amplitudes of the signals for detector 71 showed that, above 25 ◦C, between 20 and 80 % of the events were saturated implying that the preamplifiers had too high a gain. Decreasing this gain by a fixed factor was not found to be a suitable solution to the problem. Ideally, a temperature dependent gain should be established. In addition, some channels have intrinsic problems and should be repaired. A threshold analysis was used to establish the trigger efficiency which was found to be 90% above 25 ◦C but only 50% at lower temperatures with the current setting of the threshold. A temperature dependent threshold setting has been proposed. A new setup at Queen’s University has been built and a gamma calibration using three different radioactive sources (22Na,137Cs,57Co) was undertaken leading to a new detector response curve for gammas. For a proper analysis, new and more appropriate cuts were implemented. The analysis confirmed the expectation that the PICASSO detectors are mostly blind to gammas below 50 ◦C. However, the detectors appear to be more sensitive to 122 keV gammas than to 622 keV gammas by a factor of about 10. The sensitivity for 22Na also differs by a large factor from what was expected from old calibrations on detectors with much smaller bubbles. The rate plots exhibit a strong exponential increase in rate above 40 ◦C which is not due to any of the gamma sources used, but could be due to neutrons or low energy x-rays. This remains under investigation. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-24 18:28:21.308</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Wavelength-Preserving Polarization-Insensitive All-Optical 3R Regenerator Based on Self- and Cross-Phase Modulation and Offset Filtering Utilizing Raman Amplification</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>CHUNG, SUNG HAN</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Optical regeneration has the potential to significantly increase the reach of long-haul transmission systems. In this thesis, wavelength-preserving polarization-insensitive all-optical 3R regeneration is investigated and demonstrated for 10 and 40 Gb/s signals. The all-optical regenerator utilizes a self-pulsating laser for clock recovery, cross-phase modulation (XPM) based spectral broadening in a highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) and offset filtering for retiming, and self-phase modulation based spectral broadening in a HNLF and offset filtering for reshaping. Raman amplification is used to increase the XPM-based spectral broadening and thus allow a design that meets the tradeoffs involved in simultaneously achieving good retiming and reshaping performance. The regenerator is shown to reduce amplitude noise and timing jitter while not causing a BER penalty. To fully validate the regeneration scheme, the cascadability is demonstrated using a recirculating loop. For a 10 Gb/s signal, with a regenerator spacing of 240 km, a return-to-zero, on-off-keyed (RZ-OOK) signal was transmitted over 18,000 km (75 loops) with a power penalty of 1.6 dB at a BER of 1E-9 compared to the back-to-back case. For a 40 Gb/s signal, with a regenerator spacing of 80 km, a RZ-OOK signal was transmitted over 8,000 km (100 loops) with a power penalty of 1.2 dB. In addition, all-optical 3R regeneration is demonstrated using a multimode quantum-dot Fabry Petot laser with ultra-low timing jitter. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-10-19 14:11:53.826</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Direct Numerical Simulation of Compressible and Incompressible Wall Bounded Turbulent Flows with Pressure Gradients</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wei, Liang</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis is focused on direct numerical simulation (DNS) of compressible and incompressible fully developed and developing turbulent flows between isothermal walls using a discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM). Three cases (Ma = 0.2, 0.7 and 1.5) of DNS of turbulent channel flows between isothermal walls with Re ~ 2800, based on bulk velocity and half channel width, have been carried out. It is found that a power law seems to scale mean streamwise velocity with Ma slightly better than the more usual log-law. Inner and outer scaling of second-order and higher-order statistics have been analyzed. The linkage between the pressure gradient and vorticity flux on the wall has been theoretically derived and confirmed and they are highly correlated very close to the wall. The correlation coefficients are influenced by Ma, and viscosity when Ma is high. The near-wall spanwise streak spacing increases with Ma. Isosurfaces of the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor are more sparsely distributed and elongated as Ma increases. DNS of turbulent isothermal-wall bounded flow subjected to favourable and adverse pressure gradient (FPG, APG) at Ma ~ 0.2 and Reref ~ 428000, based on the inlet bulk velocity and the streamwise length of the bottom wall, is also investigated. The FPG/APG is obtained by imposing a concave/convex curvature on the top wall of a plane channel. The flows on the bottom and top walls are tripped turbulent and laminar boundary layers, respectively. It is observed that the first and second order statistics are strongly influenced by the pressure gradients. The cross-correlation coefficients of the pressure gradients and vorticity flux remain constant across the FPG/APG regions of the flat wall. High correlations between the streamwise/wallnormal pressure gradient and the spanwise vorticity are found near the separation region close to the curved top wall. The angle of inclined hairpin structure to streamwise direction of the bottom wall is smaller (flatter) in the FPG region than the APG region. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-12-21 13:59:53.084</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Computational and Experimental Study of Surface Acoustic Waves in Phononic Crystals</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Petrus, Joseph Andrew</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The unique frequency range and robustness of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices has been a catalyst for their adoption as integral components in a range of consumer and military electronics. Furthermore, the strain and piezoelectric ﬁelds associated with SAWs are ﬁnding novel applications in nanostructured devices. In this thesis, the interaction of SAWs with periodic elastic structures, such as photonic or phononic crystals (PnCs), is studied both computationally and experimentally. To predict the behaviour of elastic waves in PnCs, a ﬁnite-difference time-domain simulator (PnCSim) was developed using C++. PnCSim was designed to calculate band structures and transmission spectra of elastic waves through two-dimensional PnCs. By developing appropriate boundary conditions, bulk waves, surface acoustic waves, and plate waves can be simulated. Results obtained using PnCSim demonstrate good agreement with theoretical data reported in the literature. To experimentally investigate the behaviour of SAWs in PnCs, fabrication procedures were developed to create interdigitated transducers (IDTs) and PnCs. Using lift-off photolithography, IDTs with ﬁnger widths as low as 1.8 um were fabricated on gallium arsenide (GaAs), corresponding to a SAW frequency of 397 MHz. A citric acid and hydrogen peroxide wet-etching solution was used to create shallow air hole PnCs in square and triangular lattice conﬁgurations, with lattice constants of 8 um and 12 um, respectively. The relative transmission of SAWs through these PnCs as a function of frequency was determined by comparing the insertion losses before and after etching the PnCs. In addition, using a scanning Sagnac interferometer, displacement maps were measured for SAWs incident on square lattice PnCs by Mathew (Creating and Imaging Surface Acoustic Waves on GaAs, Master’s Thesis). Reasonable agreement was found between simulations and measurements. Additional simulations indicate that SAW waveguiding should be possible with a PnC consiting of air holes in GaAs. The phononic properties of a commonly used photonic plate were also determined. Band structure simulations of the plate displayed no complete elastic band gaps. However, transmission simulations indicated that a pseudo-gap may form for elastic waves polarized in the sagittal plane. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-12-23 16:24:33.164</dc:description>

          <dc:title>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE THEORY, DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF MICROWAVE BANDPASS FILTERS</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bekheit, Maged</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Bandpass microwave filters are often modeled as a set of coupled discrete and localized resonators. This model is adequate in the narrow-band case. It, however, fails to describe accurately compact structures where stray couplings can be strong. To address this problem, a new view is proposed in this thesis. Instead of basing the model on localized discrete resonances, we start by constructing a model that is based on the global resonances of the structure. These are the resonances that the ports see and emerge when the entire structure is treated as a single unit. The resulting circuit, the transversal circuit, is universal. It is valid for any coupled resonator filter. The circuit is used in optimization of compact and ultra wideband suspended stripline filters and excellent results were obtained. In order to relate the global-eigen modes model to the conventional model, the issue of representation of microwave filters is investigated in detail. It is shown that a microwave filter can be represented by an infinite number of similar coupling matrices by using different modes as basis. According to this new view, a similarity transformation in microwave coupled resonator filters is interpreted as a change of basis. Two circuits that are related by a similarity transformation represent the same filter structure by using different sets of modes as basis. These conclusions were exploited in establishing a design theory for filters with dual-mode cavities. The new theory leads to direct and accurate design techniques that need no, or minimal, optimization. No tuning is used in the CAD steps. Tuning may only be required to account for manufacturing tolerances. A new tuning configuration is described and validated by computer simulation. A novel dual-mode filter with improved quality factor and reduced sensitivity is developed and designed within the same approach. The filter is fabricated and measured and excellent results are achieved. The same design methodology was used to introduce a new class of dual-mode dual-band microwave filters with improved sensitivity. It is also shown that canonical dual-mode filters can be designed within the same view with minimal local optimization of the input cavity. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-03-31 01:33:36.818</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dissipative Decomposition and Feedback Stabilization of Nonlinear Control Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hudon, Nicolas</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This dissertation considers the problem of approximate dissipative potentials construction and their use in smooth feedback stabilization of nonlinear control systems. For mechanical systems, dissipative potentials, usually a generalized Hamiltonian function, can be derived from physical intuition. When a dissipative Hamiltonian is not available, one can rely on dissipative Hamiltonian realization techniques, as proposed recently by Cheng and coworkers. Extensive results are available in the literature for (robust) stabilization based on the obtained potential. For systems of interest in chemical engineering, especially systems with mass action kinetics, energy is often ill-defined. Moreover, realization techniques are difficult to apply, due to the nonlinearities associated with the reaction terms. Approximate dissipative realization techniques have been considered by many researchers for analysis and feedback design of controllers in the context of chemical processes. The objective of this thesis is to study the construction of local dissipative potentials and their application to solve stabilization problems. The present work employs the geometric stabilization approach proposed by Jurdjevic and Quinn, refined by Faubourg and Pomet, and by Malisoff and Mazenc, for the design of stabilizing feedback laws. This thesis seeks to extend and apply the Jurdjevic--Quinn stabilization method to nonlinear stabilization problems, assuming no a priori knowledge of a Lyapunov function. A homotopy-based local decomposition method is first employed to study the dissipative Hamiltonian realization problem, leading to the construction of locally defined dissipative potentials. If the obtained potential satisfies locally the weak Jurdjevic--Quinn conditions, it is then shown how to construct feedback controllers using that potential, and under what conditions a Lyapunov function can be constructed locally for time-independent control affine systems. The proposed technique is then used for the construction of state feedback regulators and for the stabilization of periodic orbits based on a construction proposed by Bacciotti and Mazzi. In the last chapter of the thesis, stabilization of time-dependent control affine systems is considered, and the main result is used for the stabilization of periodic solutions using asymptotic feedback tracking. Low-dimensional examples are used throughout the thesis to illustrate the proposed techniques and results. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-06-17 10:13:42.201</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Symmetry Transforms, Global Plasma Equilibria and Homotopy Analysis Method</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Awais, Muhammad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) flows and equations have been the focus of a large number of researchers. Here a study of such flows and equations is presented. The first chapter contains a brief introduction to Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) along with some other definitions. A detailed example on the application of HAM is also included to further clarify the scheme of the method. Second chapter deals with a study of symmetry transforms for ideal MHD equations which comes from the work of Bogoyavlenskij [18]. Different properties of such transforms are also discussed which include the infinite-dimensional Abelian group formed by the symmetries, breaking of geometrical symmetries and ball lightning phenomenon. Next we review the recent work of Bogoyavlenskij [19] to present the derivation of exact plasma equilibria with axial and helical symmetries. Asymptotic and periodic nature of the obtained solutions has also been studied. The last chapter comprises of my own results and it deals with finding solution to unsteady thin film flow of a magnetohydrodynamic fluid. Governing equations of such flows are often very complex and nonlinear. So, we use Homotopy Analysis Method to find exact solution to such nonlinear equations. ; Thesis (Master, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2010-08-24 17:33:50.341</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experiments and Monte Carlo Analysis for the Optical Properties of the Scintillator in SNO+</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>LIU, XU</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The SNO+ experiment will be the SNO detector filled with a neodymium-loaded liquid scintillator instead of heavy water. SNO+ will be used to detect neutrinos of much lower energy. Also, SNO+ will conduct a search for neutrinoless double beta decay with Nd-150. The Nd-loaded scintillator in SNO+ will be made from linear alkylbenzene (LAB). Both the LAB solvent and the Nd loading are new developments. The optical properties of this scintillator and information about radioactive backgrounds should be studied. A calibration source known as the scintillator bucket was deployed in the water-filled SNO detector in order to study some optical properties of Nd-loaded scintillator, raw LAB scintillator and distilled LAB scintillator. Using a neutron source attached to the bucket to produce events with known energy, with a model of the scintillator bucket simulated by an analysis tool called RAT, the light yield of the scintillator could be determined by comparing data measurements with simulations. This allowed the light yield, one of the main optical properties of the scintillator, to be measured and that value to be corrected in the Monte Carlo. The bucket was deployed both at the centre of the detector and at the bottom. After subtracting backgrounds from radon introduced in the scintillator during preparation and filling, constraints on the amount of Po-210 were obtained. Estimates on the K-40 content of the Nd-loaded scintillator were obtained by analyzing the radon-subtracted background spectra. By comparing the background spectra with the bucket deployed at the bottom of the acrylic vessel with spectra from the bucket at the centre, it was possible to estimate the K-40 content of the acrylic vessel. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2010-09-22 11:55:44.351</dc:description>

          <dc:title>EFFECT OF COMPOSITION ON PERIPROSTHETIC FLUID RHEOLOGY AND FRICTION IN TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>FAM, Hala</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The present thesis investigates the friction properties of total knee replacement components using lubricating fluids of different composition and rheology. The first stage of the thesis involves characterization of the rheological properties of hyaluronic acid (HA)/bovine calf serum (BCS) solutions. With increased concentration and molecular weight of HA, higher viscosities and more pronounced shear thinning in steady shear flow was observed. In dynamic oscillatory flow, the elastic character of the solutions became more pronounced and the cross-over frequency decreased upon increasing concentration and molecular weight of HA. The second part of the thesis involves the determination of a method by which the coefficient of friction is estimated using a linear reciprocating wear testing machine with spherical metal indenters articulating on flat UHMWPE samples and deionised (D.I.) water lubrication. A characteristic periodic pattern in the friction behaviour was observed and the coefficient of friction was computed by calculating the average of 30 points about the midpoint between reversals and using the average of three cycles. The third part of the thesis involves the investigation of the effect of fluid composition on the coefficient of friction in knee replacement components. With increased concentration of HA in solution (0-1mg/mL), the coefficient of friction of HA/BCS solutions decreased. However, with HA/BCS solutions of higher HA concentrations (above 1mg/mL), no significant difference in the coefficient of friction was observed. Similar behavior was observed with HA/Albumin solutions. With HA/ D.I. water solutions, the coefficient of friction was almost identical irrespective of the concentration of HA in solution. Significant difference in the rheological properties of HA/D.I. water solutions did not affect the coefficient of friction. The Stribeck analysis revealed that the coefficient of friction with HA/BCS and HA/D.I. water lubrication was not governed by hydrodynamic conditions. The fourth part of this thesis involved characterization of lubricating fluids before and after friction testing. Absorbance and dynamic light scattering measurements of HA/BCS solutions and of HA/Albumin solutions indicate a rise in turbidity and the presence of larger size particles in these solutions after friction testing. The ninhydrin test confirmed the presence of protein in the precipitates obtained following testing. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-09-24 14:06:41.437</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Theory and simulation of separated boundary layers and turbulence induced secondary motion</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>RAIESI, Hassan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Among the different types of flows encountered in practical applications, the physics of turbulent separated flows and turbulence induced secondary motion are not fully understood despite the large amount of previous experimental and numerical work. The objectives of this work are to study theoretically and computationally the conditions at the separation and reattachment point, the numerical simulation of turbulence induced secondary motion in non-circular ducts, and to provide a comprehensive test of different RANS models of these types of flow. In a theoretical study of flow separation, a Lagrangian approach was first used to derive an Eulerian criterion, which associates separation and reattachment points to a critical point in the eigenvalues of the Cauchy-Green tensor. A turbulent separated boundary layer under the influence of an adverse pressure gradient was simulated using DNS and LES techniques. A bootstrapping method was used to obtain high fidelity results at a relatively high Reynolds number with which the performance of some of the most commonly used eddy-viscosity turbulence models was evaluated. The DNS and LES results were used to assess the consistency of the different terms in the k−e , ζ −f , k −ω and Spalart-Allmaras models. Different wall-modelling techniques were employed for the calculation of separated boundary layers. The exact values of the modelled terms were calculated using the reference DNS and LES dataset. These results were used for both a priori and a posteriori tests. It was determined that the eddy-viscosity assumption works well, and that anisotropic effects are not significant in separated boundary layer. For the secondary flow calculation in non-circular ducts, direct numerical simulations of turbulent flow in square and skewed ducts were carried out to determine the effect of the duct (rhombus) included angle on both the mean and turbulence energy budgets. Two skewed ducts, with included angles of 30 and 60 degrees, were simulated. The capability of different turbulence models to predict the secondary velocity field was investigated. Results obtained from a non-linear stress-strain constitutive relation was found to be fairly accurate for the flows at the range of Reynolds number considered in this study. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-11-26 13:52:18.361</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>REYNOLDS, A PATRICK</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We study the Hamiltonian structure of an important class of nonlinear partial differential equations: the so-called systems of hydrodynamic type, which are first-order in tempo-spatial variables, and quasi-linear. Chapters 1 and 2 constitute a review of background material, while Chapters 3, 4, 5 contain new results, with additional review sections as necessary. In Chapter 3 we demonstrate, via the Nijenhuis tensor, the integrability of a system of hydrodynamic type derived from the classical Volterra system. In Chapter 4, families of Hamiltonian structures of hydrodynamic type are constructed, as well as a gauge transform acting on Hamiltonian structures of hydrodynamic type. In Chapter 5, we present necessary and sufficient criteria for a three-component system of hydrodynamic type to be Hamiltonian, and classify the Lie-algebraic structures induced by a Hamiltonian structure for four-component systems of hydrodynamic type. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2010-12-23 11:35:41.976</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dynamics of Bose-Einstein Condensates in Josephson Junctions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Semple, Jaclyn</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We numerically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the Bogoliubov de Gennes equations for a double well potential in order to model the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a Josephson junction. First, the two dynamical regimes of the Josephson junction, that is, Josephson oscillations and self-trapping, are investigated under the application of a large sudden perturbation. It is found that the Josephson dynamics have a strong dependence on the strength of the interatomic interaction, and we observe the breakdown of the two-mode approximation. Second, we study the control of the dynamics through the use of a time-dependent, tilted double well potential. In the context of complete population transfer, the effect of the interactions on the adiabaticity and self-trapping is discussed in terms of a Landau-Zener-like model. We then explore the splitting of the condensate and the resulting dynamical behaviour by keeping the interaction strength constant, but changing the rate of the tilt sweep. Lastly, we examine the effect of the tilt sweep rate on the dynamics of population transfer. We observe a dependence of the self-trapping on the adiabaticity. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2011-01-10 16:31:43.127</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Geometric Aspects of Interconnection and Damping Assignment - Passivity-Based Control</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hoeffner, Kai</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This dissertation deals with smooth feedback stabilization of control-affine systems via Interconnection and Damping Assignment - Passivity-Based Control (IDA-PBC). The IDA-PBC methodology is a feedback control design technique that aims to establish or manipulate a port-Hamiltonian structure of the closed-loop system. For a mechanical control system, a port-Hamiltonian system is a natural description of the dynamics, and several effective controller designs have been presented for this class of systems. In other fields of engineering, the development of such controller design is an active area of research. In particular, applications of IDA-PBC techniques prove to be difficult in practice for process control applications where the concept of energy is usually ill-defined. This thesis seeks to extend the application of the IDA-PBC methodology beyond mechanical control systems. This is achieved by following three directions of research. First, we establish conditions under which a port-Hamiltonian system can be written as a feedback interconnection of two port-Hamiltonian system. We identify such an interconnection structure for linear control systems based on their intrinsic properties. Second, as observed in application of IDA-PBC to non-mechanical systems, several additional assumptions on the structure of the desired port-Hamiltonian system can effectively reduce the complexity of the matching problem. We establish a unified approach that considers these additional assumptions. Third, we connect the matching problem to the classical feedback equivalence approach. We show that feedback equivalence between control-affine systems can be employed to construct some feasible interconnection and damping structures. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-01-31 12:59:56.828</dc:description>

          <dc:title>DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF FLOW AND MASS TRANSFER IN SPACER-FILLED CHANNELS</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>MAHDAVIFAR, ALIREZA</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Spacer-filled channels are employed in membrane modules in many industrial applications where feed-flow spacers (employed to separate membrane sheets and create flow channels) tend to enhance mass transport characteristics, possibly mitigating fouling and concentration polarization phenomena. In this work direct numerical simulation was performed for the flow in the spacer-filled channels to obtain a better understanding of fluid flow and mass transfer phenomena in these channels. A solute with a Schmidt number of 1 at Reynolds numbers of 300, 500 and 800 (based on the bulk velocity and spacer diameter) was considered. The effect of spacer location was also studied for three different configurations, spacer at the centre of the channel, at off-centre location, and attached to the wall. Instantaneous velocity fields and flow structures such as separation of boundary layer on the walls and on the cylinder, eddies on the walls, recirculation regions and vortex shedding were investigated. A Fourier analysis was carried out on the time series velocity data. Using this analysis the Strouhal number was calculated and the development of the flow towards a broader turbulent state at higher Reynolds number was captured. Other statistical characteristics such as time-averaged velocities and wall shear rates are obtained and discussed. The average pressure loss which represents the operation cost of membrane modules was calculated for the channels and found to be highest for spacer at the centre of the channel and lowest for spacer attached to the wall. Scalar transport equation is directly solved along with Navier-Stokes equation to get the concentration field. Local Sherwood number is obtained on the walls and the relationship between shear stress, vortex shedding, and mass transfer enhancement was explored. The overall Sherwood number and Stanton number of the channels, which indicate the mass transfer performance of the channels, are obtained. It was observed that as spacer approaches the wall mass transfer rate is decreasing. ; Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-11-30 11:44:07.479</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Mathematical Discussion of Corotational Finite Element Modeling</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>CRAIGHEAD, John Wesley</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis discusses the mathematics of the Element Independent Corotational (EICR) Method and the more general Unified Small-Strain Corotational Formulation. The former was developed by Rankin, Brogan and Nour-Omid [106]. The latter, created by Felippa and Haugen [49], provides a theoretical frame work for the EICR and similar methods and its own enhanced methods. The EICR and similar corotational methods analyse non-linear deformation of a body by its discretization into finite elements, each with an orthogonal frame rotating (and translating) with the element. Such methods are well suited to deformations where non-linearity arises from rigid body deformation but local strains are small (1-4%) and so suited to linear analysis. This thesis focuses on such small-strain, non-linear deformations. The key concept in small-strain corotational methods is the separation of deformation into its rigid body and elastic components. The elastic component then can be analyzed linearly. Assuming rigid translation is removed first, this separation can be viewed as a polar decomposition (F = vR) of the deformation gradient (F) into a rigid rotation (R) followed by a small, approximately linear, stretch (v). This stretch usually causes shear as well as pure stretch. Using linear algebra, Chapter 3 explains the EICR Method and Unified Small-Strain Corotational Formulation initially without, and then with, the projector operator, reflecting their historical development. Projectors are orthogonal projections which simplify the isolation of elastic deformation and improve element strain invariance to rigid body deformation. Turning to Lie theory, Chapter 4 summarizes and applies relevant Lie theory to explore rigid and elastic deformation, finite element methods in general, and the EICR Method in particular. Rigid body deformation from a Lie perspective is well represented in the literature which is summarized. A less developed but emerging area in differential geometry (notably, Marsden/Hughes [82]), elastic deformation is discussed thoroughly followed by various Lie aspects of finite element analysis. Finally, the EICR Method is explored using Lie theory. Given the available research, complexity of the area, and level of this thesis, this exploration is less developed than the earlier linear algebraic discussion, but offers a useful alternative perspective on corotational methods. ; Thesis (Master, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2011-03-30 21:40:25.831</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Synthesis and Design of Novel Dual-Mode Microwave Filters</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wahby, Mahmoud</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis describes the synthesis and design of two novel dual-mode microwave waveguide filter structures. The mode degeneracy is fundamental to this design technique. The first design introduces a structurally symmetric dual-mode cavity pseudo-elliptic band-pass filter, which has been implemented by only asymmetric structures so far. It is also used to shed light on the concepts of positive and negative coupling in dual-mode filters. A novel iris coupling structure is investigated allowing negative coupling coefficients required for certain polarizations of modes in dual- mode rectangular cavities. A 4th order dual-mode band-pass filter is designed at 11 GHz with a bandwidth of 200 MHz, an in-band return loss of 20dB and two transmission zeros at normalized frequencies of ±1.6. The filter makes use of the negative coupling property of the iris for inter-resonance coupling of the modes of horizontal orientation inside the cavity. The desired performance of the filter was achieved by the initial design without any optimization. The second design is especially convenient when temperature compensation is of prime concern. A direct design technique is developed and demonstrated with computer simulation and measurement in circular waveguide technology on a 4th order filter with a bandwidth of 50 MHz at 11 GHz, an in-band return loss of 20 dB and two normalized transmission zeros at ±1.5. ; Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-04-08 12:41:14.602</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Excitonic Analysis of Many-Body Effects on the 1s−2p Intraband Transition in Semiconductor Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>PARKS, Andrew Marshall</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>I present a detailed study of many-body effects associated with the interband 1s transition and intraband 1s-2p transition in two- and three-dimensional photo-excited semiconductors. I employ a previously developed excitonic model to treat effects of exchange and phase space filling. I extend the scope of the model to include static free-carrier screening. I also develop a factorization scheme to obtain a consistent set of excitonic dynamical equations. The exciton transition energies are renormalized by many-body interactions, and the excitonic dynamical equations provide simple expressions for the individual contributions of screening, phase space filling and exchange. The effects of exchange and phase space filling are quantified by a set of excitonic coefficients. I first calculate these coefficients analytically by omitting screening effects. In contrast, the screened coefficients involve multi-dimensional integrals which must be evaluated numerically. I present a detailed discussion of the numerical methods used to evaluate these integrals, which include a novel algorithm for segmenting multi-dimensional integration regions. The excitonic model correctly predicts the blue shift and bleaching of the 1s exciton resonance due to exchange and phase space filling. Free-carrier screening is found to enhance these effects by lowering the exciton binding energy. In contrast, the effects of free-carrier screening on the 1s-2p transition energy are more subtle. In the absence of free-carrier screening, exchange and phase space filling lead to a blue shift of the transition energy. However, screening decreases the 1s binding energy faster than the 2p binding energy, which in turn decreases the transition energy. Thus, screening effects oppose exchange and phase space filling, and the overall magnitude and sign of the 1s-2p transition energy shift depends on the free-carrier density. Specifically, for low-moderate excitation densities exchange and phase space filling can be dominated by screening, leading to a net red shift of the transition energy. The results for two- and three-dimensional systems are qualitatively similar, although the magnitudes of the shifts are much smaller in three dimensions. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2011-05-31 15:58:27.222</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Developing Single-Laser Sources for Multimodal Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering Microscopy</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>PEGORARO, ADRIAN FRANK</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy has developed rapidly and is opening the door to new types of experiments. This work describes the development of new laser sources for CARS microscopy and their use for different applications. It is specifically focused on multimodal nonlinear optical microscopy—the simultaneous combination of different imaging techniques. This allows us to address a diverse range of applications, such as the study of biomaterials, fluid inclusions, atherosclerosis, hepatitis C infection in cells, and ice formation in cells. For these applications new laser sources are developed that allow for practical multimodal imaging. For example, it is shown that using a single Ti:sapphire oscillator with a photonic crystal fiber, it is possible to develop a versatile multimodal imaging system using optimally chirped laser pulses. This system can perform simultaneous two photon excited fluorescence, second harmonic generation, and CARS microscopy. The versatility of the system is further demonstrated by showing that it is possible to probe different Raman modes using CARS microscopy simply by changing a time delay between the excitation beams. Using optimally chirped pulses also enables further simplification of the laser system required by using a single fiber laser combined with nonlinear optical fibers to perform effective multimodal imaging. While these sources are useful for practical multimodal imaging, it is believed that for further improvements in CARS microscopy sensitivity, new excitation schemes are necessary. This has led to the design of a new, high power, extended cavity oscillator that should be capable of implementing new excitation schemes for CARS microscopy as well as other techniques. Our interest in multimodal imaging has led us to other areas of research as well. For example, a fiber-coupling scheme for signal collection in the forward direction is demonstrated that allows for fluorescence lifetime imaging without significant temporal distortion. Also highlighted is an imaging artifact that is unique to CARS microscopy that can alter image interpretation, especially when using multimodal imaging. By combining expertise in nonlinear optics, laser development, fiber optics, and microscopy, we have developed systems and techniques that will be of benefit for multimodal CARS microscopy. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2011-08-11 13:46:26.065</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Effect of Disorder on Strongly Correlated Electrons</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>FARHOODFAR, AVID</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis is devoted to a study of the effect of disorder on strongly correlated electrons. For non-interacting electrons, Anderson localization occurs if the amount of disorder is sufficient. For disorder-free systems, a Mott metal-insulator transition may occur if the electron-electron interactions are strong enough. The question we ask in this thesis is what happens when both disorder and interactions are present. We study the Anderson-Hubbard model, which is the simplest model to include both interactions and disorder, using a Gutzwiller variational wave function approach. We then study Anderson localization of electrons from the response of the Anderson-Hubbard Hamiltonian to an external magnetic field. An Aharonov-Bohm flux induces a persistent current in mesoscopic rings. Strong interactions result in two competing tendencies: they tend to suppress the current because of strong correlations, and they also screen the disorder potential and making the system more homogenous. We find that, for strongly interacting electrons, the localization length may be large, even though the current is suppressed by strong correlations. This unexpected result highlights how strongly correlated materials can be quiet di erent from weakly correlated ones. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2011-08-31 09:51:47.155</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Probing Molecular Dynamics with Non-Linear Optical Techniques</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>LAUSTEN, RUNE</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The dynamics of molecules in the gas and liquid phase is investigated using ultrafast optical techniques. The development of sub-25 fs ultrafast sources using noncollinear optical parametric amplification is discussed. These intense pulses are utilized in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering to investigate vibrational motion in I2 Br2 and IBr. For larger bio-molecules relevant dynamics may not be related to the absorption of light. Here, a new technique is introduced, in which an optically excitable molecule is incorporated into the bio-molecule. Photoisomerization of the trigger molecule initiates structural rearrangement in the larger system. To demonstrate this approach, azobenzene was synthesized into short strands of DNA to time-resolve base pair destacking dynamics and DNA melting. The isomerization of azobenzene in thin polymer films (and their corresponding change in optical properties) was also used to write birefringence and surface relief gratings. This method was used to demonstrate a rewritable Bragg filter for telecom wavelengths. Lastly, an alternative to typical crystal based wavemixing is presented for the generation of ultrafast tunable ultraviolet and deep ultraviolet pulses. The approach utilizes difference frequency four wave mixing in hollow waveguides filled with noble gas. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2011-08-31 14:55:11.636</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Validation of the Lattice Boltzmann Method for Direct Numerical Simulation of Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>BESPALKO, DUSTIN JOHN</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this work, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) was validated for direct numerical simulation (DNS) of wall-bounded turbulent flows. The LBM is a discrete-particle-based method that numerically solves the Boltzmann equation as opposed to conventional DNS methods that are based on the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. The advantages of the LBM are its simple implementation, its ability to handle complex geometries, and its scalability on modern high-performance computers. An LBM code was developed and used to simulate fully-developed turbulent channel flow. In order to validate the results, the turbulence statistics were compared to those calculated from a conventional NS-based finite difference (FD) simulation. In the present study, special care was taken to make sure the computational domains for LBM and FD simulations were the same. Similar validation studies in the literature have used LBM simulations with smaller computational domains in order to reduce the computational cost. However, reducing the size of the computational domain affects the turbulence statistics and confounds the results of the validation. The turbulence statistics calculated from the LBM and FD simulations were found to agree qualitatively; however, there were several significant deviations, particularly in the variance profiles. The largest discrepancy was in the variance of the pressure fluctuations, which differed by approximately 7%. Given that both the LBM and FD simulations resolved the full range of turbulent scales and no models were used, this error was deemed to be significant. The cause of the discrepancy in the pressure variance was found to be the compressibility of the LBM. The LBM allows the density to vary, while the FD method does not since it solves the incompressible form of the NS equations. The effect of the compressibility could be reduced by lowering the Mach number, but this would come at the cost of significantly increasing the computational cost. Therefore, the conclusion of this work is that, while the LBM is capable of producing accurate solutions for incompressible turbulent flows, it is significantly more expensive than conventional methods for simple wall-bounded turbulent flows. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-15 23:24:09.968</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Characterization of Electrochemically Formed Coloured Passive Layers on Titanium and Zirconium: Optical, Surface and Corrosion Properties</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Holmberg, Rebecca</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Electrochemically formed passive layers on titanium and zirconium, and their optical, surface and corrosion properties are presented. With the use of higher applied AC voltages, the passive layers become thicker and more protective of the underlying metal, as determined from thickness measurements by scanning electron microscopy and focused ion beam instruments, as well as passive layer corrosion resistance measurements by electrochemical polarization curve and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry experiments. The surface morphology of all samples was studied with atomic force microscopy, profilometry, visible light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and finally electron backscattered diffraction experiments. The passive layers were found to be uniform in their surface structure with no cracks or fractures. However, the samples prepared at VAC = 60-80 V showed defects, which were increasingly prevalent at higher VAC. These defects are thought to be attributed to a process of localized electrochemical breakdown. The aforementioned increase in corrosion resistance is in spite of the defects, which were observed for the samples prepared at VAC = 60-80 V. Surface morphology, in relation to optical properties, was also investigated through reflectance spectroscopy measurements. A correlation between grain colouration and light reflected from the sample surface was observed through measurements using visible light microscopy as well as near infrared ultraviolet visible reflectance spectroscopy. These experiments showed a red-shift of wavelength maxima (λmax) values as voltages, and therefore thickness, were increased. This is the reason that different colours are seen for different thicknesses; the red shift causes different wavelengths to be reflected constructively and destructively. Overall, these passive layers are protective of an already remarkable metal and, with greater knowledge of their properties, their potential may be observed in a wide range of applications. ; Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-19 19:44:07.148</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A numerical study of the effect of a venetian blind on the convective heat transfer rate from a recessed window with transitional and turbulent flow</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>OGHBAIE, SHAGHAYEGH</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The presence of a blind adjacent to a window affects the natural convective air flow over the window and natural convective heat transfer from the window to the room. Most numerical studies of convective heat transfer between a window-blind system and a room are based on the assumption that the flow remains laminar. However, in the case of larger windows it is to be expected that transition to turbulent flow will occur in the flow over the window. The aim of the present study was to numerically determine the effect of Venetian blind on laminar-to-turbulent transition in the flow over a simple recessed window and on the convective heat transfer from the window. An approximate model of a recessed window that is covered by a venetian blind has been considered. The fluid properties have been assumed constant except for the density change with temperature that gives rise to the buoyancy forces, this being dealt with using the Boussinesq approach. Radiant and conductive heat transfer effects have been neglected. However in the present study the case where there is a constant heat generation rate in the blind slats, as the result of solar radiation absorbed by the slats of the blind, has been considered. The k-epsilon turbulence model with the full effects of the buoyancy forces being accounted for has been used in obtaining the solution. The turbulent, steady and two dimensional governing equations have been solved using the commercial finite-volume based CFD code FLUENT. Results are generated for different blind slat angles, for different distances of the pivot point of the slats from the window and for different constant heat generation rates in the slats. The results show that over a wide range of Rayleigh number, the distance of the blind to the window has a stronger effect on the convective heat transfer from the window and also on the laminar to turbulent transition in the flow over the window than the blind slat angle. Heat generation in the slats increases the Mean Nusselt number and this effect increases as the Rayleigh number decreases. ; Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-22 21:17:31.777</dc:description>

          <dc:title>DETECTION OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS USING AMPLIFIED FIBER LOOP RING-DOWN SPECTROSCOPY</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>LITMAN, JESSICA</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) is an absorption spectroscopic technique. In CRDS the concentration of an analyte is determined by measuring the reduction in finesse of an optical cavity made from two highly reflective (R&gt;99.9%) mirrors once a sample is introduced. Optical loss is traditionally determined from the exponential intensity decay of a short laser pulse that was injected into the cavity. This decay is the longest for an empty, high finesse cavity and is reduced when the sample absorbs or scatters light. In this project, the optical cavity is made from fiber optic waveguides and the light source is a continuous wave (cw) diode laser. It is used to detect analytes such as acetylene, ammonia and other amines through their overtone absorption in the telecom region at 1500 nm. The experiment is done by increasing the ratio of desired loss (extinction caused by the sample), to undesirable loss (from the waveguide or solvents) through amplification of the ringdown signal using an erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). The EDFA is inserted into a fiber-optic loop and its gain is increased above the lasing threshold. The gain of the, now lasing, fiber loop is "clamped" to a high and constant value, thereby removing unwanted gain fluctuations, and all losses in the loop are compensated for. If one now inserts a laser light pulse at the lasing wavelength of the loop it would circulate through the loop indefinitely, whereas a light pulse at a wavelength that is being absorbed by an analyte would experience a decrease with time at a rate that depends only on the magnitude of the sample absorption. By enclosing the sample gap with a gas cell both acetylene and ammonia have been detected down to ~25 ppm and ~5.9 Torr respectively. Subsequently, a 1% solution of aminotoluene was detected in an interrogation volume of 5.65 pL by having inserted a fiber with a hole drilled in it as the sample gap. At present, the drilled fiber has been replaced with photonic crystal fiber such that small volumes of gases may be detected with a longer effective path length. ; Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-23 18:27:47.65</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Optical Characterization of Indium Gallium Nitride for Application in High-Efficiency Solar Photovoltaic Cells</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>MCLAUGHLIN, DIRK</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The semiconductor alloy indium gallium nitride (InxGa1-xN) offers substantial potential in the development of high-efficiency multi-junction photovoltaic devices due to its wide range of direct band gaps, strong absorption and other optoelectronic properties. This work uses a variety of characterization techniques to examine the properties of InxGa1-xN thin films deposited in a range of compositions by a novel plasma-enhanced evaporation deposition system. Due to the high vapour pressure and low dissociation temperature of indium, the indium incorporation and, ultimately, control of the InxGa1-xN composition was found to be influenced to a greater degree by deposition temperature than variations in the In:Ga source rates in the investigated region of deposition condition space. Under specific deposition conditions, crystalline films were grown in an advantageous nano-columnar microstructure with deposition temperature influencing column size and density. The InxGa1-xN films were determined to have very strong absorption coefficients with band gaps indirectly related to indium content. However, the films also suffer from compositional inhomogeneity and In-related defect complexes with strong phonon coupling that dominates the emission mechanism. This, in addition to the presence of metal impurities, harms the alloy’s electronic properties as no significant photoresponse was observed. This research has demonstrated the material properties that make the InxGa1-xN alloy attractive for multi-junction solar cells and the benefits/drawbacks of the plasma-enhanced evaporation deposition system. Future work is needed to overcome significant challenges relating to crystalline quality, compositional homogeneity and the optoelectronic properties of In-rich InxGa1-xN films in order to develop high-performance photovoltaic devices. ; Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-09-29 21:28:58.898</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Large-Eddy Simulations of Accelerating Boundary Layer Flows Over Rough Surfaces</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>YUAN, JUNLIN</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Large-eddy simulations are carried out to study the combined effects of roughness and favourable pressure gradient in boundary layer flows, where the high acceleration (on smooth walls) may cause flow reversion to the quasi-laminar state. A sand-grain roughness model is used, with the no-slip boundary condition modeled by an immersed boundary method. The properties and accuracies of the scheme are studied, the roughness model is validated, and the spatial-resolution requirements are determined. The roughness model is applied to boundary layers subject to mild or strong acceleration, with simulations carried out underlining the effects of three parameters: the acceleration parameter, the roughness height, and the inlet Reynolds number. The roughness effects are limited to the roughness sublayer; the outer layer is affected indirectly only, through the changes that roughness causes in the relaminarization and retransition processes. The roughness significantly affects the inner-layer quantities like the friction velocity and the friction coefficient, while the local Reynolds number, the outer-layer mean velocity, as well as the Reynolds stresses beyond the roughness sublayer, are not sensitive to the roughness. The acceleration decreases the Reynolds stresses in the overlap region and promotes a laminar-like velocity profile. The acceleration leads to stabilization of near-wall structures and causes one-dimensional turbulence. The roughness generates small-scale structures at the bottom wall, which disturb the larger structures originally stabilized by the pressure gradient, leading to a decrease in the Reynolds-stress anisotropy. Roughness increases the Reynolds stresses in the roughness sublayer and tends to restore the fully turbulence flow early. The inlet Reynolds number affects the flow stability by determining the viscous length scale compared to the roughness length scales, and by determining how far the roughness effect extents into the boundary layer. ; Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-10-17 11:19:08.063</dc:description>

          <dc:title>High-Speed Electronic Signal Processing for Pre-Compensation in Optical Communications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>JIANG, YING</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Narrowband optical filtering and chromatic dispersion are two important issues that affect optical fiber transmission performance. Recent technological developments in high-speed digital signal processors, digital-to-analog converters and analog-to-digital converters have enabled the implementation of electronic signal processing (ESP) in optical transmission systems leading to adaptive and cost efficient integrated solutions. This thesis focuses on applying ESP at the transmitter to pre-compensate for narrowband optical filtering and chromatic dispersion. A novel electronic pre-compensation approach was proposed to deal with narrowband optical filtering. The effectiveness was demonstrated by a straight-line experiment and a recirculating loop experiment for 10 Gb/s non-return-to-zero on-off-keying (NRZ-OOK). Moreover, the work was extended to NRZ differential-phase-shift-keying as well as 20 Gb/s NRZ differential-quadrature-phase-shift-keying. Experimental results demonstrate that electronic pre-compensation effectively reduces the degradation in system performance induced by narrowband optical filtering. Electronic dispersion pre-compensation was investigated using a semiconductor InP Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) for the NRZ-OOK modulation format at 10.709 Gb/s aiming at providing a cost efficient implementation for core and metro transmission networks. A brute-force method was developed to determine the requisite drive i voltages due to the nonlinear voltage dependent attenuation and phase constants of the InP MZM. The transmission results for the recirculating loop and straightline experiments demonstrate that an InP MZM provides comparable dispersion precompensation performance with a conventional LiNbO3 MZM. Use of the NRZ-OOK modulation format and InP MZM provides a simple and cost-efficient solution for core and metro transmission network. Dispersion pre-compensation was also performed for a 85.672 Gb/s polarization multiplexed 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (PM-16QAM) modulation format with digital coherent detection and offline digital signal processing. The transmitter was characterized to ensure the quality of the 16QAM signal generation. Simulation results indicate the impact of the modulator bias voltage error on system performance. Recirculating loop experimental results demonstrate that the performance of dispersion pre-compensation is comparable with dispersion post-compensation, thus providing the possibility to combine dispersion pre- and post-compensation for PM- 16QAM coherent transmission for further performance improvement. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-10-29 13:01:01.347</dc:description>

          <dc:title>DYNAMICS OF INTERNAL SOLITARY WAVE AND BOTTOM BOUNDARY INTERACTION</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>AGHSAEE, PAYAM</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The breaking of internal solitary waves (ISWs) of depression shoaling upon a uniformly sloping boundary in a smoothed two-layer density field was investigated using high-resolution two-dimensional simulations. The simulations were performed for a wide range of boundary slopes S∈[0.01,0.3] and wave slopes. Over steep slopes (S≥0.1), three distinct breaking processes were observed; surging, plunging and collapsing breakers which are associated with reflection, convective instability and boundary layer separation, respectively. Over mild slopes (S≤0.05), nonlinearity varies gradually and the wave fissions into a train of waves of elevation after it passes through the turning point where solitary waves reverse polarity. The dynamics of each breaker type were investigated and the predominance of a particular mechanism was associated with a relative developmental timescale. The breaker type was characterized in wave slope S_w versus S space and the reflection coefficient (R), modeled as a function of the internal Iribarren number, was in agreement with other studies. The same 2D model was applied to investigate boundary layer separation-driven global instability, which is shown to play an important role in breaking of shoaling ISWs. The simulations were conducted with waves propagating over a flat bottom and shoaling over relatively mild (S=0.05) and steep (S=0.1) slopes. Combining the results over flat and sloping boundaries, a unified criterion for vortex shedding is proposed, which depends on the momentum thickness Reynolds number and the non-dimensionalized ISW-induced pressure gradient at the point of separation. The criterion is generalized to a form that may be readily computed from field data and compared to published laboratory and field observations. During vortex shedding, the bed shear stress, vertical velocity and near-bed Reynolds stress were elevated, implying potential for sediment re-suspension. Laboratory experiments were also performed to study three-dimensionality (3D) of global instability. Our results agree with previous laboratory experiments, using the proposed pressure gradient parameter and Reynolds number. The 3D effects prevent the vortices from ascending as high as they do in 2D simulations. The instabilities were not able to re-suspend sediments with 20 µm median diameters, which suggests applying lighter sediments, as finer sediments will be cohesive and dynamically different. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2011-12-23 15:03:29.76</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dyadic Green Functions and their applications in Classical and Quantum Nanophotonics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>VAN VLACK, COLE PERCY</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Research in solid-state nanophotonics and quantum optics has been recently pushing the limits in semiconductor microcavity design. High quality microcavities that confine light into small volumes are now able to drastically alter the local density of states (LDOS). Plasmonic systems can provide smaller effective confinements, however it is unclear if the benefits of confinement are good enough to balance material losses due to non-radiative processes. This thesis presents a compendium of techniques for calculating photonic Green functions in various lossy, inhomogeneous magneto-dielectric systems. Subsequently we derive a rigorous theory of quantum light-matter interactions, valid in both weak and strong coupling limits, and show how the classical photonic Green function is developed to calculate Purcell factors, Lamb shifts, and the near and far field spectra from a single photon emitter. Using these techniques, this work investigates the classical and quantum optical properties of a variety of inhomogeneous structures, including their coupling to single photon emitters. This includes examining Purcell factors above negative index slabs and showing the convergence of many slow-light modes leads to a drastic increase in the LDOS along with large Lamb shifts. The optical trapping of metallic nanoparticles is examined above a negative index slab and a silver half-space, showing the importance of interparticle coupling on the optical forces. Then the interaction between a quantum dot and a metallic nanoparticle is studied where far-field strong coupling effects are observed only when the metallic nanoparticle is considered beyond the dipole approximation. Finally, this work addresses the issue of the LDOS diverging in lossy materials, which necessitates a description of spontaneous emission beyond the dipole approximation; the ``local field problem'' in quantum optics is revisited and generalized to include local field corrections for use in any photonic medium. The strength of finite-difference time-domain techniques is demonstrated in a number of cases for the calculation of regularized Green functions in lossy inhomogeneous media. This thesis presents a comprehensive study of Green function approaches to model classical and quantum light-matter interactions in arbitrary nanophotonic structures, including quantum dots, semiconductor microcavities, negative index waveguides, metallic half-spaces and metallic nanoparticles. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2012-04-26 15:25:53.178</dc:description>

          <dc:title>EFFECTS OF INITIAL CONDITIONS ON TURBULENCE LENGTH SCALE AND ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE NEAR TO INTERMEDIATE FIELD OF A ROUND FREE JET</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sadeghi, Hamed</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis examines the effects of spatial location, Reynolds number and near exit flow modification on the development region of a round, free, turbulent jet. It is based on the publications generated by the author. The experiments were carried out over the range of Reynolds numbers between 10000 &lt; ReD &lt; 50000, where ReD is calculated based on the jet exit mean velocity and the nozzle exit diameter. The measurements were performed in the near- to intermediate-field region of a free jet defined between 0 ≤ x/D ≤ 30. In order to control the flow near the exit, two wire rings, with square cross-sections, of sides h = 1.5 mm, and outer diameter Dwire = 71.6 mm (positioned in the shear layer and called Rsl) and Dwire = 60 mm (positioned in the potential core and called Rpc) were placed at a stand-off distance downstream of the jet nozzle exit plane x/D = 0.03. Both stationary and flying hot wires were used to investigate the jet flow field. The results showed a considerable reduction in the jet spread rate and turbulence intensity using the passive rings. The reduction in the velocity decay rate was more obvious in the case of Rsl in lower Re; however, it was observed that as Re increases, the velocity decay rate became nearly the same for both cases of Rsl and Rpc. The axial velocity spectra showed the initial shear layer instability (shear layer mode) was suppressed while the jet preferred instability (preferred mode) remained active as the shear layer and potential core were modified. This shows the separation of these modes and is at variance with ideas that appeared in the literature that claimed the dependency of these two modes. ; Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2012-04-27 16:06:31.03</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Bifurcations of Periodic Solutions of Functional Differential Equations with Spatio-Temporal Symmetries</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Collera, JUANCHO</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We study bifurcations of periodic solutions with spatio-temporal symmetries of functional differential equations (FDEs). The two main results are: (1) a centre manifold reduction around a periodic solution of FDEs with spatio-temporal symmetries, and (2) symmetry-breaking bifurcations for symmetric rings of delay-coupled lasers. For the case of ODEs, symmetry-breaking bifurcations from periodic solutions has already been studied. We extend this result to the case of symmetric FDEs using a Centre Manifold Theorem for symmetric FDEs which reduces FDEs into ODEs on an integral manifold around a periodic solution. We show that the integral manifold is invariant under the spatio-temporal symmetries which guarantees that the symmetry structure of the system of FDEs is preserved by this reduction. We also consider a problem in rings of delay-coupled lasers modeled using the Lang-Kobayashi rate equations. We classify the symmetry of bifurcating branches of solutions from steady-state and Hopf bifurcations that occur in 3-laser systems. This involves finding isotropy subgroups of the symmetry group of the system, and then using the Equivariant Branching Lemma and the Equivariant Hopf Theorem. We then utilize this result to find the bifurcating branches of solutions in DDE-Biftool. Symmetry often causes eigenvalues to have multiplicity, and in some cases, this could lead DDE-Biftool to incorrectly predict the bifurcation points. We address this issue by developing a method of finding bifurcation points which can be used for the general case of n-laser systems with unidirectional and bidirectional coupling. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2012-04-30 11:25:01.011</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Volume of Black Holes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ballik, William John Victor</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The invariant four-volume ($\mathcal V$) of a complete four-dimensional black hole (the volume of the spacetime at and interior to the horizon) diverges. However, if one considers the black hole resulting from the gravitational collapse of an object and integrates only a finite time to the future of the collapse, the resultant volume is well-defined and finite. We show that for non-degenerate black holes, the volume in this case can be written as $\mathcal V \propto \ln|\lambda|$, where lambda is the affine generator of the horizon and we define our volume $\mathcal V^*$ to be the constant of proportionality. In spherical symmetry, this is the Euclidean volume divided by the surface gravity ($\kappa$). More generally, it turns out that $\mathcal V^*$ is the Parikh volume $({}^3 \mathcal V^*)$ divided by $\kappa$. This allows us to define an alternative local and invariant definition of the surface gravity of a stationary black hole. It also encourages us to find a generalization of the Parikh volume (which depends on the existence of an asymptotically timelike Killing vector) to any region of space or spacetime of arbitrary dimension, provided that this space or spacetime contains a Killing vector. We find some properties of this generalized ``Killing volume'' and rewrite our volume as a Killing volume for a particular Killing vector. We revisit the laws of black hole mechanics, considering them in terms of volumes rather than areas, by writing out our volume and the Parikh volume of Kerr-Newman black holes and then considering their variation with respect to the parameters $M$, $J$ and $Q$ to find a modified BH mechanics first law. We also use our new definition of $\kappa$ to develop an alternate demonstration of the BH mechanics third law. We note that the Parikh volume of a Kerr-Newman black hole is equal to $A r_+/3$, where $A$ is the horizon surface area and $r_+$ the value of the radius at the horizon, and we offer some interpretations of this relationship. We review some other relevant work by Parikh as well as some by Cveti\v{c} et al. and by Hayward. We point out some possible next steps to follow up on the work in this thesis. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2012-06-04 15:58:03.984</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Effect of Waveform Shape on Dynamics and Kinematics of the Flow in Endovascular Stents</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rouhi, Amirreza</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The effect of waveform shape and extension of negative flowrate are studied at two Reynolds numbers (Re = 80, Re = 200) on stented channels by looking at the kinematics and dynamics of the flow. The waveforms are reconstructed by Fourier decomposition of a waveform corresponding to left anterior descending (LAD) of coronary artery. The stents are modeled by an immersed boundary method. Two stent geometries are created which are the idealizations of two clinical ones. The first geometry is an idealization of XIENCE V stent which is called Lambda stent and the second one is the idealization of Endeavor stent and is called X stent. The former has larger inter-strut spacing and smaller thickness than the latter one. The use of immersed boundary method for creating the stents is validated, and the spatial resolution requirements are determined. The shape of the waveform is changed by systematically filtering out the higher modes of Fourier decomposition and the negative flowrate extension is reduced by shifting the waveform to the positive flowrate. The presence of the stent causes vortical structures to be created between stent struts. These vortices are migrating to the centre of the channel and disappear. It is observed that the confined geometric feature of X stent and its larger thickness, leads to larger areas of flow recirculation which causes smaller wall-shear-stress parameters with respect to Lambda stent and more deviation of the flow from a healthy vessel. The importance of the convective terms of the Navier-Stokes equations was studied at the two Reynolds numbers for both stents. It is observed that at high Reynolds number (Re = 200), the convective terms play significant role throughout the waveform cycle while at low Reynolds number (Re = 80), the effect of convective terms become negligible during negative flowrate. Moreover the convective terms become more significant for flow in a channel with Lambda stent than X stent due to the specific shape and size of the stents. The kinematics of the flow corresponds to the study of vortex timing. It was found that this timing is mainly affected by the waveform and Reynolds number rather than the stent geometry. The time at which vortex creation occurs is coincident with the time at which wall shear stress changes its sign in an unstented channel. Therefore the analytical solution of unsteady channel flow can be used as a tool for analysing the kinematics of the flow, ; Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2012-06-07 17:41:52.501</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Optically Active Chiral Mediums Fabricated with Glancing Angle Deposition</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yang, Jian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Optically active helical microparticles are studied in the forms of thin films, suspensions and powders. From fabricated helical porous thin films, microparticle suspensions are obtained by removing the microparticles (film columns) from their substrates and dispersing them into water. For removing microparticles, four methods are explored and compared: sacrificial NaCl layer, gold (Au) layer, buffered oxide etching, and direct ultrasonic agitation. The primary film material studied in this work is amorphous silicon (Si). Physical morphology of the microparticles is examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Methods employed to characterize optical activity of the microparticles include: polarimetry, spectrophotometry, and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The produced chiral microparticles exhibit optical activity: optical rotation (OR) and circular dichroism (CD - in the form of differential circular transmission (DCT)). Significant findings include: (a) we observe the largest optical rotatory power ever reported in scientific literature, 11◦/μm at 610 nm wavelength for a Si film; (b) for the helical thin films, there is one dominant DCT band in the measured wavelength range; however for microparticle suspensions and powders, there exist two DCT bands: one broad band at long wavelengths, and one narrow band in the short wavelength range; compared to their thin film forms, microparticle suspensions and powders have inverted sign for the broad DCT band. A discrete dipole approximation (DDA) model is employed to calculate optical response (e.g. extinction, scattering, and absorption cross-sections) of the microparticles, so as to enable us to understand the effects of different structural parameters of the microparticles on their optical response. Calculation confirms that optical activity of chiral microparticles is due to coherent light scatterings with the chiral structures of the particles. The inversion in sign of the broad DCT bands of microparticle suspensions and powders is likely due to the averaging effect from random orientation of the helical microparticles, as is indicated both from experimental results and from calculation. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2012-07-06 09:59:20.751</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Studies of Small Aromatic Molecules on Semiconductor Surfaces</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Weymouth, Alfred John</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Understanding the behaviour of molecules on a semiconductor surface is necessary if molecular self-assembly is going to be employed, with existing semiconductor technology, to create useful devices. Si(111)-7x7 is an invaluable surface upon which to study molecular adsorption. The surface reconstruction has been well characterized and it possesses seven symmetrically distinct dangling bonds that can serve as reaction sites. Aromatic molecules on Si(111)-7x7 have been investigated with a variety of techniques and have been shown to chemisorb at room temperature. However, it is not trivial to predict how an ensemble of aromatic molecules might distribute themselves amongst the available bonding sites on this surface. The work presented in this thesis begins with a joint STM and ab initio investigation of thiophene on 7x7 that demonstrates kinetics are necessary to describe the chemisorption sites occupied at various coverages. A kinetic Monte Carlo model, taking into account a mobile physisorbed state, is shown to accurately describe this site occupancy at room temperature. This model disregards molecule-molecule interaction because thiophene does not sterically hinder chemisorption to a neighbouring dangling bond. A larger molecule, mesitylene, was then studied on Si(111)-7x7, and shown to form an ordered molecular lattice on the Si(111)-7x7 surface. This is the first demonstration of a porous molecular lattice grown on Si(111)-7x7 at room temperature. Finally, molecular chemisorption on the related 5x5 reconstruction, grown by depositing Ge on 7x7, is studied. It is found that the presence of Ge hinders molecular chemisorption, preventing formation of the mesitylene lattice. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-11 10:14:10.118</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Effects of Multi-exciton Interactions on Optical Cavity Emission</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Qi, XIAODONG</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents a theoretical study of the collective effects of a large number of photon emitters coupled to optical cavities. The ensemble effects are accounted for by considering both the light emitting and scattering by the photon emitters. It suggests that, to correctly estimate the emitters ensemble coupled cavity mode, it is necessary to consider the existence of the excited excitons ensemble and optical pumps. This thesis shows that optical pumps can excite more excitons and scattering channels as pumping power increases. The change in exciton population can lead to comprehensive spectral behaviors by changing the cavity spectral shapes, bandwidth and resonance positions, through the inhomogeneous broadening and frequencies repulsion effects of collective emissions. The existence of the exciton ensemble can also enhance optical coupling effects between target excitons and the cavity mode. The target exciton, which has a relatively large coupling strength and is close to the cavity peak, can affect the properties of the background dipoles and their coupling to the cavity. All these collective effects are sensitive to the number, the resonances distribution, and the optical properties of the background excitons in the frequency domain and the property of the target exciton, if any. This study provides a perspective on the control of the optical properties of cavities and individual excitons through collective excitation. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2012-07-30 14:51:15.914</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Alpha backgrounds in the DEAP dark matter search experiment.</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pollmann, TINA</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>One of the pressing concerns in Dark Matter detection experiments is ensuring that the potential signal from exceedingly rare Dark Matter interactions is not obscured by background from interactions with more common particles. This work focuses on the ways in which alpha particles from primordial isotopes in the DEAP detector components can cause background events in the region of interest for Dark Matter search, based on both Monte Carlo simulations and data from the DEAP-1 prototype detector. The DEAP experiment uses liquid argon as a target for Dark Matter interactions and relies on the organic electroluminescent dye tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) to shift the UV argon scintillation light to the visible range. The light yield and pulse shape of alpha particle induced scintillation of TPB, which is an essential input parameter for the simulations, was experimentally determined. An initial mismatch between simulated and measured background spectra could be explained by a model of geometric background events, which was experimentally confirmed and informed the design of certain parts of the DEAP-3600 detector that is under construction at the moment. Modification of the DEAP-1 detector geometry based on this model led to improved background rates. The remaining background was well described by the simulated spectra, and competitive limits on the contamination of acrylic with primordial isotopes were obtained. Purity requirements for the DEAP-3600 detector components were based on this work. The design and testing of a novel large area TPB deposition source, which will be used to make TPB coatings for the DEAP-3600 detector, is described. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2012-08-09 13:12:52.26</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Rayleigh ratio measurement for SNO+ liquid scintillator and background studies of the internal ropes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Asahi, SATOKO</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>As a successor of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, the SNO+ experiment is planned to start data taking in early 2013. Making use of the liquid scintillator, Linear Alkylbenzene (LAB), the SNO+ experiment aims to perform ux measurements of low energy solar neutrinos in one phase, and wait for neutrinoless double beta decay events in another phase where 44 kg of natural Neodymium would be added into LAB. The Rayleigh ratio of LAB was found to be 16.60 _ 3.14 _10 6 cm 1 at 546 nm using the relative measurement technique. The wavelength dependency of the Rayleigh scattering was also examined and compared with the theoretical prediction. A setup which is usable to measure the angular dependency of the Rayleigh scattering was built, and an isotropic behaviour of the scattering was tested. The _ and backgrounds, due to the internal calibration ropes situated in the scintillator volume, were studied using the SNO+ Monte Carlo Package. Also, the amount of 210Pb originating from the internal calibration ropes due to the intrinsic contamination of 238U, Rn emanation and plated on the surface prior to the installation were assessed to examine if it is a tolerable level to achieve the target level of 13.4 background events per day. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2012-08-31 15:56:59.875</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Instability of Periodic Orbits of Some Rhombus and Parallelogram Four Body Problems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mansur, ABDALLA</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The rhombus and parallelogram orbits are interesting families of periodic solutions, which come from celestial mechanics and the N-body problem. Variational methods with finite order symmetry group are used to construct minimizing non-collision periodic orbits. We study the question of stability or instability of periodic and symmetric periodic solutions of the rhombus and the equal mass parallelogram four body problems. We first study the stability of periodic solutions for the rhombus four body problem. An analytical description of the variational principle is used to show that the homographic solutions are the minimizers of the action functional restricted to rhombus loop space [23]. We employ techniques from symplectic geometry and specifically a variant of the Maslov index for curves of Lagrangian subspaces along the minimizing rhombus orbit to prove the main result, Theorem 4.2.2, which states that the reduced rhombus orbit is hyperbolic in the reduced energy manifold when it is not degenerate. We second study the stability for symmetric periodic solutions of the equal mass parallelogram four body problem. The parallelogram family is a family of Z_2× Z_4 symmetric action minimizing solutions, investigated by [7]. In this example, the minimizing solution [7] can be extended to a 4T-periodic solution using symmetries through square and collinear configurations. The Maslov index of the orbits is used to prove the main result, Theorem 5.3.1, which states that the minimizing equal mass parallelogram solution is unstable when it is non-degenerate. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2012-11-26 11:30:29.688</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Age-dependent effect of environmental light on spectral sensitivity and body colouration of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hornsby, Mark</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Signal reception and production form the basis of animal communication, and are largely constrained by environmental biophysical factors such as environmental light. However, the role of environmental light in producing variation in either signal reception or production has not been fully investigated. Using two distinct environmental light treatments, as well as a third treatment for a sampling of adults, I recorded corneal electroretinograms, lens transmission, and spectral reflectance of the body pattern of juvenile and adult Nile tilapia to chart the effect of environmental light on visual sensitivity and body colouration throughout ontogeny. Environmental light had an age-dependent effect on spectral sensitivity and an age-independent effect on spectral reflectance. Spectral sensitivity in juveniles reared under a broad-spectrum light treatment and a red-shifted light treatment differed mostly at short wavelengths, where the irradiance of the two environmental light treatments differed the most. In contrast, adults reared under the two environmental light treatments did not differ in spectral sensitivity. Lens transmission did not differ significantly between environmental light treatments, indicating that differences in spectral sensitivity of juveniles originated in the retina. Both juveniles and adults reared under the two environmental light treatments differed in spectral reflectance, and adults transferred to the third environmental light treatment differed in spectral reflectance from their counterparts reared under the two original treatments. These results demonstrate that environmental light plays a large role in shaping signal reception in juveniles and signal production throughout ontogeny, suggesting that environmental light has the capacity to drive ecological speciation. ; Thesis (Master, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2012-12-03 11:32:59.441</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Obstructions to Motion Planning by the Continuation Method</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Amiss, David Scott Cameron</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The subject of this thesis is the motion planning algorithm known as the continuation method. To solve motion planning problems, the continuation method proceeds by lifting curves in state space to curves in control space; the lifted curves are the solutions of special initial value problems called path-lifting equations. To validate this procedure, three distinct obstructions must be overcome. The first obstruction is that the endpoint maps of the control system under study must be twice continuously differentiable. By extending a result of A. Margheri, we show that this differentiability property is satisfied by an inclusive class of time-varying fully nonlinear control systems. The second obstruction is the existence of singular controls, which are simply the singular points of a fixed endpoint map. Rather than attempting to completely characterize such controls, we demonstrate how to isolate control systems for which no controls are singular. To this end, we build on the work of S. A. Vakhrameev to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition. In particular, this result accommodates time-varying fully nonlinear control systems. The final obstruction is that the solutions of path-lifting equations may not exist globally. To study this problem, we work under the standing assumption that the control system under study is control-affine. By extending a result of Y. Chitour, we show that the question of global existence can be resolved by examining Lie bracket configurations and momentum functions. Finally, we show that if the control system under study is completely unobstructed with respect to a fixed motion planning problem, then its corresponding endpoint map is a fiber bundle. In this sense, we obtain a necessary condition for unobstructed motion planning by the continuation method. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2012-12-18 20:53:43.272</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fibre-Loop Ring-Down Spectroscopy Using Liquid Core Waveguides</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bescherer-Nachtmann, Klaus</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Cavity ring-down spectroscopy has been used over the last twenty years as a highly sensitive absorption spectroscopic technique to measure light attenuation in gases, liquids, and solid samples. An optical cavity is used as a multi-pass cell, and the decay time of the light intensity in the cavity is measured, thereby rendering the techniques insensitive to light intensity fluctuations. Optical waveguides are used to build the optical cavities presented in this work. The geometries of such waveguides permit the use of very small liquid sample volumes while retaining the advantages of cavity ring-down spectroscopy. In this thesis cavity ring-down measurements are conducted, both, in the time domain and by measuring phase-shifts of sinusoidally modulated light, and the two methods are theoretically connected using a simple mathematical model, which is then experimentally confirmed. A new laser driver, that is compatible with high powered diode lasers, has to be designed to be able to switch from time domain to frequency domain measurements. A sample path length enhancement within the optical cavity is explored with the use of liquid core waveguides. The setup was optimised with respect to the matrix liquid, the geometrical matching of waveguide geometries, and the shape of liquid core waveguide ends. Additionally, a new technique of producing concave lenses at fibre ends has been developed and the output of a general fibre lens is simulated. Finally, liquid core waveguides are incorporated into a fibre-loop ring-down spectroscopy setup to measure the attenuation of two model dyes in a sample volume of &lt;1 µL. The setup is characterized by measuring concentrations of Allura Red AC and Congo Red from 1 µM to a limit of detection of 5 nM. The performance of the setup is compared to other absorption techniques measuring liquid samples. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-23 14:08:16.33</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dissipative dynamics of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates at zero temperature</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wu, ZHIGANG</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis we study various dissipative processes that are associated with the flow of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. In particular, we investigate the effect of a weak correlated disorder potential on the collective dipole motion of a harmonically-confined elongated condensate. By using an extension of the Harmonic Potential Theorem, we demonstrate that the dynamics of the system can be described equivalently in terms of a disorder potential oscillating relative to a stationary condensate. This latter point of view allows the application of linear response theory to determine the drag force experienced by the condensate and to evaluate the damping rate of the centre of mass oscillation. The density response function for the elongated condensate is determined with a new local density approximation that takes into account the tight radial confinement of the atomic cloud. Our linear response theory reveals the detailed dependence of the damping rate on various system parameters. A comparison with available experimental data is only partially successful and points to the need for additional experiments. In addition to disorder induced dissipation, we also consider a variety of other problems that can be addressed by means of linear response theory. For example, we study momentum transferred to a condensate by a Bragg pulse and the energy absorption of a gas in an optical lattice that is parametrically modulated in different ways. All of these applications demonstrate the utility of linear response theory in describing the dynamics of Bose-condensed systems which are subjected to weak perturbations. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-26 10:54:11.915</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Gigahertz Modulation of a Photonic Crystal Cavity</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ali, Aaron</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Photonic crystal (PtC) cavities are an increasingly important way to create all optical methods to control optical data. Not only must the data be controlled, but interfacing it with high frequency electrical signals is particularly interesting especially if this occurs in the 1.55µm telecom band. We present an experiment that uses Rayleigh surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to modulate the frequency of the guided mode of an L3-cavity PtC created on a silicon slab. This work has the potential to interface optical and electrical signals via a mechanical strain wave operating at gigahertz frequencies. Defects are carefully designed into a triangular lattice PtC to realize a waveguide coupled optical cavity. The cavity can be experimentally accessed through grating couplers excited by polarized light at 10 degrees incidence from normal. The optical components are fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator platform, with light confined to the silicon slab region. Through transmission experiments, the L3 cavity was found to have a narrow resonance characterized by a Lorentzian distribution. A quality factor of 165 centered at 6255 1/cm (1.599µm) was measured. Aluminum interdigitated transducers (IDTs) were fabricated through a lithography liftoff process. Their ability to create SAWs requires a piezoelectric medium. As silicon does not have this property, growth of a thin ZnO film was required. The transducers were measured using a network analyzer and were found to produce Rayleigh SAWs at a frequency of 179MHz and a wavelength of 24µm. The acoustic energy traveled 70µm to the target optical device. The L3 cavity has dimensions of around 4µm a side - less than 1/2 a SAW wavelength. Modulation of the L3 PtC resonant frequency was monitored through a repeat of the transmission experiment but with RF excitation of the IDTs at the SAW frequency. A broadening of the transmission spectrum was expected. Unfortunately no change in the fitting parameters could be measured. An HF etch was used to undercut the L3 PtC such that a silicon slab suspended in air could be realized. Simulations had been conducted showing an order of magnitude increase in the quality factor was possible. Broken wirebonds on the transducers created unintended etch channels rendering the SAW non-operational. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-29 12:33:49.254</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Low Energy 8B Solar Neutrinos in SNO+: Controlling and Constraining Radon Backgrounds</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Seddighin, MARYAM</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>SNOLAB located in Sudbury, Canada, is hosting a new liquid scintillator experiment for studying neutrinos which is called SNO+. Many interesting physics topics such as measuring low energy solar neutrinos and searching for neutrinoless double beta decay are expected to be performed using the SNO+ detector. SNO+ is designed to measure the solar neutrino flux at a lower energy range than SNO, and therefore it is able to study LMA-MSW oscillations at this range of energy. This research is concerned with extracting low energy 8B solar neutrinos while studying the tagging and reduction of 214Bi by 99.8%, one of the main backgrounds in the energy range of interest. Ways to measure and control radon were also studied since it is the source of the 214Bi background. Scintillation material, zinc sulfide, was selected for use in fabrication of radon detectors known as Lucas cells. The fabrication of cover gas bags employed in the SNO+ experiment to react to mine air pressure fluctuations is described and the interior radon emanation of these bags was measured and calculated. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2013-05-01 20:26:56.981</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Large-eddy simulation of unidirectional turbulent flow over dunes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Omidyeganeh, MOHAMMAD</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We performed large eddy simulation of the flow over a series of two- and three-dimensional dune geometries at laboratory scale using the Lagrangian dynamic eddy-viscosity subgrid-scale model. First, we studied the flow over a standard 2D transverse dune geometry, then bedform three-dimensionality was imposed. Finally, we investigated the turbulent flow over barchan dunes. The results are validated by comparison with simulations and experiments for the 2D dune case, while the results of the 3D dunes are validated qualitatively against experiments. The flow over transverse dunes separates at the dune crest, generating a shear layer that plays a crucial role in the transport of momentum and energy, as well as the generation of coherent structures. Spanwise vortices are generated in the separated shear; as they are advected, they undergo lateral instabilities and develop into horseshoe-like structures and finally reach the surface. The ejection that occurs between the legs of the vortex creates the upwelling and downdrafting events on the free surface known as “boils”. The three-dimensional separation of flow at the crestline alters the distribution of wall pressure, which may cause secondary flow across the stream. The mean flow is characterized by a pair of counter-rotating streamwise vortices, with core radii of the order of the flow depth. Staggering the crestlines alters the secondary motion; two pairs of streamwise vortices appear (a strong one, centred about the lobe, and a weaker one, coming from the previous dune, centred around the saddle). The flow over barchan dunes presents significant differences to that over transverse dunes. The flow near the bed, upstream of the dune, diverges from the centerline plane; the flow close to the centerline plane separates at the crest and reattaches on the bed. Away from the centerline plane and along the horns, flow separation occurs intermittently. The flow in the separation bubble is routed towards the horns and leaves the dune at the tips. Barchan dunes induce two counter-rotating streamwise vortices, along each of the horns, which direct high-momentum fluid toward the symmetry plane and low-momentum fluid near the bed away from the centerline. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-05-27 18:58:48.969</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Scanning Photocurrent and Photoluminescence Imaging of Frozen Polymer Light Emitting Electrochemical Cells</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Inayeh, Alex</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A polymer light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) is a solid-state polymer device operating according to in situ electrochemical doping and the formation of a light-emitting polymer p-n junction. This operating mechanism, however, has been the subject of much debate. Planar LECs with millimeter scale interelectrode spacings offer great advantages for directly observing the electrochemical doping process. Photoluminescence quenching and the formation of a light-emitting junction have been observed in planar polymer LECs, demonstrating the existence of electrochemical doping. The chemical potential difference between the p- and n-doped regions creates a built-in potential/electric field in the junction region, which can be probed by measuring the optical beam induced current (OBIC). This study utilizes a versatile and easy-to-use method of performing OBIC analysis. The OBIC and photoluminescence profiles of LECs have been simultaneously measured by scanning a focused light beam across large planar LECs that have been turned on and cooled to freeze the doping profile. The photoluminescence intensity undergoes a sharp transition between the p- and n-doped regions. The OBIC photocurrent is only observed in the transition region that is narrower than the width of the excitation beam, which is about 35 μm. The results depict a static planar polymer p-n junction with a built-in electric field pointing from n to p. The electrode interfaces do not produce a measurable photocurrent indicating ohmic contact. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2013-05-28 12:52:14.171</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Combustion Wave Propagation Regimes in a Channel equipped with an Array of Cross-flow Cylindrical Obstacles</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pinos, THOMAS</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Flame propagation through a channel equipped with obstacles was studied experimentally. Two types of obstacle geometries were investigated, i.e., wall-mounted cross-flow cylinders and fence-type obstacles mounted on the top and bottom channel surfaces. The motivation for this research is its applications to both high-speed propulsion and industrial explosion safety. The effect of obstacle distribution and blockage ratio on flame acceleration was investigated in a 2.54cm x 7.6cm “narrow” channel with wall-mounted cross-flow cylindrical obstacles. The cylinders were arranged in a “staggered” or “inline” pattern, with blockage ratios of 0.5 and 0.67. Schlieren images were used to study the flame shape and its leading edge velocity for a range of fuel-air mixtures compositions. It was determined that initial flame propagation occurs faster in higher blockage ratios due to the higher frequency perturbation to the flow. Flame acceleration led to different quasi-steady flame and detonation propagation regimes. In general, higher final steady flame velocities were reached in the lower blockage ratios, and detonation limits were found to be influenced by the geometry. The influence of channel width on flame acceleration was also determined using fence-type obstacles with a single blockage ratio. Experiments were performed in a 2.54cm x 7.6cm and 7.6cm x 7.6cm channel. Schlieren images were again used to study the flame shape and to obtain leading edge velocity. The flame tip was found to have a parabolic profile across the channel width for the narrower channel and flatter profile in the wider channel. It was determined that the channel width has a weak effect on the flame velocity down the channel length. As such, flame acceleration was initially only slightly more pronounced in the narrow channel before the reverse became true later in the wide channel. ; Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-07-18 21:13:40.436</dc:description>

          <dc:title>TUNABLE AND HIGH REFRACTIVE INDEX POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE POLYMERS FOR LABEL-FREE OPTICAL SENSING</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Little, JESSAMYN</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>There is a need for chemical sensors for monitoring volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air. Acute and chronic inhalation of toxic VOCs can cause adverse health effects in humans, so monitoring these analytes is important for ensuring that their concentrations are maintained below maximum permissible levels. Chemical sensors using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to extract VOCs with partial selectivity, coupled with label-free optical detection methods based on refractive index, can overcome the limitations of conventional VOC detection methods. A variety of tunable and high refractive index PDMS materials were developed by incorporating a range of titanium and zirconium concentrations (2.5 – 30 mol % and 2.5 – 15 mol %, respectively) using a simple sol-gel synthesis and by incorporating a range of titanium concentrations (2.5 – 10 mol %) into naphthyl-functionalized PDMS. These materials ranged in refractive index from 1.4023 ± 0.0002 to 1.5663 ± 0.0001 at 635 nm and 1.3942 ± 0.0003 to 1.5510 ± 0.0007 at 1550 nm. The ability to use tunable refractive index PDMS films to differentiate between m-xylene and cyclohexane was demonstrated by monitoring changes in refractive index and thickness following absorption of these analytes using a refractometer at 1550 nm. The sensitivity of the refractive index response to an analyte using a particular PDMS film was dependent upon the difference between the refractive index of the analyte and film, as well as the film-air partition coefficient of the analyte. The detection limits for m-xylene and cyclohexane were 81 ppm and 4940 ppm, respectively, using PDMS-titanium-oxo nanocomposites with 5 and 10 mol % Ti, respectively. A simple planar waveguide sensor with an input grating coupler was developed to monitor changes in refractive index of the cladding through shifts in peak resonance wavelength. Using high refractive index PDMS materials as the waveguide core, we monitored changes in refractive index arising from absorption of VOCs into the grating. Here, the sensitivity of the waveguide response was dependent upon the difference in refractive index of the analyte and polymer, as well as the film-air partition coefficient of the analyte. The detection limits for m-xylene and cyclohexane were 1980 ppm and 18000 ppm, respectively. ; Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2013-08-24 11:45:57.642</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Chen, Shyh-Chi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Mammalians process their photoreceptions through lateral eyes; however, non-mammalian vertebrates and invertebrates possess additional extraretinal photoreceptors over their bodies to detect light stimuli. Chromatophores, i.e. dermal specialized pigment cells, play important roles in the regulation of body patterns. Since chromatophores derive from neural crest, they share the common embryonic origin with retina. Recent evidence shows that they are light-sensitive due to opsin expression. In the present study, the expression of seven cone opsins was detected in tilapia caudal fin tissues. Moreover, distinct photoresponses were found in two chromatophore types. Regardless of stimulating wavelengths, melanophores tend to disperse and maintain cell shape at dispersion stage by shuttling pigment granules. Conversely, erythrophores respond to light in a wavelength-dependent manner. The opsin expression profiles of melanophores and erythrophores imply SWS1 and RH2 group genes may play important roles in chromatophore photoresponses. Through measuring photosensitivity, I suggest the two opsins play opposite roles in light-induced translocations of pigment granules within erythrophores: SWS1 for aggregations at UV and short wavelength regions and RH2b for dispersion in middle/long wavelengths. An antagonistic interaction occurs in the overlapping of the absorbance spectra of the two opsins. I also found that the photoresponses take place along with the occurrence of the change of cell membrane potential. In addition, the effect of different light backgrounds (broad spectrum, short wavelength-rich, and red-shifted light conditions) on the photosensitivity of tilapia erythrophores was investigated. I found that the major opsin classes (SWS1 and RH2b) responsible for photoresponses remain constant in three groups of erythrophores. Together, I postulate that melanophores may serve as a light filter in integumentary tissues, and the chromatically antagonistic mechanism enables tilapia erythrophores to sense the subtle change of environmental photic condition and to fine-tune pigmentation. I also investigated the ontogenetic change of photoresponses of rainbow trout melanophores. Distinct photoresponses were found in parrs and smolts. Furthermore, smolt melanophores responded to light in a wavelength-dependent manner. Since the change of coloration and visual system during smoltification of salmonids is regulated by thyroid hormone (TH), I suggest that the development of melanophore photosensitivity is associated to TH as well. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2013-08-27 09:57:22.907</dc:description>

          <dc:title>SIZE, DYNAMICS AND CONSEQUENCES OF LARGE-SCALE HORIZONTAL COHERENT STRUCTURES IN OPEN-CHANNEL FLOWS: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ahmari, Habib</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis concerns the occurrence of the large-scale bed and plan forms known as alternate bars and meandering, and the internal structures of the flow associated with their formation. The work is to be viewed as an extension of previous work by da Silva (1991), Yalin (1992), and Yalin and da Silva (2001). As a first step in this work, the criteria for occurrence of alternate bars and meandering of Yalin and da Silva (2001) is re-considered in view of additional field and laboratory data from the recent literature and data resulting from two series of experimental runs carried out in two sediment transport flumes. This leads to a number of modifications of the boundary-lines in the related existence-region diagram of Yalin and da Silva. The size of the largest horizontal coherent structures (HCS’s) of an alternate bar inducing flow was then investigated experimentally on the basis of three series of flow velocity measurements. These were carried out in a 21m-long, 1m-wide straight channel, conveying a 4cm-deep flow. The bed consisted of a silica sand having a grain size of 2mm; its surface was flat. The measurements were carried out using a Sontek 2D Micro ADV. The horizontal burst length was found to be between five and seven times the flow width. The effect of the HCS’s on the mean flow was also investigated. A slight internal meandering of the flow caused by the superimposition of burst-sequences on the mean flow was clearly detectable. Finally, with the aid of three new series of measurements in the same channel, an attempt was made to penetrate the dynamics and life-cycle of the HCS’s. For this purpose, quadrant analysis was used; the cross-sectional distribution of relevant statistical turbulence-related parameters was investigated; and cross-correlations of flow velocity along the flow depth and across the channel were performed. The analysis indicates that the HCS’s originate near the channel banks, with the location of ejections and sweeps being anti-symmetrically arranged with regard to the channel centreline, and then evolve so as to occupy the entire depth of the water and the entire width of the channel. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2010-03-09 10:20:53.596</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In this thesis we investigate the existence and stability of periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems with a discrete symmetry. The global existence of periodic motions can be proven using the classical techniques of the calculus of variations; our particular interest is in how the stability type of the solutions thus obtained can be determined analytically using solely the variational problem and the symmetries of the system -- we make no use of numerical or perturbation techniques. Instead, we use a method introduced in [41] in the context of a special case of the three-body problem. Using techniques from symplectic geometry, and specifically the Maslov index for curves of Lagrangian subspaces along the minimizing trajectories, we verify conditions which preclude the existence of eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix on the unit circle. We study the applicability of this method in two specific cases. Firstly, we consider another special case from celestial mechanics: the hip-hop solutions of the 2N-body problem. This is a family of Z_2-symmetric, periodic orbits which arise as collision-free minimizers of the Lagrangian action on a space of symmetric loops [14, 53]. Following a symplectic reduction, it is shown that the hip-hop solutions are brake orbits which are generically hyperbolic on the reduced energy-momentum surface. Secondly we consider a class of natural Hamiltonian systems of two degrees of freedom with a homogeneous potential function. The associated action functional is unbounded above and below on the function space of symmetric curves, but saddle points can be located by minimization subject to a certain natural constraint of a type first considered by Nehari [37, 38]. Using the direct method of the calculus of variations, we prove the existence of symmetric solutions of both prescribed period and prescribed energy. In the latter case, we employ a variational principle of van Groesen [55] based upon a modification of the Jacobi functional, which has not been widely used in the literature. We then demonstrate that the (constrained) minimizers are again hyperbolic brake orbits; this is the first time the method has been applied to solutions which are not globally minimizing. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-25 10:47:53.257</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Modelling Laser Light Propagation in Thermoplastics Using Monte Carlo Simulations</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Parkinson, Alexander</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Laser welding has great potential as a fast, non-contact joining method for thermoplastic parts. In the laser transmission welding of thermoplastics, light passes through a semi-transparent part to reach the weld interface. There, it is absorbed as heat, which causes melting and subsequent welding. The distribution and quantity of light reaching the interface are important for predicting the quality of a weld, but are experimentally difficult to estimate. A model for simulating the path of this laser light through these light-scattering plastic parts has been developed. The technique uses a Monte-Carlo approach to generate photon paths through the material, accounting for absorption, scattering and reflection between boundaries in the transparent polymer. It was assumed that any light escaping the bottom surface contributed to welding. The photon paths are then scaled according to the input beam profile in order to simulate non-Gaussian beam profiles. A method for determining the 3 independent optical parameters to accurately predict transmission and beam power distribution at the interface was established using experimental data for polycarbonate at 4 different glass fibre concentrations and polyamide-6 reinforced with 20% long glass fibres. Exit beam profiles and transmissions predicted by the simulation were found to be in generally good agreement (R2&gt;0.90) with experimental measurements. The simulations allowed the prediction of transmission and power distributions at other thicknesses as well as information on reflection, energy absorption and power distributions at other thicknesses for these materials. ; Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-27 10:41:08.997</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantum Optics and the Quantum Jump Technique for Lossy and Non-Orthogonal Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Doutre, Sean</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis I develop a formalism for analyzing quantum optics in photonic crystal slab cavities which may be coupled, lossy, and non-orthogonal. Using a tight-binding approximation I find classical coupled-cavity quasimodes which overlap in space and frequency. These classical modes are used to develop a multiphoton basis for quantum optics with non-orthogonal photon states. I develop creation and annihilation operators with a novel commutation relation as a consequence of the nonorthogonality of the quasimodes. With these operators the effective Hamiltonian, number operator, electric field operator and quadrature operators are obtained. The quantum jump technique is applied to handle the effects of loss. This technique is compared with the master equation, and conditions for the quantum jump technique being preferable are described. The quantum jump technique is implemented numerically, allowing for time-dependent linear and X(2) non-linear pumping. I use a combination of analytic results and characteristic functions to examine the evolution of coherent and squeezed states in a single lossy quasimode. The analysis is then extended to two nonorthogonal quasimodes. States are investigated using reduced characteristic functions. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-27 12:00:10.281</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Second Harmonic Generation of Chiral-Modified Silver Nanoparticles</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tao, Yue</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Chiral molecules, which exist under enantiomers with non-mirror-symmetrical structures, have been the subject of intense research for their linear and nonlinear optical activities. Cysteine is such a chiral amino acid found as a building block of proteins throughout human bodies. Second harmonic generation (SHG) has been considered to investigate chiral molecules. SHG from metallic nanoparticles is promising for nanoplasmonics and photonic nanodevice applications. Therefore, it’s desirable to combine and study nonlinear properties due to both chirality and metallic nanoparticles, and help developing an alternatively optical diagnostic of chiral molecules. Our experiments are carried out with the FemtoFiber Scientific FFS laser system. SHG of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) modified by either L-Cysteine (L-C) or D-Cysteine (D-C) is observed, where L-Cysteine and D-Cysteine are a pair of enantiomers. Ag NPs are deposited through Vacuum Thermal Evaporation, controlled under different deposition thicknesses. UV-Vis/IR spectra and AFM are used to characterize Ag NPs under different conditions. Transmitted SHG measurements dependent on incidence are recorded with standard lock-in techniques. Deposition thickness of vacuum thermal evaporation plays an important role in forming diverse Ag NPs, which strongly imparts the intensity of SHG. Second harmonic intensity as a function of the incident angle presents similar results for Ag NPs with or without L-Cysteine or D-Cysteine modification, in the output of p- and s-polarization. However, we monitor reversed rotation difference in second harmonic intensities at linearly +45° and -45° polarization for L-C/Ag NPs and D-C/Ag NPs, while there’s no difference at linearly +45° and -45° polarization for Ag NPs alone. This optical rotation difference in SHG is termed as SHG-ORD. Also, for second harmonic light fixed at p-polarization, L-C/Ag NPs and D-C/Ag NPs exhibit a reversely net difference for SHG excited by right and left circular polarization, which is termed as SHG-CD. Experiments on SHG-ORD of chiral-modified Ag NPs by a mixture of L-Cysteine and D-Cysteine further help verifying the existence of chirality in chiral-modified Ag NPs. As a conclusion, SHG efficiently probed and distinguished L-Cysteine from D-Cysteine in chiral-modified Ag NPs. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-29 21:27:23.112</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Planar Leaky-Wave Antennas and Microwave Circuits by Practical Surface Wave Launching</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Podilchak, SYMON</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Modern communication systems have increased the need for creative antenna solutions and low-profile circuit configurations that can offer high-quality performance at a low cost. The microwave and millimeter-wave frequency ranges have shown much promise allowing for increased data transmission rates while also offering smaller and compact designs. Specific applications for these wireless systems include radar, biomedical sensors, phased arrays, and communication devices. Planar antennas and circuits are generally well adopted for these applications due to their low profile and ease of fabrication. However, classic feeding techniques for planar structures can be problematic. Losses can also be observed in these conventional feeding schemes due to unwanted surface wave (SW) excitation. This can lead to reduced antenna and circuit efficiencies, and thus, diminished system performance. It is shown in this thesis that by the use of planar SW sources, or surface-wave launchers (SWLs), innovative and efficient antennas and feed systems are possible. Theoretical analysis and experimental verification for these SWLs are initially presented. New topologies and array configurations are also examined for directive beam steering at end-fire and at broadside. Additionally, studied structures include novel surface-wave antennas (SWAs) and leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) for 3-D beam pattern control in the far-field. A comprehensive design strategy is also examined which describes the implementation of these planar antennas using SWLs. This design strategy is based on a full-wave analysis of the modes that can be supported by the planar structures which include various planar-periodic metallic strip configurations and partially reflecting surfaces (PRSs) or screens. With appropriate conditions SWs can also be bound and guided for field channeling and power routing. For instance, novel planar metallic SW lenses and guidance structures are developed. Demonstrated applications include couplers, transition sections, as well as new planar circuits for power dividing/combining. To the author's knowledge, similar techniques have not been previously studied in the literature which allow for such controlled SW propagation and radiation. This way, SWs, which are normally considered an unwanted effect are used here to advantage. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-30 08:29:04.107</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Computational Fluid Dynamics Modelling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Nishida, Robert Takeo</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Two computational fluid dynamics models are developed to predict the performance of a solid oxide fuel cell stack, a detailed and a simplified model. In the detailed model, the three dimensional momentum, heat, and species transport equations are coupled with electrochemistry. In the simplified model, the diffusion terms in the transport equations are selectively replaced by rate terms within the core region of the stack. This allows much coarser meshes to be employed at a fraction of the computational cost. Following the mathematical description of the problem, results for single-cell and multi-cell stacks are presented. Comparisons of local current density, temperature, and cell voltage indicate that good agreement is obtained between the detailed and simplified models, verifying the latter as a practical option in stack design. Then, the simplified model is used to determine the effects of utilization on the electrochemical performance and temperature distributions of a 10 cell stack. The results are presented in terms of fluid flow, pressure, species mass fraction, temperature, voltage and current density distributions. The effects of species and flow distributions on electrochemical performance and temperature are then analyzed for a 100 cell stack. The discussion highlights the importance of manifold design on performance and thermal management of large stacks. ; Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-30 15:55:18.627</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Modified Detector Concept for SuperCDMS: The HiZIP and Its Charge Performance</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Page, Kedar Mohan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>SuperCDMS is a leading direct dark matter search experiment which uses solid state detectors (Ge crystals) at milliKelvin temperatures to look for nuclear recoils caused by dark matter interactions in the detector. ‘Weakly Interacting Massive Particles’ (WIMPs) are the most favoured dark matter candidate particles. SuperCDMS, like many other direct dark matter search experiments, primarily looks for WIMPs. The measurement of both the ionization and the lattice vibration (phonon) signals from an interaction in the detector allow it to discriminate against electron recoils which are the main source of background for WIMP detection. SuperCDMS currently operates about 9 kgs worth of germanium detectors at the Soudan underground lab in northern Minnesota. In its next phase, SuperCDMS SNOLAB, it plans to use 100-200 kg of target mass (Ge) which would allow it to probe more of the interesting and unexplored parameter space for WIMPs predicted by theoretical models. The SuperCDMS Queen’s Test Facility is a detector testing facility which is intended to serve detector testing and detector research and development purposes for the SuperCDMS experiment. A modified detector called the ‘HiZIP’ (Half-iZIP), which is reduced in complexity in comparison to the currently used iZIP (interleaved Z-sensitive Ionization and Phonon mediated) detectors, is studied in this thesis. The HiZIP detector design also serves to discriminate against background from multiple scatter events occurring close to the surfaces in a single detector. Studies carried out to compare the surface event leakage in the HiZIP detector using limited information from iZIP data taken at SuperCDMS test facility at UC Berkley produce a highly conservative upper limit of 5 out of 10,000 events at 90% confidence level. This upper limit is the best among many different HiZIP configurations that were investigated and is comparable to the upper limit calculated for an iZIP detector in the same way using the same data. A real HiZIP device operated at Queen’s Test Facility produced an exposure limited 90% upper limit of about 1 in 100 events for surface event leakage. The data used in these studies contain true nuclear recoil events from cosmogenic and ambient neutrons. This background was not subtracted in the calculation of the upper limits stated above and hence they are highly conservative. A surface event source was produced by depositing lead-210 from radon exposure onto a copper plate. This source was then used to take data for a surface event discrimination study of the HiZIP detector operated at Queen’s Test Facility. A study of the contribution of the noise from capacitive crosstalk between charge sensors in a HiZIP detector configuration was investigated, confirming the expectation that no significant drop in performance is to be expected due to this effect. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-30 23:48:49.375</dc:description>

          <dc:title>STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF SELF-ASSEMBLED SUB-MICRON THIN NAFION® FILMS</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Paul, DEVPROSHAD</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis is concerned with the study of morphology and properties of sub-micron thin Nafion® films. The motivation of the work arises from the need to characterize the 4 -10 nm thin ionomer films in the catalyst layer of polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC). A protocol for the fabrication of self-assembled ultra-thin Nafion® films on planar substrates was successfully developed. Films of thickness ranging 4 nm-300 nm, determined by three different techniques - variable angle spectroscopy ellipsometry (VASE), atomic force microscope (AFM) and x-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS), could be reproducibly generated on SiO2/Si wafer. The 4 nm thin film is one of the thinnest, continuous film of Nafion® ever reported. This is the first time that the structure/properties of such thin Nafion® film have been investigated. An interesting finding is the thickness-dependent structure and property of these films. Films with thickness &lt;55 nm exhibited hydrophilic-free surface but thicker films (&gt;55 nm) had hydrophobic surface. Similarly, sub-55 nm films had a lower and thickness-independent protonic conductivity compared to thicker films that exhibited thickness-dependent conductivity. Anomalously high water uptake (by quartz crystal microbalance) and swelling (by ellipsometry) of sub-55nm films indicate that low conductivity is not due to low water content However, differences in surface morphology were observed by the AFM phase contrast analysis. The lack of ionic domain was also observed in the thinner films (4-30 nm) from the grazing incidence small x-ray scattering (GISAXS) experiments. Thermal annealing over a range of temperature (110-160 oC) revealed a dramatic switching of the film surface from hydrophilic to hydrophobic was observed for sub-55 nm films with lower thickness film requiring higher annealing temperature. Bulk proton conductivity was significantly reduced after annealing for all films. An interesting finding was the regeneration of conductivity after to prolonged liquid water exposure and a corresponding switching back of the surface to hydrophilic. The thickness-dependent structure/property of ultra-thin Nafion® films is attributed to substrate induced confinement effect. Self-assembly of Nafion® on various substrates (SiO2, carbon, Pt and Au) was studied. The ionomer/substrate interaction and resulting film morphology followed a trend with respect to substrate surface energies and Nafion® dispersion compositions. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-29 12:36:19.05</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An Investigation of Backgrounds in the DEAP-3600 Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiment</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Veloce, LAURELLE</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Astronomical and cosmological observations reveal that the majority of the matter in our universe is made of an unknown, non-luminous substance called dark matter. Many experimental attempts are underway to directly detect particle dark matter, which is very difficult to measure due to the expected low interaction rate with normal matter. DEAP-3600 is a direct dark matter search experiment located two kilometres underground at SNOLAB, in Sudbury, Ontario. DEAP-3600 will make use of liquid argon as the detector material, which scintillates as charged particles pass through. The work presented here is an investigation of expected background sources in the DEAP detector. Because DEAP-3600 is a noble liquid-based experiment, a thin film of [1,1,4,4]-tetraphenyl-[1,3]-butadiene (TPB) is coated on the detector walls to shift the scintillation peak from the UV to visible regime for detection. However, alphas passing through TPB produce scintillation signals which can mimic recoil events. Because scintillation properties can change with temperature, we have conducted an investigation of alpha-induced TPB scintillation at temperatures ranging from 300 K to 3.4 K. We were able to characterize the light yield and decay times, and demonstrated that these background events should be distinguishable from true recoil events in liquid argon, thus enabling DEAP-3600 to achieve higher dark matter sensitivity. Additionally, we investigate the performance of the liquid argon purification systems, specifically the activated charcoal used for radon filtration. Previous measurements with the DEAP prototype experiment have demonstrated the necessity of removing radon from the argon prior to filling the detector, due to the release of contaminates from the argon storage systems. Charcoal radon filters are extremely efficient, however, if the emanation rate of the charcoal is too high, there is the possibility of re-contamination. We performed a measurement of the radon emanation rate of a charcoal sample using a radon emanation and extraction system at Queens University. We demonstrated that the emanation rate of the charcoal was consistent with zero. We also show that the number of residual radon atoms which reach the detector would not be an issue for DEAP-3600. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2013-10-10 18:36:40.2</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Phononic Crystal Waveguiding in GaAs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Azodi Aval, Golnaz</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Compared to the much more common photonic crystals that are used to manipulate light, phononic crystals (PnCs) with inclusions in a lattice can be used to manipulate sound. While trying to propagate in a periodically structured media, acoustic waves may experience geometries in which propagation forward is totally forbidden. Furthermore, defects in the periodicity can be used to confine acoustic waves to follow complicated routes on a wavelength scale. Using advanced fabrication methods, we aim to implement these structures to control surface acoustic wave (SAW) propagation on the piezoelectric surface and eventually interact SAWs with quantum structures. To investigate the interaction of SAWs with periodic elastic structures, SAW interdigital transducers (IDTs) and PnC fabrication procedures were developed. GaAs is chosen as a piezoelectric substrate for SAWs propagation. Lift-off photolithography processes were used to fabricate IDTs with finger widths as low as 1.5 micron. PnCs are periodic structures of shallow air holes created in GaAs substrate by means of a wet-etching process. The PnCs are square lattices with lattice constants of 8 and 4 micron. To predict the behavior of a SAW when interacting with the PnC structures, an FDTD simulator was used to calculate the band structures and SAW wave displacement on the crystal surface. The bandgap (BG) predicted for the 8 micron crystal ranges from 180 MHz to 220 MHz. Simulations show a shift in the BG position for 4 micron crystals ranging from 391 to 439 MHz. Two main waveguide geometries were considered in this work: a simple line waveguide and a funneling entrance line waveguide. Simulations indicated an increase in acoustic power density for the funneling waveguides. Fabricated device evaluated with electrical measurements. In addition, a scanning Sagnac interferometer is used to map the energy density of the SAWs. The Sagnac interferometer is designed to measure the outward displacement of a surface due to the SAW. Interferometric measurements confirmed waveguiding in the modified funnel entrance waveguide embedded in the 4 micron PnC. However, they also revealed strong dissipation of the SAW in the waveguide due to the non-vertical sidewalls resulting from the wet-etch process. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2013-11-29 15:53:46.369</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Exciton relaxation dynamics in a one-dimensional semiconductor</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>XIAO, YEE-FANG</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Carbon nanotubes are intriguing materials and extensively studied for both their fundamental properties and extraordinary performance in various applications during the last 20 years. They are extremely small in diameter, light in weight, sensitive to the environment, strong, and chemically stable. They can be either metallic or semiconducting depending on their species. The semiconducting species can absorb and emit light in a wide range of wavelengths. These outstanding properties of carbon nanotubes promise abundant applications that may be revolutionary. The opto-electronic behaviour of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) is extremely sensitive to its physical structure and ambient environment. Structural defects and surrounding environment are extrinsic influential factors that often obscure the understanding of the intrinsic behaviour. Progress on SWCNT synthesis has been made continuously but not until the last 10 years, have single SWCNTs been isolated individually and from substrates so that their fluorescence can be detected. The fundamental science of an optically generated exciton (an electron-hole pair) in an ideal semiconducting SWCNT is not fully understood despite many studies of exciton behaviour using various optical approaches. The major challenge is controlling SWCNT sample qualities. SWCNT's fundamental properties, such as the absorption cross section, quantum efficiency, radiative and nonradiative lifetimes, remain under debate. Knowing the intrinsic SWCNT properties is essential to understand exciton transport and relaxation mechanisms. To minimize the extrinsic effects, we have selected high-quality unprocessed SWCNTs for investigation. Collaboration with Dr. P. Finnie and Dr. J. Lefebvre at National Research Council Canada, allow us to access pristine SWCNTs individually. Since the emission from a single SWCNT is low, it requires unconventional methods to measure the PL dynamics. Suggested by the results, exciton transport in a semiconducting SWCNT is diffusional at room temperature, with high diffusivity (130 -350 cm^2/s) and long diffusion length (1 - 5 µm). At lower temperatures, we observed a more efficient exciton-exciton interaction that suggests the contribution from hot excitons or a longer existence of delocalized excitons. Highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation and long coherence time in a SWCNT are promising for making a single-photon source at near-infrared wavelength range and developing quantum computers. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2013-12-06 09:52:51.136</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental and Numerical Investigations of Velocity and Turbulent Quantities of a Jet Diffusion Flame</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Piro, Markus Hans</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A turbulent diffusion flame that is typically used in a thermal spray coating system was analyzed in this study, as part of a diagnostic and development program undertaken by a research group at Queen’s University. Contributions made by this researcher were to numerically and experimentally investigate velocity and turbulent fields of the gaseous phase of the jet. Numerical and experimental analyses have been further developed upon previous research, with improved numerical methods and advanced experimental instrumentation. Numerous numerical simulations were performed in both two dimensional axisymmetric and three dimensional wedge geometries, while testing the dependence of the final solution on various physical models. Numerical analyses revealed the requirement for simulating this problem in three dimensions and improved turbulence modeling to account for relatively high levels of anisotropy. Velocity and turbulent measurements of non-reacting and combusting jets were made with a laser Doppler anemometer to validate numerical models. Excellent agreement was found between predicted and measured velocity and turbulent quantities for cold flow cases. However, numerical predictions did not agree quite as well with experiments of the flame due to limitations in modeling techniques and flow tracking abilities of tracer particles used in experimentation. ; Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-28 13:05:54.365</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Geometric Jacobian Linearization</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tyner, David</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>For control systems that evolve on Euclidean spaces, Jacobian linearization is a common technique in many control applications, analysis, and controller design methodologies. However, the standard linearization method along a non-trivial reference trajectory does not directly apply in a geometric theory where the state space is a differentiable manifold. Indeed, the standard constructions involving the Jacobian are dependent on a choice of coordinates. The procedure of linearizing a control affine system along a non-trivial reference trajectory is studied from a differential geometric perspective. A coordinate-invariant setting for linearization is presented. With the linearization in hand, the controllability of the geometric linearization is characterized using an alternative version of the usual controllability test for time-varying linear systems. The various types of stability are defined using a metric on the fibers along the reference trajectory and Lyapunov's second method is recast for linear vector fields on tangent bundles. With the necessary background stated in a geometric framework, Kalman's theory of quadratic optimal control is understood from the perspective of the Maximum Principle. Finally, following Kalman, the resulting feedback from solving the infinite time optimal control problem is shown to uniformly asymptotically stabilize the linearization using Lyapunov's second method. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2007-12-19 16:59:47.76</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Low energy solar neutrino analysis of the salt phase of the Sudbury neutrino observatory</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kos, Mark Szymon</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The neutrino fluxes from the neutral current (NC), charged current (CC), and elastic scattering (ES) neutrino interactions in the salt phase of SNO have been extracted. The signals were extracted above an energy threshold of 4MeV, which is the lowest energy threshold at which the neutrino signals have been extracted from SNO to date. To achieve this low energy threshold the internal and external radioactive background signals have also been measured. The $^{8}$B neutrino fluxes for the 4MeV threshold were found to be \begin{eqnarray*} \Phi_{CC} &amp; = &amp; 1.60 ~^{+0.04}_{-0.04}~(\mbox{stat}) ~^{+0.06}_{-0.06}~(\mbox{syst}) \times 10^6 \mbox{cm}^{-2} \mbox{sec}^{-1},\\ \Phi_{NC} &amp; = &amp; 4.84 ~^{+0.16}_{-0.16}~(\mbox{stat}) ~^{+0.29}_{-0.32}~(\mbox{syst}) \times 10^6 \mbox{cm}^{-2} \mbox{sec}^{-1},\\ \Phi_{ES} &amp; = &amp; 2.75 ~^{+0.23}_{-0.23}~(\mbox{stat}) ~^{+0.25}_{-0.26}~(\mbox{syst}) \times 10^6 \mbox{cm}^{-2} \mbox{sec}^{-1}. \end{eqnarray*} \noindent These results are in agreement with the values published in ~\cite{SNO3} and the NC flux is in agreement with the standard solar model calculation from ~\cite{bp2004}. The published fluxes were \begin{eqnarray*} \Phi_{CC} &amp;= &amp; 1.68 ~^{+0.06}_{-0.06}~(\mbox{stat}) ~^{+0.08}_{-0.09}~(\mbox{syst}) \times 10^6 \mbox{cm}^{-2} \mbox{sec}^{-1} , \\ \Phi_{NC} &amp;= &amp; 4.94 ~^{+0.21}_{-0.21}~(\mbox{stat}) ~^{+0.38}_{-0.34}~(\mbox{syst}) \times 10^6 \mbox{cm}^{-2} \mbox{sec}^{-1}, \\ \Phi_{ES} &amp;= &amp; 2.35 ~^{+0.22}_{-0.22}~(\mbox{stat}) ~^{+0.15}_{-0.15}~(\mbox{syst}) \times 10^6 \mbox{cm}^{-2} \mbox{sec}^{-1}. \end{eqnarray*} \noindent The uncertainties on the extracted NC and CC fluxes are significantly smaller than on the published values. A comparison of the total uncertainty from flux measurements presented here and those published are given below. \begin{table}[htp] \begin{center} \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline &amp; uncertainties presented here (\%) &amp; uncertainties from ~\cite{SNO3} (\%) \\ \hline $\Phi_{CC}$ &amp; $~^{+4.6}_{-4.4}$ &amp; $~^{+5.9}_{-6.4}$ \\ \hline $\Phi_{NC}$ &amp; $~^{+6.8}_{-7.4}$ &amp; $~^{+8.9}_{-8.2}$ \\ \hline $\Phi_{ES}$ &amp; $~^{+12.3}_{-12.6}$ &amp; $~^{+11.3}_{-11.3}$ \\ \hline \end{tabular} \label{funcert1} \end{center} \end{table} The shape of the CC energy spectrum has also been extracted with the 4MeV energy threshold. The uncertainties on the extracted fluxes are smaller than what was previously published. The CC spectrum gives a measure of the neutrino energy shape distortion due to neutrino oscillations. The uncertainties on the lowest energy bins in the extracted CC spectrum are much larger than the predicted distortion. We are therefore not sensitive to the upturn in the neutrino survival probability at lower energies predicted by neutrino oscillations in the large mixing angle (LMA) region. ; Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2007-12-19 13:58:16.601</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Time-Gated Fourier-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Muller, Matthew S.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been shown to be a versatile three-dimensional imaging tool in diagnostic medicine, combining micrometre-scale resolutions with fast acquisition times. This imaging modality uses the interference between light backscattered from a sample and light that has traversed a known reference path delay to determine the scattering profile over penetration depths of up to several millimetres in tissue. A novel OCT system is presented that uses nonlinear optics to process the backscattered light in the optical domain prior to standard Fourier-domain OCT acquisition and processing. The nonlinear optical effects experienced between short light pulses are strongly intensity-dependent, occurring only significantly when the pulses are temporally and spatially overlapped. These conditions allow for the creation of a user-controlled time gate that restricts the light backscattered from the sample to a narrow (~100 micrometres) depth field of view prior to detection. When strong and weak scattering interfaces exist across the sample depth range, the signal-to-noise ratio of the weaker scattering sites can be limited by the finite detector dynamic range in Fourier-domain OCT systems. By aligning the time gate temporal delay to the backscatter from the weak interfaces of interest, a user can completely remove the strong backscattered light and enhance imaging contrast. The nonlinear effect used in the current time-gated OCT design is sum-frequency generation, which provides an additional advantage of imaging at near infrared (1280 nm) wavelengths, used for long penetration depths in tissue, while detection is performed in the visible (504 nm) with silicon-based camera technology. With the reduced depth field of view, the number of sampling points required per depth scan is also proportionately reduced, permitting faster acquisition rates for the time-gated region of interest. A complete description of the time-gated OCT system design is presented, along with proof-of-concept images demonstrating contrast enhancement and operation in a highly scattering biological medium. Based on its successful initial performance, future development of this system is expected for its eventual use in many OCT imaging applications. ; Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2008-01-15 20:05:41.665 ; This work was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Cancer Imaging Network of Ontario, supported by Cancer Care Ontario</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Coded aperture imaging application in one-sided imaging of visually obscured objects</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Scott, William</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The physical properties of visible light and its interaction with matter create obstructions the human eye cannot explore. High energy radiation has been used as an alternative to visible light to penetrate these concealed regions and reveal their contents. However, traditional imaging techniques require a two-sided apparatus with a radiation source and a detector on opposite sides of the concealed object. One-sided imaging of concealed objects is made possible by a technique called backscatter imaging, utilizing high energy radiation. However, the signal produced by backscatter imaging is inherently weak, which makes in- terpretation di cult. One of the most promising techniques for recovering the weak signal is the coding and decoding provided by Coded Aperture Imaging (CAI). The purpose of this study was to create and test a coded aperture imaging system using backscattered x-rays. This would enable one-sided imaging of concealed objects and demonstrate whether a portable imaging system was feasible. The results obtained from conducting a computer simulation, visi- ble light experiments, and x-ray experiments proved that the process works, however, the x-ray ux levels required were too high for a portable system, based upon the current equipment available at UOIT. ; UOIT</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The application of experimental microdosimetry to mixed-field neutron-gamma dosimetry</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Al-Bayati, Saad Najm</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Absorbed dose distributions in lineal energy for neutrons and gamma rays were measured by using both a tissue-equivalent walled counter (TEPC) and a graphite-walled low pressure proportional counter (GPC) in the Am-Be neutron source facility at UOIT. A series of measurements were performed with the counters filled with propane-based TE gas (55.1% C3H8, 39.5% CO2 and 5.4% N2) at operating gas pressures corresponding to tissue spheres 2.0 , 4.0 and 8.0 μm in diameter. The results of these measurements indicated satisfactory performance of counters to measure microdosimetric spectra extending down to event-sizes that cover the gamma component of a mixed field. The spectra and the related mean values ̅y F and ̅y D are compared with other similar work but with monoenergetic neutrons of different energy range, the agreement between them is good. An assessment of the performance of different size TEPC has been done. An excellent agreement between their event size spectra was found and the proton edge appears at the same position on the lineal energy scale and differences in microdosimetric parameters ̅ and ̅ is not exceeding 3%, which is in the region of counting statistics. In Am-Be neutron field, the efficiency of the TEPCs was measured to have an average value of 250 counts per μSv or equivalently about 4.17 counts per minutes per μSv/hr. This efficiency is reasonable for dose equivalent measurements but needs a long integration period. The measurements showed that the dose equivalent which depends on the measurement of energy deposition by the secondary charged particles was originated mainly from elastic collisions of the incident neutrons with hydrogen atoms. Moreover the number of events in the sensitive gas is dominated by proton recoils. A non- negligible fraction of the dose equivalent resulted from gamma interactions, alpha and recoil nuclei. The energy deposition patterns in these micro-scale targets are strongly dependent on radiation quality, so differences of linear energy transfer (LET) of the components in a mixed radiation field are significant. Accordingly, in a radiation field with an unknown gamma ray energy spectrum, absorbed dose for neutrons can be obtained by the separation of neutron induced events from gamma events using their distribution in lineal energy. To separate neutron dose from gamma dose a simple lineal energy threshold technique has been used in addition to a more sophisticated methods using γ-fitting and the graphite-walled counter measurements. The results of this study will establish the degree of error introduced by using a lineal energy threshold, which is likely to be used in any hand-held neutron monitor based on TEPCs. ; UOIT</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Convection in a differentially heated rotating spherical shell of Boussinesq fluid with radiative forcing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Babalola, David</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this study we investigate the flow of a Boussinesq fluid contained in a rotating, differentially heated spherical shell. Previous work, on the spherical shell of Boussinesq fluid, differentially heated the shell by prescribing temperature on the inner boundary of the shell, setting the temperature deviation from the reference temperature to vary proportionally with -cos 20, from the equator to the pole. We change the model to include an energy balance equation at the earth's surface, which incorporates latitudinal solar radiation distribution and ice-albedo feedback mechanism with moving ice boundary. For the fluid velocity, on the inner boundary, two conditions are considered: stress-free and no-slip. However, the model under consideration contains only simple representations of a small number of climate variables and thus is not a climate model per se but rather a tool to aid in understanding how changes in these variables may affect our planet's climate. The solution of the model is followed as the differential heating is changed, using the pseudo arc-length continuation method, which is a reliable method that can successfully follow a solution curve even at a turning point. Our main result is in regards to hysteresis phenomenon that is associated with transition from one to multiple convective cells, in a dfferentially heated, co-rotating spherical shell. In particular, we find that hysteresis can be observed without transition from one to multiple convective cells. Another important observation is that the transition to multiple convective cells is significantly suppressed altogether, in the case of stress-free boundary conditions on the fluid velocity. Also, the results of this study will be related to our present-day climate. ; UOIT</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dynamical effects in crystalline solid state systems: theory of temperature dependent optical response of bulk gaAs and vibrational modification of C(111) 2 x 1 Surface in Comparison to Experiment</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Teatro, Timothy A.V.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents a new theoretical formalism which incorporates dynamical effects in atomistic electronic structure and related calculations. This research, fundamental by nature, brings about a deeper understanding of the dynamical processes in a range of materials. This establishes technologically important correlation with experimentally measured macroscopic properties and materials characterization. This method—the first of its kind—is a natural and long overdue extension of customary adiabatically separated time-independent electronic structure methods. It accounts explicitly for atomic motion due to thermal and zero-point vibration. The approach developed requires no direct treatment of time dependence in the quantum mechanical calculations, making the method widely applicable utilizing currently available electronic structure and ab-initio molecular dynamics software. The formalism is extensively applied and demonstrated for the linear optical response of bulk gallium arsenide and electronic structure of the C(111) 2 x 1 surface. Both cases are complimented by comparison of key observables to experimental data which may be used to judge the quality of the results. The results are found to be in good agreement with experimental data, with most exceptions being readily explainable and well understood.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Growth, survivability, and reproductive effects of pulse-dosed endosulfan on jordanella floridae (florida flagfish) over one complete life-cycle</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Beyger, Lindsay Alexandra</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Endosulfan is a commonly used organochlorine in Durham Region, Ontario Canada which has known toxic effects on non-target organisms including fish. This research investigated the effects of endosulfan on Florida flagfish (Jordanella floridae), using both continuous and pulse-exposure. The 96 hour continuous exposure LC50 in larval flagfish was 4.35 μg/L; sub-lethal observations included hyperactivity, convulsions, and some axis malformation. The effects of a 4 hour endosulfan pulse-exposure on 7-8 day-old larval growth, reproduction, and survivability were investigated over one full life-cycle. The 4 hour pulse-exposure LC50 value for larval flagfish was 49.7 μg/L; there were no growth or reproductive effects of endosulfan pulse-exposure up to the highest exposure concentration of 10 μg/L. Thus, the life-cycle 4-h pulse-exposure no observed effect concentration (NOEC) and lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) were 3.2 and 10 μg/L endosulfan, respectively, due to significantly higher mortality.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The Marnoch heat engine (MHE) is a new type of power generation device that is under research and development at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. In this thesis, the transient heat transfer behaviour of the source heat exchanger of the Marnoch heat engine is studied, and its operation for laminar and turbulent flows is modelled. The temperature variations of the working fluid, the heating fluid and the wall, are calculated. The temperature distribution of the fluids and the wall over the length of the heat exchanger is also calculated. It is found that the temperature of the working fluid rises sharply to a peak and then gradually decreases. The wall temperature decreases exponentially, and the temperature of the heating fluid falls sharply, and then gradually decreases. A base model for the step change in the mass flow of the working fluid is developed and compared against past works for the purpose of validation. ; UOIT</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A generic methodology for the three dimensional display of radiation fields</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chaput, Joseph</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The radiation field visualization options available for engineers, scientists and health physicists have traditionally been based in the 2d realm, with techniques such as the generation of isodose curves. From the perspective of a health physicist the creation of 3d visuals to illustrate radiation levels within an environment is an invaluable tool both for training and As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) radiation dose planning. This thesis describes a novel technique for the creation of 3d visualizations of radiation fields. The methodology is developed and shown to be effective within the Google SketchUp Computer Aided Design (CAD) software package. The methodology takes an input file of information stored in coordinate form with a representative value at each point. It constructs elemental shapes automatically within Google SketchUp at those coordinates. All shapes are associated with an intensity value related to a pre-defined scale. The shapes are colorized and enhanced with transparency effects to complete a radiation field visualization scene. ; UOIT</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Effect of Inlet Temperature Non-Uniformity on High-Pressure Turbine Performance</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Smith, Craig I.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The temperature of the flow entering a high-pressure turbine stage is inherently non-uniform, as it is produced by several discrete, azimuthally-distributed combustors. In general, however, industrial simulations assume inlet temperature uniformity to simplify the preparation process and reduce computation time. The effects of a non-uniform inlet field on the performance of a commercial, transonic, single-stage, high-pressure, axial turbine with a curved inlet duct have been investigated numerically by performing URANS (Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations) simulations with the SST (Shear Stress Transport) turbulence model. By adjusting the alignment of the experimentally-based inlet temperature field with respect to the stator vanes, two clocking configurations were generated: a vane-impinging (VI) case , in which each hot streak impinged on a vane; and a mid-pitch (MP) case, in which each hot streak passed between two vanes. In the VI configuration, the hot streaks produced higher time-averaged heat load on the vanes and lower heat load on the blades. As the hot streaks in the VI case passed over the stator vanes, they also spread spanwise due to the actions of the casing passage vortices and the radial pressure gradient; this resulted in a stream entering the rotor with relatively low temperature variations. The hot streaks in the MP case were convected undisturbed past the relatively cool vane section. Relatively high time-averaged enthalpy values were found to occur on the pressure side of the blades in the MP configuration. The non-uniformity of the time-averaged enthalpy on the blade surfaces was lower in the VI configuration. The flow exiting the rotor section was much less non-uniform in the VI case, but differences in calculated efficiency were not significant. ; Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada, NSERC</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Amplification of Long-Range Surface Plasmon-Polaritons</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>De Leon Arizpe, Israel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Surface plasmon-polaritons are optical surface waves formed through the interaction of photons with free electrons at the surface of metals. They offer interesting applications in a broad range of scientific fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, and material science. However, many of such applications face limitations imposed by the high propagation losses of these waves at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, which result mainly from power dissipation in the metal. In principle, the propagation losses of surface plasmon-polaritons can be compensated through optical amplification. The objective of this thesis is to provide deeper insights on the physics of surface plasmon-polariton amplification and spontaneous emission in surface plasmon-polariton amplifiers through theoretical and experimental vehicles applied (but not necessarily restricted) to a particular plasmonic mode termed long-range surface plasmon-polariton. On the theoretical side, the objective is approached by developing a realistic theoretical model to describe the small-signal amplification of surface plasmon-polaritons in planar structures incorporating dipolar gain media such as organic dye molecules, rare-earth ions, and quantum dots. This model takes into account the inhomogeneous gain distribution formed near the metal surface due to a non-uniform excitation of dipoles and due to a position-dependent excited-state dipole lifetime that results from near-field interactions between the excited dipoles and the metal. Also, a theoretical model to describe the amplified spontaneous emission of surface plasmon-polaritons supported by planar metallic structures is developed. This model takes into account the different energy decay channels into which an exited dipole located in the vicinity of the metal can relax. The validity of this model is confirmed through experimentation. On the experimental side, the objective is approached by providing a direct experimental demonstration of complete loss compensation in a plasmonic waveguide. The experiments are conducted using the long-range surface plasmon-polariton supported by a symmetric thin gold waveguide incorporating optically pumped organic dye molecules in solution as the gain medium. Also, an experimental study of spontaneous emission in a long-range surface plasmon-polariton amplifier is presented. It is shown that this amplifier benefits from a low spontaneous emission into the amplified mode, which leads to an optical amplifier with low noise characteristics. The experimental setup and techniques are explained in detail.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Signal and Noise Time –domain Models for Microwave FETs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Asadi, Shahrooz</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Accurate characterization of active devices is one of the most crucial steps in efficient microwave circuit design. As the operating frequency increases, the dimensions of the electrodes of microwave transistors such as FETs become comparable to the wavelength, highlighting the parasitic effect of wave propagation and phase cancellation. Thus, this effect needs to be accurately evaluated in the device model to assure a reliable design. In this work, we proposed new small- and large-signal FET models for efficient millimeter-wave circuit design. In our approach, the device width was divided into an infinity number of segments, while each segment was considered as a combination of three coupled lines and a conventional FET equivalent circuit. By solving a set of multiconductor transmission line equations using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) technique, an accurate and efficient transistor modeling approach has been introduced. Furthermore, a new distributed noise FET model was proposed. It consists in a threecoupled excited transmission line (TL) structure in which the Laplace transformation was applied to determine the noise currents and voltages of lines. The structure was also analyzed by applying the Green's function concept as a wave approach. The proposed distributed mm-wave noise FET model has been demonstrated through successful comparison with measurements.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Analysis of Pipeline Systems Under Harmonic Forces</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Salahifar, Raydin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Starting with tensor calculus and the variational form of the Hamiltonian functional, a generalized theory is formulated for doubly curved thin shells. The formulation avoids geometric approximations commonly adopted in other formulations. The theory is then specialized for cylindrical and toroidal shells as special cases, both of interest in the modeling of straight and elbow segments of pipeline systems. Since the treatment avoids geometric approximations, the cylindrical shell theory is believed to be more accurate than others reported in the literature. By adopting a set of consistent geometric approximations, the present theory is shown to revert to the well known Flugge shell theory. Another set of consistent geometric approximations is shown to lead to the Donnell-Mushtari-Vlasov (DMV) theory. A general closed form solution of the theory is developed for cylinders under general harmonic loads. The solution is then used to formulate a family of exact shape functions which are subsequently used to formulate a super-convergent finite element. The formulation efficiently and accurately captures ovalization, warping, radial expansion, and other shell behavioural modes under general static or harmonic forces either in-phase or out-of-phase. Comparisons with shell solutions available in Abaqus demonstrate the validity of the formulation and the accuracy of its predictions. The generalized thin shell theory is then specialized for toroidal shells. Consistent sets of approximations lead to three simplified theories for toroidal shells. The first set of approximations has lead to a theory comparable to that of Sanders while the second set of approximation has lead to a theory nearly identical to the DMV theory for toroidal shells. A closed form solution is then obtained for the governing equation. Exact shape functions are then developed and subsequently used to formulate a finite element. Comparisons with Abaqus solutions show the validity of the formulation for short elbow segments under a variety of loading conditions. Because of their efficiency, the finite elements developed are particularly suited for the analysis of long pipeline systems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Phase Shifting Surface (PSS) and Phase and Amplitude Shifting Surface (PASS) for Microwave Applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gagnon, Nicolas</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis describes an electrically thin surface used for electromagnetic applications in the microwave regime. The surface is free-standing and its primary purpose is to modify the phase distribution, or the phase and amplitude distribution of electromagnetic fields propagating through it: it is called phase shifting surface (PSS) in the first case, and phase and amplitude shifting surface (PASS) in the second case. For practical applications, the surface typically comprises three or four layers of metallic patterns spaced by dielectric layers. The patterns of the metallic layers are designed to locally alter the phase (and amplitude in the case of the PASS) of an incoming wave to a prescribed set of desired values for the outgoing wave. The PSS/PASS takes advantage of the reactive coupling by closely spacing of the metallic layers, which results in a larger phase shift range while keeping the structure significantly thin. The PSS concept is used to design components such as gratings and lens antennas which are presented in this document. The components are designed for an operating frequency of 30 GHz. The PSS phase grating gives high diffraction efficiency, even higher than a dielectric phase grating. Several types of lens antennas are also presented, which show comparable performance to that of a conventional dielectric plano-hyperbolic lens antenna with similar parameters. The PASS concept is used in a beam shaping application in which a flat-topped beam antenna is designed. This work demonstrates the potential for realising thin, lightweight and low-cost antennas at Ka band, in particular for substituting higher-gain antenna technologies such as conventional dielectric shaped lens antennas.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Brar, Jamie</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The photoluminescence (PL) of dense aggregates of CdSe/Cd0.5Zn0.5S core/shell colloidal quantum dots (cQDs) was investigated to gain insight into bleaching processes, quantum efficiency behaviour, band gap energy temperature dependence, and the phonon-coupling contribution to thermal broadening. This work also encompassed a study of various sample preparation techniques. These newly investigated strain-engineered core/shell cQDs, having an effective lattice constant in between that of CdS and ZnS, fosters the study of novel properties not present in the previous two systems. The bleaching behaviour, studied subject to strong optical pumping for different external cQD environments, showed effective shell passivation, thus limiting non-radiative processes mainly to the core or shell structures. The relative quantum efficiency was determined as a function of temperature, showing two distinct regimes, with activation of a phonon process above ~ 180 K. The band gap energy was found to follow the empirical Varshni relation describing the temperature dependence of a semiconductor material, dominating any thermally induced changes of the cQD volume and confinement potential. The PL spectral width change with temperature showed highly coupled carrier-phonon scattering behaviour.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Fully Customizable Anatomically Correct Model of the Crystalline Lens</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wilson, Cynthia Nicole</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The human eye is a complex optical system comprised of many components. The crystalline lens, an optical component with a gradient index (GRIN), is perhaps the least understood as it is situated inside the eye and as a result is difficult to characterize. Its complex nonlinear structure is not easily measured and consequently not easily modeled. Presently several models of the GRIN structure exist describing the average performance of crystalline lenses. These models, however, do not accurately describe the performance of crystalline lenses on an individual basis and a more accurate individual eye model based on anatomical parameters is needed. This thesis proposes an anatomically correct, individually customizable crystalline lens model. This is an important tool and is needed both for research on the optical properties of human eyes and to diagnose and plan the treatment of optically based visual problems, such as refractive surgery planning. The lens model consisted of an interior GRIN with a constant refractive index core. The anterior and posterior surface was described by conic sections. To realize this eye model, the optical and biometric properties of mammalian lenses were measured and the correlation relationships between these measurements were used to simplify the model down to one fitting parameter which controls the shape of the GRIN. Using this data, an anatomically correct individualizable model of the lens was successfully realized with varying parameters unique to each lens. Using this customizable lens model, customizable human eye models based on measurements of the entire human eye can be realized.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Role of Vorticity, Turbulence and Three-dimensional Flow Structure on the Development of Scour</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jamieson, Elizabeth Clare</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Fundamental to the understanding of how rivers transform and shape our environment is the role of turbulence and complex, three-dimensional flow, such as vorticity, in sediment transport and erosion. However, classical sediment transport models (or formulae) are based, for the most part, on boundary shear stress and do not incorporate these natural phenomena. This is understandable given that the relationship between turbulence generation, intensity and form; the influence of turbulence on mobile sediment; and the magnitude and patterns of deposition and erosion are complex and difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, the failure to incorporate turbulence and complex, three-dimensional flow into existing models means that our understanding of sediment transport remains incomplete. The central hypothesis of this thesis is that vortical motion is the main factor in the development of local scour. To examine this, a comprehensive experimental approach was taken. This approach involved detailed measurements of the unique three-dimensional patterns of velocity, turbulence and bed morphology associated with flow in an open channel with and without the presence of submerged groyne-like structures (stream barbs and wing dikes) at both the laboratory and field scales. Using densely spaced velocity data and new techniques for processing and analyzing these data, it was possible to identify complex features of the flow field at both scales, such as the presence of vortex cores, and correlate these with changes in bed levels. These data provide a unique perspective of the spatial variability of velocity, turbulence and bed morphology in open channels (and in particular in channel bends, where flow is highly three-dimensional). In particular, it was found that, of the flow parameters analyzed, turbulent stresses were most correlated to scour in channel bends without the presence of structures. In contrast, vorticity was found to be the dominant factor in local scour hole development in the vicinity of submerged structures at both the laboratory and field scale. Such data are rare (if non-existent) in existing experimental research, particularly at the scale of a large natural river. This research also examines stream barb design and performance. Stream barbs (also known as submerged groynes or spur dikes) are a relatively novel approach to stream bank protection and are not common in Canada. The design and installation of stream barbs in a creek in Ottawa (Sawmill Creek) was undertaken to serve as a demonstration project for the use of these structures in a semi-alluvial channel, for which no such case studies exist. Three years of monitoring the site and the performance of these structures to reduce bank erosion and improve aquatic habitat have been carried out. Laboratory testing of stream barb performance was also undertaken and showed that with improper design, the outer bank in a channel bend may be more susceptible to erosion due to excessive local scour downstream of the barb. In particular, to avoid bank erosion downstream of the barb, barbs should be small, such that they create minimum flow obstruction, and include a bank key that is wider than the barb itself and extends in the downstream direction.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>All-optical Microwave Signal Processing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Han, Yichen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Microwave signal processing in the optical domain is investigated in this thesis. Two signal processors including an all-optical fractional Hilbert transformer and an all-optical microwave differentiator are investigated and experimentally demonstrated. Specifically, the photonic-assisted fractional Hilbert transformer with tunable fractional order is implemented based on a temporal pulse shaping system incorporating a phase modulator. By applying a step function to the phase modulator to introduce a phase jump, a real-time fractional Hilbert transformer with a tunable fractional order is achieved. The microwave bandpass differentiator is implemented based on a finite impulse response (FIR) photonic microwave delay-line filter with nonuniformly-spaced taps. A microwave bandpass differentiator based on a six-tap nonuniformly-spaced photonic microwave delay-line filter with all- positive coefficients is designed, simulated, and experimentally demonstrated. The reconfigurability of the microwave bandpass differentiator is experimentally investigated. The employment of the differentiator to perform differentiation of a bandpass microwave signal is also experimentally demonstrated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Example-Based Fluid Simulation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chang, Ming</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We present a novel method for example-based simulation of fluid flow. We reconstruct fluid animation from physically based fluid simulation examples. Our framework shows how to decompose a given series of fluid motion example data into small units and then recompose them. We capture the properties of local fluid behavior by dicing the fluid motion example data into sequences of fragments, which have smaller volume and shorter length. We build a database out of these fragments, and propose a matching strategy to generate new fluid animation. To achieve highly efficient database query, we project our fragments onto lower dimensional subspace using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach, and construct our data structure as a kd-tree by treating each fragment as a point in this subspace. Our method has been implemented in synthesizing both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) fluid’s velocity fields.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Generation, Characterization and Application of the 3rd and 4th Harmonics of a Ti:sapphire Femtosecond Laser</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wright, Peter</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (fsTRPES) experiments have been used to study the photoelectron energy spectra of simple molecules since the 1980’s. Analysis of these spectra provides information about the ultrafast internal conversion dynamics of the parent ions. However, ultraviolet pulses must be used for these pump-probe experiments in order to ionize the molecules. Since current solid state lasers, such as the Ti:sapphire laser, typically produce pulses centered at 800nm, it is necessary to generate UV pulses with nonlinear frequency mixing techniques. I therefore constructed an optical setup to generate the 3rd and 4th harmonics, at 266.7nm and 200nm, respectively, of a Ti:sapphire (Ti:sa) chirped-pulse amplified (CPA) laser system that produces 35fs pulses centered at 800nm. Thin Beta-Barium Borate (β-BaB2O4 or BBO) crystals were chosen to achieve a compromise between short pulse durations and reasonable conversion efficiencies, since ultrashort pulses are quite susceptible to broadening from group velocity dispersion (GVD). Output energies of around 11μJ and 230nJ were measured for the 266.7nm and 200nm pulses, respectively. The transform limits of the 3rd and 4th harmonic pulse lengths were calculated from their measured spectral widths. We found that the 266.7nm bandwidth was large enough to support sub-30fs pulses, and due to cutting at the lower-wavelength end of the 200nm spectrum, we calculated an upper limit of 38fs. The pulses were compressed with pairs of CaF2 prisms to compensate for dispersion introduced by transmissive optics. Two-photon absorption (TPA) intensity autocorrelations revealed fully compressed pulse lengths of 36 ± 2 fs and 42 ± 4 fs for the 3rd and 4th harmonics, respectively.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Multinuclear Solid-State Magnetic Resonance Studies on ‘Exotic’ Quadrupolar Nuclei: Acquisition Methods, High-Order Effects, Quantum Chemical Computations, and NMR Crystallography</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Widdifield, Cory</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This dissertation attempts to extend the classes of halogen-containing systems which may be studied using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR). As line shape broadening due to the quadrupolar interaction (QI) scales inversely with the applied field, high-field magnet technology is indispensable for this research. Combining advanced radiofrequency pulse sequences with high-field wideline data acquisition allowed for the collection of very broad SSNMR signals of all quadrupolar halogen nuclei (i.e., 35/37Cl, 79/81Br and 127I) within a reasonable amount of experimental time. The initial systems for study were of the MX2 variety (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba; X = Cl, Br, I). In total, 9 anhydrous compounds were tested. The effects of hydrate formation were tested on 7 additional compounds. Systematic trends in the observed δiso values (and to a lesser extent, Ω and CQ) were found to be diagnostic of the extent of hydration in these materials. Resolving power was successfully tested using SrBr2, which possesses 4 magnetically unique sites. The composition of CaBr2•xH2O was convincingly determined using SSNMR data and the hydration trends noted above. The sensitivity of the QI to the local bonding environment (e.g., bond distance changes of less than 0.05 Å) was used to refine (when coupled with gauge-including projector augmented-wave density functional theory (GIPAW DFT) quantum chemical computations) the structure of MgBr2, and was used to correct prior NMR data for CaCl2 (earlier accounts had been performed upon a CaCl2 hydrate). During NMR data analysis of certain iodine-containing materials, it was found that standard fitting software (which uses perturbation theory) could not reproduce the observations. Proper analysis required the use of exact simulation software and allowed for the observation of high-order quadrupole-induced effects (HOQIE). This motivated further studies using rhenium-185/187 nuclei, where it was expected that HOQIE would be more dramatic. The observed rhenium SSNMR spectra possessed additional fine structure that had never been observed before experimentally, nor would be expected from currently-available perturbation theory analysis software. Lastly, preliminary results are shown where 127I SSNMR is used to study important supramolecular systems, and the composition of the popular synthetic reagent ‘GaI’ is elucidated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Origin of Wave Blocking for a Bistable Reaction-Diffusion Equation : A General Approach</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Roy, Christian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Mathematical models displaying travelling waves appear in a variety of domains. These waves are often faced with different kinds of perturbations. In some cases, these perturbations result in propagation failure, also known as wave-blocking. Wave-blocking has been studied in the case of several specific models, often with the help of numerical tools. In this thesis, we will display a technique that uses symmetry and a center manifold reduction to find a criterion which defines regions in parameter space where a wave will be blocked. We focus on waves with low velocity and small symmetry-breaking perturbations, which is where the blocking initiates; the organising center. The range of the tools used makes the technique easily generalizable to higher dimensions. In order to demonstrate this technique, we apply it to the bistable equation. This allows us to do calculations explicitly. As a result, we show that wave-blocking occurs inside a wedge originating from the organising center and derive an expression for this wedge to leading order. We verify our results with some numerical simulations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electrostatic Control of Single InAs Quantum Dots Using InP Nanotemplates</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cheriton, Ross</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis focuses on pioneering a scalable route to fabricate quantum information devices based upon single InAs/InP quantum dots emitting in the telecommunications wavelength band around 1550 nm. Using metallic gates in combination with nanotemplate, site-selective epitaxy techniques, arrays of single quantum dots are produced and electrostatically tuned with a high degree of control over the electrical and optical properties of each individual quantum dot. Using metallic gates to apply local electric fields, the number of electrons within each quantum dot can be tuned and the nature of the optical recombination process controlled. Four electrostatic gates mounted along the sides of a square-based, pyramidal nanotemplate in combination with a flat metallic gate on the back of the InP substrate allow the application of electric fields in any direction across a single quantum dot. Using lateral fields provided by the metallic gates on the sidewalls of the pyramid and a vertical electric field able to control the charge state of the quantum dot, the exchange splitting of the exciton, trion and biexciton are measured as a function of gate voltage. A quadrupole electric field configuration is predicted to symmetrize the product of electron and hole wavefunctions within the dot, producing two degenerate exciton states from the two possible optical decay pathways of the biexciton. Building upon these capabilities, the anisotropic exchange splitting between the exciton states within the biexciton cascade is shown to be reversibly tuned through zero for the first time. We show direct control over the electron and hole wavefunction symmetry, thus enabling the entanglement of emitted photon pairs in asymmetric quantum dots. Optical spectroscopy of single InAs/InP quantum dots atop pyramidal nanotemplates in magnetic fields up to 28T is used to examine the dispersion of the s, p and d shell states. The g-factor and diamagnetic shift of the exciton and charged exciton states from over thirty single quantum dots are calculated from the spectra. The g-factor shows a generally linear dependence on dot emission energy, in agreement with previous work on this subject. A positive linear correlation between diamagnetic coefficient and g-factor is observed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Periodic Plasmonic Nanoantennas in a Piecewise Homogeneous Background</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Siadat Mousavi, Saba</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Optical nanoantennas have raised much interest during the past decade for their vast potential in photonics applications. This thesis investigates the response of periodic arrays of nanomonopoles and nanodipoles on a silicon substrate, covered by water, to variations of antenna dimensions. These arrays are illuminated by a plane wave source located inside the silicon substrate. Modal analysis was performed and the mode in the nanoantennas was identified. By characterizing the properties of this mode certain response behaviours of the system were explained. Expressions are offered to predict approximately the resonant length of nanomonopoles and nanodipoles, by accounting for the fringing fields at the antenna ends and the effects of the gap in dipoles. These expressions enable one to predict the resonant length of nanomonopoles within 20% and nanodipoles within 10% error, which significantly facilitates the design of such antennas for specific applications.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Novel Remodulation Scheme for WDM PONs Using DPSK for Both Downstream and Upstream</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Deb, Nebras</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Wavelength Division Multiplexing Passive Optical Networks (WDM PONs) offer a great solution to satisfy the increasing demand of bandwidth. In addition, it offers a higher level of data security through virtual point to point connections. A great challenge in realizing cost-effective WDM PON is the need for a transmitter at each Optical Network Unit (ONU) with a dedicated wavelength, which overloads the total cost of the system, in addition to reducing the number of available wavelengths in the system. Remodulation scheme is an ultimate solution for these problems of WDM PONs as the downstream signal itself is remodulated with upstream data which saves the need for a laser source at the ONU side. In this thesis I propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel wavelength remodulation scheme for WDM PONs that employs Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) for downstream and Return to Zero DPSK (RZ-DPSK) for upstream. The use of DPSK enhanced the system with improved receiver sensitivity and RZ-DPSK improved the tolerance toward chromatic dispersion. In addition, I investigate the Backreflection (BR) penalty resulting from beat noise of BRs with upstream signal in a bidirectional WDM PON system that uses remodulation and phase modulation as a modulation format. I experimentally demonstrate the optimal conditions to operate the system and minimize the BR penalty.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Micro PIV and Numerical Investigation of a Micro-Couette Blood Flow</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mehri, Rym</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The purpose of this thesis is to design a physical microchannel model for micro-Couette blood flow that provides constant and controlled conditions to study and analyze Red Blood Cell (RBC) aggregation. The innovation of this work is that the Couette blood flow is created by the motion of a second fluid with different properties, thereby entraining the blood. The experimental work is coupled with three-dimensional numerical simulations performed using a research Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) Solver, Nek5000, based on the spectral element method, while the experiments are conducted using a micro Particle Image Velocimetry (μPIV) system with a double frame CCD camera and an inverted laser imaging microscope. The design of the channel (150 × 33 μm and 170 × 64 μm microchannels) is based on several parameters determined numerically, such as the velocity and viscosity ratios and the degree of miscibility between the fluids, and the resulting configurations are fabricated in the laboratory using standard photolithography methods. The microchannel designed numerically is then tested experimentally, first, with a Newtonian fluid (glycerol), then with RBC suspensions to be compared to the simulations results. It was found that, numerically, using a velocity ratio of 4 between the two fluids, a third of the channel thickness corresponds to the blood layer. Within that range, it can be concluded, that the velocity profile of the blood layer is approximately linear as confirmed by experimental tests, resulting in the desired profile to study RBC aggregation in controlled conditions. The effect of several parameters, such as the hematocrit and the shear rate, on the RBC aggregates and the velocity profile is investigated, through experiments on the RBC suspensions. The final goal of this research is to ensure the compatibility of the results between the experiments and the Newtonian numerical model for several ranges of shear rate with the future intention of finding an accurate method to be able to quantitatively analyze aggregates and determine the number of RBC in each aggregate depending on the flow conditions (the shear rate).</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Beyond Classical Nucleation Theory: A 2-D Lattice-Gas Automata Model</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hickey, Joseph</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Nucleation is the first step in the formation of a new phase in a thermodynamic system. The Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) is the traditional theory used to describe this phenomenon. The object of this thesis is to investigate nucleation beyond one of the most significant limitations of the CNT: the assumption that the surface tension of a nucleating cluster of the new phase is independent of the cluster’s size and has the same value that it would have in the bulk of the new phase. In order to accomplish this, we consider a microscopic, two-dimensional Lattice Gas Automata (LGA) model of precipitate nucleation in a supersaturated system, with model input parameters Ess (solid particle-to-solid particle bonding energy), Esw (solid particle-to-water particle bonding energy), η (next-to-nearest neighbour bonding coeffiicent in solid phase), and Cin (initial solute concentration). The LGA method was chosen for its advantages of easy implementation, low memory requirements, and fast computation speed. Analytical results for the system’s concentration and the crystal radius as functions of time are derived and the former is fit to the simulation data in order to determine the system’s equilibrium concentration. A mean first-passage time (MFPT) technique is used to obtain the nucleation rate and critical nucleus size from the simulation data. The nucleation rate and supersaturation are evaluated using a modification to the CNT that incorporates a two-dimensional, radius-dependent surface tension term. The Tolman parameter, δ, which controls the radius-dependence of the surface tension, decreases (increases) as a function of the magnitude of Ess (Esw), at fixed values of η and Esw (Ess). On the other hand, δ increases as η increases while Ess and Esw are held constant. The constant surface tension term of the CNT, Σ0, increases (decreases) with increasing magnitudes of Ess (Esw) fixed values of Esw (Ess), and increases as η is increased. Together, these results indicate an increase in the radius-dependent surface tension, Σ, with respect to increasing magnitude of Ess relative to the magnitude of Esw. Σ0 increases linearly as a function of the change in energy during an attachment or detachment reaction, |ΔE|, however with a slope less than that predicted for a crystal that is uniformly packed at maximum density.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Design, Synthesis and Magnetism of Single-molecule Magnets with Large Anisotropic Barriers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lin, Po-Heng</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis will present the synthesis, characterization and magnetic measurements of lanthanide complexes with varying nuclearities (Ln, Ln2, Ln3 and Ln4). EuIII, GdIII, TbIII, DyIII, HoIII and YbIII have been selected as the metal centers. Eight polydentate Schiff-base ligands have been synthesized with N- and mostly O-based coordination environments which chelate 7-, 8- or 9-coordinate lanthanide ions. The molecular structures were characterized by single crystal X-ray crystallography and the magnetic properties were measured using a SQUID magnetometer. Each chapter consists of crystal structures and magnetic measurements for complexes with the same nuclearity. There are eight DyIII SMMs in this thesis which are discrete molecules that act as magnets below a certain temperature called their blocking temperature. This phenomenon results from an appreciable spin ground state (S) as well as negative uni-axial anisotropy (D), both present in lanthanide ions owing to their f electron shell, generating an effective energy barrier for the reversal of the magnetization (Ueff). The ab initio calculations are also included for the SMMs with high anisotropic energy barriers to understand the mechanisms of slow magnetic relaxation in these systems.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>At the heart of high harmonic generation lies a combination of optical and collision physics entwined by a strong laser field. An electron, initially tunnel-ionized by the field, driven away then back in the continuum, finally recombines back to rest in its initial ground state via a radiative transition. The emitted attosecond (atto=10^-18) XUV light pulse carries all the information (polarization, amplitude and phase) about the photorecombination continuum-to-ground transition dipolar field. Photorecombination is related to the time-reversed photoionization process. In this perspective, high-harmonic spectroscopy extends well-established photoelectron spectroscopy, based on charged particle detection, to a fully coherent one, based on light characterization. The main achievement presented in this thesis is to use high harmonic generation to probe femtosecond (femto=10^-15) chemical dynamics for the first time. Thanks to the coherence imposed by the strong driving laser field, homodyne detection of attosecond pulses from excited molecules undergoing dynamics is achieved, the signal from unexcited molecules acting as the reference local oscillator. First, applying time-resolved high-harmonic spectroscopy to the photodissociation of a diatomic molecule, Br2 to Br + Br, allows us to follow the break of a chemical bond occurring in a few hundreds of femtoseconds. Second, extending it to a triatomic (NO2) lets us observe both the previously unseen (but predicted) early femtosecond conical intersection dynamics followed by the late picosecond statistical photodissociation taking place in the reaction NO2 to NO + O. Another important realization of this thesis is the development of a complementary technique to time-resolved high-harmonic spectroscopy called LAPIN, for Linked Attosecond Phase INterferometry. When combined together, time-resolved high-harmonic spectroscopy and LAPIN give access to the complex photorecombination dipole of aligned excited molecules. These achievements lay the basis for electron recollision tomographic imaging of a chemical reaction with unprecedented angstrom (1 angstrom= 0.1 nanometer) spatial resolution. Other contributions dedicated to the development of attosecond science and the generalization of high-harmonic spectroscopy as a novel, fully coherent molecular spectroscopy will also be presented in this thesis.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dispersion Characteristics of One-dimensional Photonic Band Gap Structures Composed of Metallic Inclusions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Khodami, Maryam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>An innovative approach for characterization of one dimensional Photonic Band Gap structures comprised of metallic inclusions (i.e. subwavelength dipole elements or resonant ring elements) is presented. Through an efficient S- to T-parameters conversion technique, a detailed analysis has been performed to investigate the variation of the dispersion characteristics of 1-D PBG structures as a function of the cell element configuration. Also, for the first time, the angular sensitivity of the structure has been studied in order to obtain the projected band diagrams for both TE and TM polarizations. Polarization sensitivity of the subwavelength cell element is exploited to propose a novel combination of elements which allows achieving PBGs with simultaneous frequency and polarization selectivity. The proposed approach demonstrates that the dispersion characteristic of each orthogonal polarization can be independently adjusted with dipole elements parallel to that same polarization. Generally, the structure has potential applications in orthomode transducer, and generally whenever the polarization of the incoming signal is to be used as a means of separating it from another signal in the same frequency band that is of orthogonal polarization. The current distribution and the resonance behavior of the ring element is studied and the effect of resonance on dispersion characteristics of 1-D PBGs composed of rings is investigated for the first time, for both individual and coupled rings. Interestingly, it is observed that 1-D PBG composed of resonant elements consistently has a bandgap around the resonant frequency of the single layer structure.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Comparison of Two Vortex-in-cell Schemes Implemented to a Three-dimensional Temporal Mixing Layer</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sadek, Nabel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Numerical simulations are presented for three dimensional viscous incompressible free shear flows. The numerical method is based on solving the vorticity equation using Vortex-In-Cell method. In this method, the vorticity field is discretized into a finite set of Lagrangian elements (particles) and the computational domain is covered by Eulerian mesh. Velocity field is computed on the mesh by solving Poisson equation. The solution proceeds in time by advecting the particles with the flow. Second order Adam-Bashford method is used for time integration. Exchange of information between Lagrangian particles and Eulerian grid is carried out using the M’4 interpolation scheme. The classical inviscid scheme is enhanced to account for stretching and viscous effects. For that matter, two schemes are used. The first one used periodic remeshing of the vortex particles along with fourth order finite difference approximation for the partial derivatives of the stretching and viscous terms. In the second scheme, derivatives are approximated by least squares polynomial. The novelty of this work is signified by using the moving least squares technique within the framework of the Vortex-in-Cell method and implementing it to a three dimensional temporal mixing layer. Comparisons of the mean flow and velocity statistics are made with experimental studies. The results confirm the validity of the present schemes. Both schemes also demonstrate capability to qualitatively capture significant flow scales, and allow gaining physical insight as to the development of instabilities and the formation of three dimensional vortex structures. The two schemes show acceptable low numerical diffusion as well.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Performance Characterization of Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) Corner Turning and Multimode Interference Devices</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zheng, Qi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology has become increasingly attractive because of the strong light confinement, which significantly reduces the footprint of the photonic components, and the possibility of monolithically integrating advanced photonic waveguide circuits with complex electronic circuits, which may reduce the cost of photonic integrated circuits by mass production. This thesis is dedicated to numerical simulation and experimental performance measurement of passive SOI waveguide devices. The thesis consists of two main parts. In the first part, SOI curved waveguide and corner turning mirror are studied. Propagation losses of the SOI waveguide devices are accurately measured using a Fabry-Perot interference method. Our measurements verify that the SOI corner turning mirror structures can not only significantly reduce the footprint size, but also reduce the access loss by replacing the curved sections in any SOI planar lightwave circuit systems. In the second part, an optical 90o hybrid based on 4 × 4 multimode interference (MMI) coupler is studied. Its quadrature phase behavior is verified by both numerical simulations and experimental measurements.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A 3-D Numerical Study of Flow, Coherent Structures and Mechanisms Leading to Scour in a High Curvature 135° Channel Bend with and Without Submerged Groynes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kashyap, Shalini</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis focused on investigating flow, coherent structures, and mechanisms leading to scour around a series of three submerged groynes in a high curvature (radius of curvature (R)/channel width (B)=1.5) channel bend using a Large Eddy Simulation Numerical (LES) model. Flow was investigated during both an initial and a later stage of scour. The results showed that the groynes appeared effective in keeping the main core of high streamwise velocity away from the outer bank wall in the region where they were installed, although high potential still existed for local scour around the groynes. During the initial stage of scour, horseshoe vortices (HVs) showed the greatest propensity to induce scour immediately upstream of the groyne tips. During the later stage of scour, the HV in front of the first upstream groyne (G1) induced very high mean pressure fluctuations on the outer bank wall. Scour was also of very great concern around the tip of G1 due to severe mean bed pressure fluctuations. Downstream of the groyne field, the presence of a counter-rotating outer bank cell was capable of endangering the stability of the outer bank. The second focus of this thesis was to investigate flow in a 135° channel bend using both Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) and LES numerical models. The RANS study examined the effects of curvature ratio (R/B), and aspect ratio (B/H, where H is the inlet flow depth), on secondary circulation strength, and bed shear stresses. The study revealed that a decrease in R/B was associated with an increase in secondary circulation strength and peak bed shear stress. A change in B/H also substantially affected cross stream circulation strength. The LES study was conducted in a 135° (R/B = 1.5) bend flume with a fixed bed corresponding to near equilibrium scour conditions, and the results were compared to a similar high curvature 193° bend numerical study. Inner bank vortices and shear layers were present in both cases although their characteristics were substantially different. Distributions of boundary friction velocities, and turbulence were also quite different for each case.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Characterization of Fiber Tapers for Fiber Devices and Sensors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wang, Xiaozhen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Fiber tapers have attracted much attention and have been successfully employed in various applications, ranging from resonators, filters, interferometers to sensors. This thesis studies the properties of fiber tapers for the purpose of making tapered-based devices and sensors in aerospace related application where small size and light weight are critical. This thesis includes theoretical derivation and experimental verifications of distributed mode coupling in tapered single-mode fibers (SMFs) with high-resolution optical frequency-domain reflectometry (OFDR) technique. The studies are realized with OFDR through phase detection of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), which measures local refractive index change relative to the reference arm. The wavelength shifts converted by the phase change give the group index differences between the fundamental mode and higher-order modes of fiber tapers. The energy re-distribution is observed in Rayleigh backscatter amplitude as a function of fiber length with a ~13µm resolution over the entire fiber taper, and group index difference between core and cladding modes is measured with a spatial resolution of ~2cm by using autocorrelation data processing. The thermal and mechanical properties of fiber tapers have also been characterized with OFDR. The cross-correlation wavelength shift is related to the refractive index change of the modes. It is shown that residual stress induced by the tapering process results in the inhomogeneous thermal property, which can be significantly reduced by an annealing treatment. A fiber taper with a waist diameter of ~6µm has a force sensitivity of ~620.83nm/N, ~500 times higher than that of SMF. Furthermore, polarization-preserving character of tapered polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) is evaluated by OFDR-based distributed birefringence along tapered PMFs. Three tapered-based micro-fiber devices have been used as effective mode selecting components to build narrow-linewidth tunable Erbium-doped fiber ring lasers. The fabrication is easy and at a low cost. 1) a tapered fiber tip forms multimode interference mechanism; 2) a two-taper MZI has been demonstrated by splitting/combining the fundamental mode and higher-order modes through fiber tapers and is tuned by bending one taper waist; 3) a novel tunable fiber Fabry-Perot filter, consisting of a hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber and a micro-fiber, is employed in the reflection mode.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Femtosecond Fiber Lasers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bock, Katherine J.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis focuses on research I have done on ytterbium-doped femtosecond fiber lasers. These lasers operate in the near infrared region, lasing at 1030 nm. This wavelength is particularly important in biomedical applications, which includes but is not limited to confocal microscopy and ablation for surgical incisions. Furthermore, fiber lasers are advantageous compared to solid state lasers in terms of their cost, form factor, and ease of use. Solid state lasers still dominate the market due to their comparatively high energy pulses. High energy pulse generation in fiber lasers is hindered by either optical wave breaking or by multipulsing. One of the main challenges for fiber lasers is to overcome these limitations to achieve high energy pulses. The motivation for the work done in this thesis is increasing the output pulse peak power and energy. The main idea of the work is that decreasing the nonlinearity that acts on the pulse inside the cavity will prevent optical wave breaking, and thus will generate higher energy pulses. By increasing the output energy, ytterbium-doped femtosecond fiber lasers can be competitive with solid state lasers which are used commonly in research. Although fiber lasers tend to lack the wavelength tuning ability of solid state lasers, many biomedical applications take advantage of the 1030 µm central wavelength of ytterbium-doped fiber lasers, so the major limiting factor of fiber lasers in this field is simply the output power. By increasing the output energy without resorting to external amplification, the cavity is optimized and cost can remain low and economical. During verification of the main idea, the cavity was examined for possible back-reflections and for components with narrow spectral bandwidths which may have contributed to the presence of multipulsing. Distinct cases of multipulsing, bound pulse and harmonic mode-locking, were observed and recorded as they may be of more interest in the future. The third-order dispersion contribution from the diffraction gratings inside the laser cavity was studied, as it was also considered to be an energy-limiting factor. No significant effect was found as a result of third-order dispersion; however, a region of operation was observed where two different pulse regimes were found at the same values of net cavity group velocity dispersion. Results verify the main idea and indicate that a long length of low-doped gain fiber is preferable to a shorter, more highly doped one. The low-doped fiber in an otherwise equivalent cavity allows the nonlinear phase shift to grow at a slower rate, which results in the pulse achieving a higher peak power before reaching the nonlinear phase shift threshold at which optical wave breaking occurs. For a range of net cavity group velocity dispersion values, the final result is that the low doped fiber generates pulses of approximately twice the value of energy of the highly-doped gain fiber. Two techniques of mode-locking cavities were investigated to achieve this result. The first cavity used NPE mode-locking which masked the results, and the second used a SESAM for mode-locking which gave clear results supporting the hypothesis.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical Modeling of Tsunami-induced Hydrodynamic Forces on Free-standing Structures Using the SPH Method</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>St-Germain, Philippe</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Tsunamis are among the most terrifying and complex physical phenomena potentially affecting almost all coastal regions of the Earth. Tsunami waves propagate in the ocean over thousands of kilometres away from their generating source at considerable speeds. Among several other tsunamis that occurred during the past decade, the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami in Japan, considered to be the deadliest and costliest natural disasters in the history of mankind, respectively, have hit wide stretches of densely populated coastal areas. During these major events, severe destruction of inland structures resulted from the action of extreme hydrodynamic forces induced by tsunami flooding. Subsequent field surveys in which researchers from the University of Ottawa participated ultimately revealed that, in contrast to seismic forces, such hydrodynamic forces are not taken into proper consideration when designing buildings for tsunami prone areas. In view of these limitations, a novel interdisciplinary hydraulic-structural engineering research program was initiated at the University of Ottawa, in cooperation with the Canadian Hydraulic Centre of the National Research Council, to help develop guidelines for the sound design of nearshore structures located in such areas. The present study aims to simulate the physical laboratory experiments performed within the aforementioned research program using a single-phase three-dimensional weakly compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical model. These experiments consist in the violent impact of rapidly advancing tsunami-like hydraulic bores with individual slender structural elements. Such bores are emulated based on the classic dam-break problem. The quantitatively compared measurements include the time-history of the net base horizontal force and of the pressure distribution acting on columns of square and circular cross-sections, as well as flow characteristics such as bore-front velocity and water surface elevation. Good agreement was obtained. Results show that the magnitude and duration of the impulsive force at initial bore impact depend on the degree of entrapped air in the bore-front. The latter was found to increase considerably if the bed of the experimental flume is covered with a thin water layer of even just a few millimetres. In order to avoid large fluctuations in the pressure field and to obtain accurate simulations of the hydrodynamic forces, a Riemann solver-based formulation of the SPH method is utilized. However, this formulation induces excessive numerical diffusion, as sudden and large water surface deformations, such as splashing at initial bore impact, are less accurately reproduced. To investigate this particular issue, the small-scale physical experiment of Kleefsman et al. (2005) is also considered and modeled. Lastly, taking full advantage of the validated numerical model to better understand the underlying flow dynamics, the influence of the experimental test geometry and of the bed condition (i.e. dry vs. wet) is investigated. Numerical results show that when a bore propagates over a wet bed, its front is both deeper and steeper and it also has a lower velocity compared to when it propagates over a dry bed. These differences significantly affect the pressure distributions and resulting hydrodynamic forces acting on impacted structures.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Vortex Methods for Fluid Simulation in Computer Graphics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Vines Neuwirth, Mauricio Alfredo</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Fluid simulations for computer graphics applications have attracted the attention of many researchers and practitioners due to the enhanced realism that natural phenomena simulation adds to graphical applications. Vortex methods are receiving increasing attention from the computer graphics community for simple and direct modeling of complex flow phenomena such as turbulence. However, vortex methods have not been developed yet to the level of other techniques for fluid simulation in computer graphics. In this work we present a novel simulation framework to model inviscid flows using Lagrangian vortex particle methods. We introduce novel stable methods to solve the vorticity flow equations that produce highly detailed visual fluid simulations. We incorporate the full interplay of solids and fluids in our framework. The coupling between free-form solids, represented by arbitrary surface meshes and fluids simulated with vortex methods, leads to visually rich simulations. Previous vortex simulators only focus on modeling the solid as a boundary for the flow. We model solid boundaries using an extended potential flow at the solid surface coupled with a boundary layer simulation. This allows the accurate simulation of two processes of visual interest. The first is the introduction of surface vorticity in the main flow as turbulence (vortex shedding). The second is the motion of the solid induced by fluid forces, which is calculated from the dynamics of vorticity in the flow and the rate of vorticity creation at solid surfaces. We demonstrate high quality results of our methods simulating flows around solid objects and solid object propulsion due to flows. This work ameliorates one of the important omissions in the development of vortex methods for computer graphics, which is the simulation of two-way coupling of solids and fluids.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Impact of Backreflections on Single-fiber Bidirectional Wavelength-Division-Multiplexing Passive Optical Networks (WDM-PONs)</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gao, Shiyu</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>With increased demand for bandwidth-hungry applications such as video-on-demand, wavelength-division-multiplexing passive optical network (WDM-PON) has become a strong contender in overcoming the last mile bottle neck. However, the wide-scale deployment of WDM-PONs has been delayed mainly due to the high cost of wavelength-specific optical components. To realize cost-effective WDM-PONs, various wavelength-independent, so called colorless architectures, have been developed so that all the subscribers can have identical optical network units (ONUs). In such WDM-PONs, however, single-fiber bidirectional transmission results in degradation of system performance caused by interference between the signals and backreflections. This thesis investigates the impact of backreflections on single-fiber bidirectional WDM-PONs. A WDM-PON with various optical line terminals (OLTs) and colorless ONU configurations is presented. The dependence of the power penalty, caused by backreflections, on a variety of parameters is investigated. This includes parameters such as the source linewidths, receiver bandwidth, transmission line loss (TLL), ONU gain, chirp effect at the ONU and optical return loss (ORL), in various WDM-PON configurations. The WDM-PON with continuous wave (CW) seed light and remodulation schemes are both presented and studied experimentally. The impacts of the backreflections on the single-fiber bidirectional WDM-PON with various OLT and ONU configurations are compared and analyzed accordingly.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Shock Instability in Gases Characterized by Inelastic Collisions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sirmas, Nick</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The current study addresses the stability of shock waves propagating through dissipative media, analogous to both granular media and molecular gases undergoing endothermic reactions. In order to investigate the stability, a simple molecular dynamics model was developed to observe shock waves and their structures with the inclusion of energy dissipation. For this, an Event Driven Molecular Dynamics model was implemented in a 2D environment, where a molecule is represented by a disk. The simulations addressed the formation of a shock wave in a gas by the sudden acceleration of a piston. Inelastic collisions were assumed to occur only if an impact velocity threshold is surpassed, representing the activation energy of the dissipative reactions. Parametric studies were conducted for this molecular model, by varying the strength of the shock wave, the activation threshold and the degree of inelasticity in the collisions. The resulting simulations showed that a shock structure does indeed become unstable with the presence of dissipative collisions. This instability manifests itself in the form of distinctive high density non-uniformities behind the shock wave, which take the form of convective rolls. The spacing and size of this ``finger-like" unstable pattern was shown to be dependent on the degree of inelasticity, the activation energy, and the strength of the driving piston. The mechanism responsible for the instability was addressed by studying the time evolution of the material undergoing the shock wave compression and further relaxation. It is found that the gas develops the instability on the same time scales as the clustering instability in homogeneous gases, first observed by Goldhirsch and Zanetti in granular gases. This confirmed that the clustering instability is the dominant mechanism.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Wave Loads on a Submerged Intake Structure in the Surf Zone</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hecimovich, Mark M.L.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Sea water intake structures submerged in the surf zone are used to provide water for cooling processes in large facilities such as power plants and refineries. Structures submerged in the surf zone are subject to large forces from breaking waves. To study these forces induced from realistic sea state conditions, a physical model of an intake structure submerged in the wave breaking zone was constructed and subjected to a wide spectrum of regular and irregular waves. The model structure was designed in a manner so force measurement could be isolated to separate components of the structure. The data of peak forces on the structure was analyzed for correlations with varying irregular wave properties. Using the results of forcing on the structure from regular wave tests, drag and inertia coefficients for use in the Morison equation were determined for each separate component and configuration of the structure. These force coefficients were plotted against various wave properties to analyze correlations with wave conditions. Finally, the force coefficients for the structure were used with the Morison equation and current data from the experiments to successfully model forcing on the structure during irregular wave tests.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Probing Collective Multi-electron Effects with Few Cycle Laser Pulses</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Shiner, Andrew</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>High Harmonic Generation (HHG) enables the production of bursts of coherent soft x-rays with attosecond pulse duration. This process arrises from the nonlinear interaction between intense infrared laser pulses and an ionizing gas medium. Soft x-ray photons are used for spectroscopy of inner-shell electron correlation and exchange processes, and the availability of attosecond pulse durations will enable these processes to be resolved on their natural time scales. The maximum or cutoff photon energy in HHG increases with both the intensity as well as the wavelength of the driving laser. It is highly desirable to increase the harmonic cutoff as this will allow for the generation of shorter attosecond pulses, as well as HHG spectroscopy of increasingly energetic electronic transitions. While the harmonic cutoff increases with laser wavelength, there is a corresponding decrease in harmonic yield. The first part of this thesis describes the experimental measurement of the wavelength scaling of HHG efficiency, which we report as lambda^(-6.3) in xenon, and lambda^(-6.5) in krypton. To increase the HHG cutoff, we have developed a 1.8 um source, with stable carrier envelope phase and a pulse duration of &lt;2 optical cycles. The 1.8 um wavelength allowed for a significant increase in the harmonic cutoff compared to equivalent 800 nm sources, while still maintaing reasonable harmonic yield. By focusing this source into neon we have produced 400 eV harmonics that extend into the x-ray water window. In addition to providing a source of photons for a secondary target, the HHG spectrum caries the signature of the electronic structure of the generating medium. In krypton we observed a Cooper minimum at 85 eV, showing that photoionization cross sections can be measured with HHG. Measurements in xenon lead to the first clear observation of electron correlation effects during HHG, which manifest as a broad peak in the HHG spectrum centred at 100 eV. This thesis also describes several improvements to the HHG experiment including the development of an ionization detector for measuring laser intensity, as well as an investigation into the role of laser mode quality on HHG phase matching and efficiency.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Steady State Response of Thin-walled Members Under Harmonic Forces</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mohammed Ali, Hjaji</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The steady state response of thin-walled members subjected to harmonic forces is investigated in the present study. The governing differential equations of motion and associated boundary conditions are derived from the Hamilton variational principle. The harmonic form of the applied forces is exploited to eliminate the need to discretize the problem in the time domain, resulting in computational efficiency. The formulation is based on a generalization of the Timoshenko-Vlasov beam theory and accounts for warping effects, shear deformation effects due to bending and non-uniform warping, translational and rotary inertial effects and captures flexural-torsional coupling arising in asymmetric cross-sections. Six of the resulting seven field equations are observed to be fully coupled for asymmetric cross-sections while the equation of longitudinal motion is observed to be uncoupled. Separate closed form solutions are provided for the cases of (i) doubly symmetric cross sections, (ii) monosymmetric cross-sections, and (iii) asymmetric cross-sections. The closed-form solutions are provided for cantilever and simply-supported boundary conditions. A family of shape functions is then developed based on the exact solution of the homogeneous field equations and then used to formulate a series of super-convergent finite beam elements. The resulting two-noded beam elements are shown to successfully capture the static and dynamic responses of thin-walled members. The finite elements developed involve no special discretization errors normally encountered in other finite element formulations and provide results in excellent agreement with those based on other established finite elements with a minimal number of degrees of freedom. The formulation is also capable to predict the natural frequencies and mode-shapes of the structural members. Comparisons with non-shear deformable beam solutions demonstrate the importance of shear deformation effects within short-span members subjected to harmonic loads with higher exciting frequencies. Comparisons with shell element solution results demonstrate that distortional effects are more pronounced in cantilevers with short spans. A generalized stress extraction scheme from the finite element formulation is then developed. Also, a generalization of the analysis procedure to accommodate multiple loads with distinct exciting frequencies is established. The study is concluded with design examples which illustrate the applicability of the formulation, in conjunction with established principles of fatigue design, in determining the fatigue life of steel members subjected to multiple harmonic forces.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Imaging Atoms and Molecules with Strong Laser Fields</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Smeenk, Christopher</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We study multi-photon ionization of rare gas atoms and small molecules by infrared femtosecond laser pulses. We demonstrate that ionization is accurately described by a tunnelling model when many infrared photons are absorbed. By measuring photo-electron and photo-ion spectra, we show how the sub-Ångstrom spatial resolution of tunnelling gives information about electron densities in the valence shell of atoms and molecules. The photo-electron and photo-ion momentum distributions are recorded with a velocity map imaging (VMI) spectrometer. We describe a tomographic method for imaging a 3-D momentum distribution of arbitrary symmetry using a 2-D VMI detector. We apply the method to measure the 3-D photo-electron distribution in elliptically polarized light. Using circularly polarized light, we show how the photo-electron momentum distribution can be used to measure the focused laser intensity with high precision. We demonstrate that the gradient of intensities present in a focused femtosecond pulse can be replaced by a single average intensity for a highly nonlinear process like multi-photon ionization. By studying photo-electron angular distributions over a range of laser parameters, we determine experimentally how the photon linear momentum is shared between the photo-electron, photo-ion and light field. We find the photo-electron carries only a portion of the total linear momentum absorbed. In addition we consider how angular momentum is shared in multi-photon ionization, and find the photo-electron receives all of the angular momentum absorbed. Our results demonstrate how optical and material properties influence the photo-electron spectrum in multi-photon ionization. These will have implications for molecular imaging using femtosecond laser pulses, and controlling the initial conditions of laser generated plasmas.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Photonic Generation of Microwave and Millimeter Wave Signals</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Li, Wangzhe</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Photonic generation of ultra-low phase noise and frequency-tunable microwave or millimeter-wave (mm-wave) signals has been a topic of interest in the last few years. Advanced photonic techniques, especially the recent advancement in photonic components, have enabled the generation of microwave and mm-wave signals at high frequencies with a large tunable range and ultra-low phase noise. In this thesis, techniques to generate microwave and mm-wave signals in the optical domain are investigated, with an emphasis on system architectures to achieve large frequency tunability and low phase noise. The thesis consists of two parts. In the first part, techniques to generate microwave and mm-wave signals based on microwave frequency multiplication are investigated. Microwave frequency multiplication can be realized in the optical domain based on external modulation using a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), but with limited multiplication factor. Microwave frequency multiplication based on external modulation using two cascaded MZMs to provide a larger multiplication factor has been proposed, but no generalized approach has been developed. In this thesis, a generalized approach to achieving microwave frequency multiplication using two cascaded MZMs is presented. A theoretical analysis leading to the operating conditions to achieve frequency quadrupling, sextupling or octupling is developed. The system performance in terms of phase noise, tunability and stability is investigated. To achieve microwave generation with a frequency multiplication factor (FMF) of 12, a technique based on a joint operation of polarization modulation, four-wave mixing and stimulated-Brillouin-scattering-assisted filtering is also proposed. The generation of a frequency-tunable mm-wave signal from 48 to 132 GHz is demonstrated. The proposed architecture can even potentially boost the FMF up to 24. In the second part, techniques to generate ultra-low phase noise and frequency-tunable microwave and mm-wave signals based on an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) are studied. The key component in an OEO to achieve low phase noise and large frequency-tunable operation is the microwave bandpass filter. In the thesis, we first develop a microwave photonic filter with an ultra-narrow passband and large tunability based on a phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating (PS-FBG). Then, an OEO incorporating such a microwave photonic filter is developed. The performance including the tunable range and phase noise is evaluated. To further increase the frequency tunable range, a technique to achieve microwave frequency multiplication in an OEO is proposed. An mm-wave signal with a tunable range more than 40 GHz is demonstrated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Rheological and Velocity Profile Measurements of Blood in Microflow Using Micro-particle Image Velocimetry</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pitts, Katie Lynn</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Microhemodynamics is the study of blood flow in small vessels, usually on the order of 50 to 100 µm. The in vitro study of blood flow in small channels is analogous to the in vivo study of the microcirculation. At this scale the Reynolds and Womersly numbers are significantly less than 1 and the viscous stress and pressure gradient are the main determinant of flow. Blood is a non-homogeneous, non-Newtonian fluid and this complex composition and behavior has a greater impact at the microscale. A key parameter is the shear stress at the wall, which is involved in many processes such as platelet activation, gas exchange, embryogenesis and angiogenesis. In order to measure the shear rate in these blood flows the velocity profile must be measured. The measured profile can be characterized by the maximum velocity, the flow rate, the shear rate at the wall, or a shape parameter reflecting the bluntness of the velocity profile. The technique of micro-particle image velocimetry (µPIV) was investigated to measure the velocity profiles of blood microflows. The material of the channel, the type of tracer particles, the camera used, and the choice in data processing were all validated to improve the overall accuracy of µPIV as a blood microflow measurement method. The knowledge gained through these experiments is of immediate interest to applications such as the design of lab-on-a-chip components for blood analysis, analysis of blood flow behavior, understanding the shear stress on blood in the microcirculation and blood substitute analysis. Polymer channels were fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) by soft lithography in a clean room. PDMS was chosen for ease of fabrication and biocompatibility. The contacting properties of saline, water, and blood with various polymer channel materials was measured. As PDMS is naturally hydrophilic, surface treatment options were explored. Oxygenated plasma treatment was found to be less beneficial for blood than for water. The choice of camera and tracer particles were validated. Generally, for in vivo studies, red blood cells (RBCs) are used as tracer particles for the µPIV method, while for in vitro studies, artificial fluorescent micro particles are added to the blood. It is demonstrated here that the use of RBCs as tracer particles creates a large depth of correlation (DOC), which can approach the size of vessel itself and decreases the accuracy of the method. Next, the accuracy of each method is compared directly. Pulsed images used in conjunction with fluorescing tracer particles are shown to give results closest to theoretical approximations. The effect of the various post-processing methods currently available were compared for accuracy and computation time. It was shown that changing the amount of overlap in the post-processing parameters affects the results by nearly 10%. Using the greatest amount of correlation window overlap with elongated windows aligned with the flow was shown to give the best results when coupled with a image pre-processing method previously published for microflows of water. Finally the developed method was applied to a relevant biomedical engineering problem: the evaluation of blood substitutes and blood viscosity modifiers. Alginate is a frequently used viscosity modifier which has many uses in industry, including biomedical applications. Here the effect of alginate on the blood rheology, i.e., the shape of the velocity profile and the maximum velocity of blood flow in microchannels, was investigated. Alginate was found to blunt the shape of the velocity profile while also decreasing the shear rate at the wall. Overall, the accuracy of µPIV measurements of blood flows has been improved by this thesis. The work presented here has extended the known methods and accuracy issues of blood flow measurements in µPIV, improved the understanding of the blood velocity profile behavior, and applied that knowledge and methods to interesting, relevant problems in biomedical and biofluids engineering.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Characterization of Bio-sensing Waveguides in CYTOP Operating with Long Range Surface Plasmon Polaritons (LRSPP’s)</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Khan, Asad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis report works on optically characterizing waveguide based biosensors consisting of thin, narrow Au stripes embedded in CYTOP. The devices were examined using an ever evolving and improving interrogation setup, variations of which are described in detail in this document. A number of changes were made to the setup configuration in order to reduce noise levels and increase efficiency and accuracy of acquired measurements. Waveguides of varying configurations (straight waveguides and Mach-Zehnder Interferometers with etched and cladded channels) are described and optically characterized. The characterization results of these devices are presented in this thesis. Bulk index measurements are carried out in order to determine a suitable bio-sensing solution with a refractive index matched to that of CYTOP. Step index measurements clearly distinguishing the introduction of sensing solutions of refractive indices varying from one another, are made available. Preliminary bio-sensing experiments involving detection of change in refractive index of sensing fluid as well as adlayer thickness with the introduction of analytes binding to the waveguide surface that has been functionalized with antibodies, using both straight and cladded waveguides with single mode outputs are studied.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Kheirkhah Gildeh, Hossein</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Liquid waste discharged from industrial outfalls is categorized into two major classes based on their density. One type is the effluent that has a higher density than that of the ambient water body. In this case, the discharged effluent has a tendency to sink as a negatively buoyant jet. The second type is the effluent that has a lower density than that of the ambient water body and is hence defined as a (positively) buoyant jet that causes the effluent to rise. Negatively/Positively buoyant jets are found in various civil and environmental engineering projects: discharges of desalination plants, discharges of cooling water from nuclear power plants turbines, mixing chambers, etc. This thesis investigated the mixing and dispersion characteristics of such jets numerically. In this thesis, mixing behavior of these jets is studied using a finite volume model (OpenFOAM). Various turbulence models have been applied in the numerical model to assess the accuracy of turbulence models in predicting the effluent discharges in submerged outfalls. Four Linear Eddy Viscosity Models (LEVMs) are used in the positively buoyant wall jet model for discharging of heated waste including: standard k-ε, RNG k-ε, realizable k-ε and SST k-ω turbulence models. It was found that RNG k-ε, and realizable k-ε turbulence models performed better among the four models chosen. Then, in the next step, numerical simulations of 30˚ and 45˚ inclined dense turbulent jets in stationary ambient water have been conducted. These two angles are examined in this study due to lower terminal rise height for 30˚ and 45˚, which is very important for discharges of effluent in shallow waters compared to higher angles. Five Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models are applied to evaluate the accuracy of CFD predictions. These models include two LEVMs: RNG k-ε, and realizable k-ε; one Nonlinear Eddy Viscosity Model (NLEVM): Nonlinear k-ε; and two Reynolds Stress Models (RSMs): LRR and Launder-Gibson. It has been observed that the LRR turbulence model as well as the realizable k-ε model predict the flow more accurately among the various turbulence models studied herein.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Properties of Self-assembled Quantum Dots Containing Magnetic Ions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Trojnar, Anna</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>There is currently interest in developing control over the spin of a single Manganese (Mn) ion, the atomic limit of magnetic memory, in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). In this work we present theoretical results showing how one can manipulate the spin of Mn ion with light in a QD by engineering Mn-multi-exciton interactions through quantum interference, design of exciton and bi-exciton states and application of the magnetic field. We develop a fully microscopic model of correlated exciton and bi-exciton interacting with the Mn ion. The electrons and heavy holes, confined in the QD, approximated as a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator (HO), interact via direct and short- and long-range exchange Coulomb interactions. The matrix elements of the exchange interaction are computed for the first time in the harmonic oscillator basis and for arbitrary magnetic fields. The exciton and bi-exciton energies and states are computed using the configuration interaction method. The interaction between carriers and the Mn spin is accounted for by the Heisenberg electron-Mn and Ising hole-Mn exchange interactions. For a single exciton confined in a magnetic dot, a novel quantum interference (QI) effect between the electron-hole Coulomb scattering and the scattering by Mn ion is obtained. The QI significantly affects the exciton-Mn coupling, modifying the splitting of the emission/absorption lines from the exciton-Mn complex depending on the degree of electronic correlations in the exciton state. The second signature of the QI are the nonuniform energy gaps between the consecutive emission peaks due to the scattering of carriers by Mn among single-particle orbitals. Magneto-photoluminescence experiments show that the coupling between the exciton and Mn ion does not change in the magnetic field. We report that electron-hole correlations counteract the magnetic squeezing of the single-particle wave functions strengthening the carrier-Mn interactions. As a result, the rate of change of the magneto-photoluminescence spectra with magnetic field is reduced as observed in the experiment. We develop here for the first time a microscopic theory of bi-exciton-Mn complex, and report the presence of the fine structure of bi-exciton-Mn complex, even though as a spin-singlet it is expected to decouple from the localized spin. Theoretical results are compared with experiments in Grenoble and Warsaw.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Study of the Instability and Dynamics of Detonation Waves using Fickett's Analogue to the Reactive Euler Equations</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tang, Justin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The instability behaviour of detonation waves are studied using Fickett's model with a 2-step reaction model with separately controlled induction and reaction zones. This model acts as a simplified toy-model to the reactive Euler equations allowing for more clarity of the detonation phenomenon. We numerically simulate a 1D self-supported detonation and investigate the pulsating instability behaviour. We are able to clarify the governing mechanism behind the pulsations through a characteristic analysis describing the coupling that takes place between the amplification of the compressions waves and the alteration to the induction timing. We examine the acceleration phase of the pulsations and determine an analytical solution to describe the strength of the amplification. Fickett's model is as well shown to reproduce the same period doubling bifurcation with increasing sensitivity of the induction rate, and route to chaos as seen in the full reactive Euler equations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An Aperture Synthesis Technique for Cylindrical Printed Lens/Transmitarray Antennas with Shaped Beams</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Biswas, Mahmud</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Printed lens antennas offer the possibility of realizing shaped beam patterns using no more complexity than is required for pencil beam patterns. Shaped beam patterns can be obtained by appropriately determining the complex transmission coefficient required for each cell (or element) of the printed lens, taking into account the varying feed field over the input surface of the lens. Certain ranges of transmission coefficient amplitude and phase are undesirable (eg. too low an amplitude implies a large reflection at the lens input surface). It would be preferable to constrain the range of values that the transmission coefficient can take as an integral part of the lens synthesis procedure, and thus the transmission coefficient itself needs to be the synthesis variable. In this thesis a synthesis technique for doing this is developed based on the method of generalized projections, modified to “operate” in the space of transmission coefficients. This makes it possible to immediately perceive what influence constraints on the actual transmission coefficients have on the possible radiation pattern performance. In addition, an approach that allows one to constrain the transmission coefficient to values that must be selected from an available database of transmission coefficients is incorporated into the synthesis technique.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering Miniaturized Microscope</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Smith, Brett</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Microscopy techniques have been developed and refined over multiple decades, but innovation around single photon modalities has slowed. The advancement of the utility of information acquired, and minimum resolution available is seemingly reaching an asymptote. The fusion of light microscopy and well-studied nonlinear processes has broken through this barrier and enabled the collection of vast amounts of additional information beyond the topographical information relayed by traditional microscopes. Through nonlinear imaging modalities, chemical information can also be extracted from tissue. Nonlinear microscopy also can beat the resolution limit caused by diffraction, and offers up three-dimensional capabilities. The power of nonlinear imaging has been demonstrated by countless research groups, solidifying it as a major player in biomedical imaging. The value of a nonlinear imaging system could be enhanced if a reduction in size would permit the insertion into bodily cavities, as has been demonstrated by linear imaging endoscopes. The miniaturization of single photon imaging devices has led to significant advancements in diagnostics and treatment in the medical field. Much more information can be extracted from a patient if the tissue can be imaged in vivo, a capability that traditional, bulky, table top microscopes cannot offer. The development of new technologies in optics has enabled the miniaturization of many critical components of standard microscopes. It is possible to combine nonlinear techniques with these miniaturized elements into a portable, hand held microscope that can be applied to various facets of the biomedical field. The research demonstrated in this thesis is based on the selection, testing and assembly of several miniaturized optical components for use as a nonlinear imaging device. This thesis is the first demonstration of a fibre delivered, microelectromechanical systems mirror with miniaturized optics housed in a portable, hand held package. Specifically, it is designed for coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, second harmonic generation, and two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging. Depending on the modality being exploited, different chemical information can be extracted from the sample being imaged. This miniaturized microscope can be applied to diagnostics and treatments of spinal cord diseases and injuries, atherosclerosis research, cancer tumour identification and a plethora of other biomedical applications. The device that will be revealed in the upcoming text is validated by demonstrating all designed-for nonlinear modalities, and later will be used to perform serialized imaging of myelin of a single specimen over time.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Optical Switch on a Chip: The Talbot Effect, Lüneburg Lenses &amp; Metamaterials</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hamdam, Nikkhah</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The goal of the research reported in this thesis is to establish the feasibility of a novel optical architecture for an optical route &amp; select circuit switch suitable for implementation as a photonic integrated circuit. The proposed architecture combines Optical Phased Array (OPA) switch elements implemented as multimode interference coupler based Generalised Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (GMZI) with a planar Lüneburg lens-based optical transpose interconnection network implemented using graded metamaterial waveguide slabs. The proposed switch is transparent to signal format and, in principle, can have zero excess insertion loss and scale to large port counts. These switches will enable the low-energy consumption high capacity communications network infrastructure needed to provide environmentally-friendly broadband access to all. The thesis first explains the importance of switch structures in optical communications networks and the difficulties of scaling to a large number of switch ports. The thesis then introduces the Talbot effect, i.e. the self-imaging of periodic field distributions in free space. It elaborates on a new approach to finding the phase relations between pairs of Talbot image planes at carefully selected positions. The free space Talbot effect is mapped to the waveguide Talbot effect which is fundamental to the operation of multimode interference couplers (MMI). Knowledge of the phase relation between the MMI ports is necessary to achieve correct operation of the GMZI OPA switch elements. An outline of the design procedures is given that can be applied to optimise the performance of MMI couplers and, as a consequence, the GMZI OPA switch elements. The Lüneburg Optical Transpose Interconnection System (LOTIS) is introduced as a potential solution to the problem of excessive insertion loss and cross-talk caused by the large number of crossovers in a switch fabric. Finally, the thesis explains how a Lüneburg lens may be implemented in a graded ‘metamaterial’, i.e. a composite material consisting of ‘atoms’ arranged on a regular lattice suspended in a host by nano-structuring of silicon waveguide slabs using a single etch-step. Furthermore, the propagation of light in graded almost-periodic structures is discussed. Detailed consideration is given to the calibration of the local homogenised effective index; in terms of the local parameters of the metamaterial microstructure in the plane and the corrections necessary to accommodate slab waveguide confinement in the normal to the plane. The concept and designs were verified by FDTD simulation. A 4×4 LOTIS structure showed correct routing of light with a low insertion loss of -0.25 dB and crosstalk of -24.12 dB. An -0.45 dB excess loss for 2D analysis and an -0.83 dB insertion excess loss for 3D analysis of two side by side metamaterial Lüneburg lenses with diameter of 15 μm was measured, which suggests that the metamaterial implementation produces minimal additional impairments to the switch.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental Investigation of Detonation Re-initiation Mechanisms Following a Mach Reflection of a Quenched Detonation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bhattacharjee, Rohit Ranjan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Detonation waves are supersonic combustion waves that have a multi-shock front structure followed by a spatially non-uniform reaction zone. During propagation, a de-coupled shock-flame complex is periodically re-initiated into an overdriven detonation following a transient Mach reflection process. Past researchers have identified mechanisms that can increase combustion rates and cause localized hot spot re-ignition behind the Mach shock. But due to the small length scales and stochastic behaviour of detonation waves, the important mechanisms that can lead to re-initiation into a detonation requires further clarification. If a detonation is allowed to diffract behind an obstacle, it can quench to form a de-coupled shock-flame complex and if allowed to form a Mach reflection, re-initiation of a detonation can occur. The use of this approach permits the study of re-initiation mechanisms reproducibly with relatively large length scales. The objective of this study is to experimentally elucidate the key mechanisms that can increase chemical reaction rates and sequentially lead to re-initiation of a de-coupled shock-flame complex into an overdriven detonation wave following a Mach reflection. All experiments were carried out in a thin rectangular channel using a stoichiometric mixture of oxy-methane. Three different types of obstacles were used - a half-cylinder, a roughness plate along with the half-cylinder and a full-cylinder. Schlieren visualization was achieved by using a Z-configuration setup, a high speed camera and a high intensity light source. Results indicate that forward jetting of the slip line behind the Mach stem can potentially increase combustion rates by entraining hot burned gas into unburned gas. Following ignition and jet entrainment, a detonation wave first appears along the Mach stem. The transverse wave can form a detonation wave due to rapid combustion of unburned gas which may be attributed to shock interaction with the unburned gas. Alternatively, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can produce vortices along the slipline that may lead to mixing between burned-unburned gases and potentially increase combustion rates near the transverse wave. However, the mechanism(s) that causes the transverse wave to re-initiate into a detonation wave remains to be satisfactorily resolved.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Howland, Matthew</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The general public is at risk of ionising-radiation exposure. The development of high-throughput methods to triage exposures is warranted. Current biodosimetry techniques are low-throughput and encumbered by time and technical expertise. Although there has been an emergence of gene-profiling tools for the purpose of photon biodosimetry, similar capacities do not exist for alpha-particle radiation. Herein is the first genomic study useful for alpha-particle radiation biodosimetric triage. This work has identified robust alpha-particle induced gene-based biomarkers in isolated, ex-vivo irradiated leukocytes from multiple donors. It was found that alpha-particle and photon radiation elicited similar transcriptional responses, which could potentially be distinguished by aggregate-signature analysis. Although no distinct genes were sole indicators of exposure type, clustering algorithms and principal component analysis were able to demarcate radiation type with some success. By comparing the biological effects elicited by photon and alpha-particle radiation, significant contributions have been made to the field of radiation biodosimetry.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Vesicle Deformation and Rupture in Confined Poiseuille Flow</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Harman, Alison</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Vesicles are simple structures, but display complex, non-linear dynamics in fluid flow. I investigate the deformation of nanometer-sized vesicles, both fully-inflated and those with excess area, as they travel in tightly confined capillaries. By varying both channel size and flow strength, I simulate vesicles as they transition from steady-state to unstable shapes, and then rupture in strong flow fields. By employing a molecular dynamics model of the vesicle, fluid, and capillary system one is able to rupture the lipid bilayer of these vesicles. This is unique in that most other numerical methods for modelling vesicles are unable to show rupture. The rupture of fully-inflated vesicles is applicable to drug delivery in which the release of the encapsulated medicine needs to be controlled. The deformation and rupture of vesicles with excess area could be applicable to red blood cells which have similar rheological properties.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Bandgap Engineering of Multi-Junction Solar Cells for Enhanced Performance Under Concentration</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Walker, Alexandre W.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This doctorate thesis focuses on investigating the parameter space involved in numerically modeling the bandgap engineering of a GaInP/InGaAs/Ge lattice matched multi-junction solar cell (MJSC) using InAs/InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) in the middle sub-cell. The simulation environment – TCAD Sentaurus – solves the semiconductor equations using finite element and finite difference methods throughout well-defined meshes in the device to simulate the optoelectronic behavior first for single junction solar cells and subsequently for MJSCs with and without quantum dots under concentrated illumination of up to 1000 suns’ equivalent intensity. The MJSC device models include appropriate quantum tunneling effects arising in the tunnel junctions which serve as transparent sub-cell interconnects. These tunneling models are calibrated to measurements of AlGaAs/GaAs and AlGaAs/AlGaAs tunnel junctions reaching tunneling peak current densities above 1000 A/cm^2. Self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are treated as an effective medium through a description of appropriate generation and recombination processes. The former includes analytical expressions for the absorption coefficient that amalgamates the contributions from the quantum dot, the InAs wetting layer (WL) and the bulk states. The latter includes radiative and non-radiative lifetimes with carrier capture and escape considerations from the confinement potentials of the QDs. The simulated external quantum efficiency was calibrated to a commercial device from Cyrium Technologies Inc., and required 130 layers of the QD effective medium to match the contribution from the QD ground state. The current – voltage simulations under standard testing conditions (1 kW/cm^2, T=298 K) demonstrated an efficiency of 29.1%, an absolute drop of 1.5% over a control structure. Although a 5% relative increase in photocurrent was observed, a 5% relative drop in open circuit voltage and an absolute drop of 3.4% in fill factor resulted from integrating lower bandgap nanostructures with shorter minority carrier lifetimes. However, these results are considered a worst case scenario since maximum capture and minimum escape rates are assumed for the effective medium model. Decreasing the band offsets demonstrated an absolute boost in efficiency of 0.5% over a control structure, thus outlining the potential benefits of using nanostructures in bandgap engineering MJSCs.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Conservation of Orbital Angular Momentum in High-Harmonic Generation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gariepy, Genevieve</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a property of light that is widely used for applications in bioimaging, optical communication and optical manipulation, but is mainly limited to the infrared and visible spectra. Developing a table-top source of Extreme Ultraviolet (XUV) light containing an arbitrary amount of OAM is yet to be achieved. We accomplish this by exploiting high-harmonic generation (HHG), a process whereby an infrared pump beam produces high order harmonics. We experimentally demonstrate the conservation of OAM in HHG by measuring harmonics of order n containing n times the OAM of the pump (n = 11, 13, 15 in our experiment). These results agree with our theoretical model. We also show theoretically how to manipulate the HHG process to impart an arbitrary amount of OAM to the di fferent harmonics. We hence show the way to a table-top and flexible source of XUV light containing orbital angular momentum.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An Appraisal of the Characteristic Modes of Composite Objects</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Alroughani, Hamad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The theory of electromagnetic characteristic modes was published roughly forty years ago, for both conducting and penetrable objects. However, while the characteristic mode analysis of conducting objects has found renewed interest as a tool for antenna designers, computed results for the characteristic mode eigenvalues, eigencurrents and eigenfields for penetrable objects have not appeared, not even in the seminal papers on the subject. In this thesis both volume and surface integral equation formulations are used to compute the characteristic modes of penetrable objects for what appears to be the first time. This opens the way for the use of characteristic mode theory in the design of antennas made of penetrable material whose polarization current densities constitute the main radiating mechanism of the antenna. Volume formulations are shown to be reliable but computationally burdensome. It is demonstrated that surface formulations are computationally more efficient, but obtrude some non-physical modes in addition to the physical ones. Fortunately, certain field orthogonality checklists can be used to provide a straightforward means of unambiguously selecting only the physical modes. The sub-structure characteristic mode concept is extended to problems involving both perfectly conducting and penetrable materials. It is also argued that sub-structure modes can be viewed as characteristic modes that implicitly use modified Green’s functions, but without such Green’s functions being needed explicitly. This makes the concept really practical, since the desired modified Green’s functions are not known explicitly in most cases.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Wavelength Reuse in UWB-Over-Fiber Networks</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cui, Wentao</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Wavelength reuse techniques for bidirectional ultra-wide band (UWB) over fiber (UWBoF) networks are presented. The downstream optical signal from the central station (CS) is reused for upstream data transmission with the original data erased at the base station (BS). Two wavelength reuse schemes for the generation of a clear optical carrier at the BS are theoretically analyzed and experimentally demonstrated. In the first scheme, the wavelength reuse is based on phase-modulation to intensity-modulation (PM-IM) conversion and destructive interferencing using a polarization modulator (PolM) and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG). A theoretical analysis is performed which is verified by an experiment. In the second scheme, the wavelength reuse is based on injection locking of a Fabry–Pérot laser diode (FP-LD) and polarization multiplexing. The UWB injection signal contributes to better BERs of both downstream and upstream services and a lower power penalty cause by the wavelength reuse of the whole system than the baseband signal. A bidirectional point-to-point transmission of over a 25-km single-mode fiber (SMF) using a single wavelength from the CS in each scheme is demonstrated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Studies in Applied and Fundamental Quantum Mechanics: Duality, Tomography, Cryptography and Holography</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bolduc, Eliot</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis encompasses a collection of four pieces of work on wave-particle duality, weak-value-assisted tomography, high-dimensional quantum key distribution, and phase-only holograms. In the work on duality, we derive a novel duality relation, and we sketch a thought experiment that leads to an apparent violation of the duality principle. In the project on tomography, we perform a state determination procedure with weak values, and we study the accuracy of the method. In the quantum cryptography project, we optimize an experimental implementation of a quantum cryptography system where two parties share information with the orbital angular momentum degree of freedom of entangled photon pairs. Finally, in the work on holography, we establish the exact solution to the encryption of a phase-only hologram, and experimentally demonstrate its application to spatial light modulators. The four projects provide improvements on measurement procedures in applied and fundamental quantum mechanics.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>On Inverse Problems for a Beam with Attachments</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mir Hosseini, Farhad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The problem of determining the eigenvalues of a vibrational system having multiple lumped attachments has been investigated extensively. However, most of the research conducted in this field focuses on determining the natural frequencies of the combined system assuming that the characteristics of the combined vibrational system are known (forward problem). A problem of great interest from the point of view of engineering design is the ability to impose certain frequencies on the vibrational system or to avoid certain frequencies by modifying the characteristics of the vibrational system (inverse problem). In this thesis, the effects of adding lumped masses to an Euler-Bernoulli beam on its frequencies and their corresponding mode shapes are investigated for simply-supported as well as fixed-free boundary conditions. This investigation paves the way for proposing a method to impose two frequencies on a system consisting of a beam and a lumped mass by determining the magnitude of the mass as well as its position along the beam.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Impulsive Differential Equations with Applications to Infectious Diseases</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Miron, Rachelle</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Impulsive differential equations are useful for modelling certain biological events. We present three biological applications showing the use of impulsive differential equations in real-world problems. We also look at the effects of stability on a reduced two-dimensional impulsive HIV system. The first application is a system describing HIV induction-maintenance therapy, which shows how the solution to an impulsive system is used in order to find biological results (adherence, etc). A second application is an HIV system describing the interaction between T-cells, virus and drugs. Stability of the system is determined for a fixed drug level in three specific regions: low, intermediate and high drug levels. Numerical simulations show the effects of varying drug levels on the stability of a system by including an impulse. We reduce these two models to a two-dimensional impulsive model. We show analytically the existence and uniqueness of T-periodic solutions, and show how stability changes when varying the immune response rate, the impulses and a certain nonlinear infection term. The third application shows how seasonal changes can be incorporated into an impulsive differential system of Rift Valley Fever, and looks at how stability may differ when impulses are included. The analysis of impulsive differential systems is crucial in developing more realistic mathematical models for infectious diseases.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental Investigations of Flow Development, Gap Instability and Gap Vortex Street Generation in Eccentric Annular Channels</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Choueiri, George H.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Isothermal flow development, gap instability, and gap vortex street generation in eccentric annular channels have been studied experimentally. A representative paradigm of a flow in a highly eccentric annular channel was examined for a channel having an inner-to-outer diameter ratio d/D = 0.50 and an eccentricity e = 0.8 for a Reynolds number Re = 7300. Observation of the flow development has identified three distinct regions: the entrance region, the fluctuation-growth region and the rapid-mixing region. Weak quasi-periodic velocity fluctuations were first detected in the downstream part of the entrance region, and grew into very strong ones, reaching peak-to-peak amplitudes in the narrow gap that were nearly 60% of the bulk velocity. The dependence on inlet conditions, d/D, e and Re on the development and structure of flows was also investigated. Experimental conditions covered the ranges: 0 ≤ Re ≤ 19000, 0 ≤ e ≤ 0.9 and d/D = 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75. For Re &lt; 7000, the Strouhal number, the normalized mid-gap axial flow velocity and the axial and cross-flow fluctuation intensities at mid-gap were found to increase with increasing Re and to depend strongly on inlet conditions. At higher Re, however, these parameters reached asymptotic values that were only mildly sensitive to inlet conditions. A map was constructed for the various stages of periodic motions vs. e and Re and it was found that, for e &lt; 0.5 or Re &lt; 1100, the flow was unconditionally stable as far as gap instability is concerned. For e ≤ 0.5, transition to turbulence occurred at Re ≈ 6000, whereas, for 0.6 ≤ e ≤ 0.9, the critical Reynolds number for the formation of periodic motions was found to increase with eccentricity from 1100 for e = 0.6 to 3800 for e = 0.9. The use of an empirically derived "mixing layer Strouhal number" permitted a universal description of gap vortex street periodicity in eccentric annular channels. This study has contributed to our understanding of the physical mechanisms that lead to gap instability and the development of a gap vortex street and the dependence of these flow phenomena on the channel geometry and the dynamic conditions of the flow.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Wing-tip Vortex Structure and Wandering</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pentelow, Steffen L.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>An isolated wing-tip vortex from a square-tipped NACA 0012 wing at an angle of attack of 5 degrees was studied in a water tunnel at a chord based Reynolds number of approximately 24000. Measurements were taken using stereo particle image velocimetry at three measurement planes downstream of the wing under each of three freestream turbulence conditions. The amplitude of wandering of the vortex axis increased with increasing distance downstream of the wing and with increasing freestream turbulence intensity. The magnitude of the peak azimuthal velocity decreased with increasing distance from the wing as well as with increases in the freestream turbulence intensity. The streamwise velocity in the vortex core was less than the freestream velocity in all cases. Time resolved histories of the instantaneous waveform shape and location of the vortex axis were determined from sequences of images of fluorescent dye released from the wing.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Effect of Inlet Temperature Non-Uniformity on High-Pressure Turbine Performance</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Smith, Craig I.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The temperature of the flow entering a high-pressure turbine stage is inherently non-uniform, as it is produced by several discrete, azimuthally-distributed combustors. In general, however, industrial simulations assume inlet temperature uniformity to simplify the preparation process and reduce computation time. The effects of a non-uniform inlet field on the performance of a commercial, transonic, single-stage, high-pressure, axial turbine with a curved inlet duct have been investigated numerically by performing URANS (Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations) simulations with the SST (Shear Stress Transport) turbulence model. By adjusting the alignment of the experimentally-based inlet temperature field with respect to the stator vanes, two clocking configurations were generated: a vane-impinging (VI) case , in which each hot streak impinged on a vane; and a mid-pitch (MP) case, in which each hot streak passed between two vanes. In the VI configuration, the hot streaks produced higher time-averaged heat load on the vanes and lower heat load on the blades. As the hot streaks in the VI case passed over the stator vanes, they also spread spanwise due to the actions of the casing passage vortices and the radial pressure gradient; this resulted in a stream entering the rotor with relatively low temperature variations. The hot streaks in the MP case were convected undisturbed past the relatively cool vane section. Relatively high time-averaged enthalpy values were found to occur on the pressure side of the blades in the MP configuration. The non-uniformity of the time-averaged enthalpy on the blade surfaces was lower in the VI configuration. The flow exiting the rotor section was much less non-uniform in the VI case, but differences in calculated efficiency were not significant. ; Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada, NSERC</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Amplification of Long-Range Surface Plasmon-Polaritons</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>De Leon Arizpe, Israel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Surface plasmon-polaritons are optical surface waves formed through the interaction of photons with free electrons at the surface of metals. They offer interesting applications in a broad range of scientific fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, and material science. However, many of such applications face limitations imposed by the high propagation losses of these waves at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, which result mainly from power dissipation in the metal. In principle, the propagation losses of surface plasmon-polaritons can be compensated through optical amplification. The objective of this thesis is to provide deeper insights on the physics of surface plasmon-polariton amplification and spontaneous emission in surface plasmon-polariton amplifiers through theoretical and experimental vehicles applied (but not necessarily restricted) to a particular plasmonic mode termed long-range surface plasmon-polariton. On the theoretical side, the objective is approached by developing a realistic theoretical model to describe the small-signal amplification of surface plasmon-polaritons in planar structures incorporating dipolar gain media such as organic dye molecules, rare-earth ions, and quantum dots. This model takes into account the inhomogeneous gain distribution formed near the metal surface due to a non-uniform excitation of dipoles and due to a position-dependent excited-state dipole lifetime that results from near-field interactions between the excited dipoles and the metal. Also, a theoretical model to describe the amplified spontaneous emission of surface plasmon-polaritons supported by planar metallic structures is developed. This model takes into account the different energy decay channels into which an exited dipole located in the vicinity of the metal can relax. The validity of this model is confirmed through experimentation. On the experimental side, the objective is approached by providing a direct experimental demonstration of complete loss compensation in a plasmonic waveguide. The experiments are conducted using the long-range surface plasmon-polariton supported by a symmetric thin gold waveguide incorporating optically pumped organic dye molecules in solution as the gain medium. Also, an experimental study of spontaneous emission in a long-range surface plasmon-polariton amplifier is presented. It is shown that this amplifier benefits from a low spontaneous emission into the amplified mode, which leads to an optical amplifier with low noise characteristics. The experimental setup and techniques are explained in detail.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Signal and Noise Time –domain Models for Microwave FETs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Asadi, Shahrooz</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Accurate characterization of active devices is one of the most crucial steps in efficient microwave circuit design. As the operating frequency increases, the dimensions of the electrodes of microwave transistors such as FETs become comparable to the wavelength, highlighting the parasitic effect of wave propagation and phase cancellation. Thus, this effect needs to be accurately evaluated in the device model to assure a reliable design. In this work, we proposed new small- and large-signal FET models for efficient millimeter-wave circuit design. In our approach, the device width was divided into an infinity number of segments, while each segment was considered as a combination of three coupled lines and a conventional FET equivalent circuit. By solving a set of multiconductor transmission line equations using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) technique, an accurate and efficient transistor modeling approach has been introduced. Furthermore, a new distributed noise FET model was proposed. It consists in a threecoupled excited transmission line (TL) structure in which the Laplace transformation was applied to determine the noise currents and voltages of lines. The structure was also analyzed by applying the Green's function concept as a wave approach. The proposed distributed mm-wave noise FET model has been demonstrated through successful comparison with measurements.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Analysis of Pipeline Systems Under Harmonic Forces</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Salahifar, Raydin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Starting with tensor calculus and the variational form of the Hamiltonian functional, a generalized theory is formulated for doubly curved thin shells. The formulation avoids geometric approximations commonly adopted in other formulations. The theory is then specialized for cylindrical and toroidal shells as special cases, both of interest in the modeling of straight and elbow segments of pipeline systems. Since the treatment avoids geometric approximations, the cylindrical shell theory is believed to be more accurate than others reported in the literature. By adopting a set of consistent geometric approximations, the present theory is shown to revert to the well known Flugge shell theory. Another set of consistent geometric approximations is shown to lead to the Donnell-Mushtari-Vlasov (DMV) theory. A general closed form solution of the theory is developed for cylinders under general harmonic loads. The solution is then used to formulate a family of exact shape functions which are subsequently used to formulate a super-convergent finite element. The formulation efficiently and accurately captures ovalization, warping, radial expansion, and other shell behavioural modes under general static or harmonic forces either in-phase or out-of-phase. Comparisons with shell solutions available in Abaqus demonstrate the validity of the formulation and the accuracy of its predictions. The generalized thin shell theory is then specialized for toroidal shells. Consistent sets of approximations lead to three simplified theories for toroidal shells. The first set of approximations has lead to a theory comparable to that of Sanders while the second set of approximation has lead to a theory nearly identical to the DMV theory for toroidal shells. A closed form solution is then obtained for the governing equation. Exact shape functions are then developed and subsequently used to formulate a finite element. Comparisons with Abaqus solutions show the validity of the formulation for short elbow segments under a variety of loading conditions. Because of their efficiency, the finite elements developed are particularly suited for the analysis of long pipeline systems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Phase Shifting Surface (PSS) and Phase and Amplitude Shifting Surface (PASS) for Microwave Applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gagnon, Nicolas</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis describes an electrically thin surface used for electromagnetic applications in the microwave regime. The surface is free-standing and its primary purpose is to modify the phase distribution, or the phase and amplitude distribution of electromagnetic fields propagating through it: it is called phase shifting surface (PSS) in the first case, and phase and amplitude shifting surface (PASS) in the second case. For practical applications, the surface typically comprises three or four layers of metallic patterns spaced by dielectric layers. The patterns of the metallic layers are designed to locally alter the phase (and amplitude in the case of the PASS) of an incoming wave to a prescribed set of desired values for the outgoing wave. The PSS/PASS takes advantage of the reactive coupling by closely spacing of the metallic layers, which results in a larger phase shift range while keeping the structure significantly thin. The PSS concept is used to design components such as gratings and lens antennas which are presented in this document. The components are designed for an operating frequency of 30 GHz. The PSS phase grating gives high diffraction efficiency, even higher than a dielectric phase grating. Several types of lens antennas are also presented, which show comparable performance to that of a conventional dielectric plano-hyperbolic lens antenna with similar parameters. The PASS concept is used in a beam shaping application in which a flat-topped beam antenna is designed. This work demonstrates the potential for realising thin, lightweight and low-cost antennas at Ka band, in particular for substituting higher-gain antenna technologies such as conventional dielectric shaped lens antennas.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Photoluminescence Spectroscopy of CdSe/Cd[0.5]Zn[0.5]S Core/Shell Colloidal Quantum Dots</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Brar, Jamie</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The photoluminescence (PL) of dense aggregates of CdSe/Cd0.5Zn0.5S core/shell colloidal quantum dots (cQDs) was investigated to gain insight into bleaching processes, quantum efficiency behaviour, band gap energy temperature dependence, and the phonon-coupling contribution to thermal broadening. This work also encompassed a study of various sample preparation techniques. These newly investigated strain-engineered core/shell cQDs, having an effective lattice constant in between that of CdS and ZnS, fosters the study of novel properties not present in the previous two systems. The bleaching behaviour, studied subject to strong optical pumping for different external cQD environments, showed effective shell passivation, thus limiting non-radiative processes mainly to the core or shell structures. The relative quantum efficiency was determined as a function of temperature, showing two distinct regimes, with activation of a phonon process above ~ 180 K. The band gap energy was found to follow the empirical Varshni relation describing the temperature dependence of a semiconductor material, dominating any thermally induced changes of the cQD volume and confinement potential. The PL spectral width change with temperature showed highly coupled carrier-phonon scattering behaviour.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Fully Customizable Anatomically Correct Model of the Crystalline Lens</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wilson, Cynthia Nicole</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The human eye is a complex optical system comprised of many components. The crystalline lens, an optical component with a gradient index (GRIN), is perhaps the least understood as it is situated inside the eye and as a result is difficult to characterize. Its complex nonlinear structure is not easily measured and consequently not easily modeled. Presently several models of the GRIN structure exist describing the average performance of crystalline lenses. These models, however, do not accurately describe the performance of crystalline lenses on an individual basis and a more accurate individual eye model based on anatomical parameters is needed. This thesis proposes an anatomically correct, individually customizable crystalline lens model. This is an important tool and is needed both for research on the optical properties of human eyes and to diagnose and plan the treatment of optically based visual problems, such as refractive surgery planning. The lens model consisted of an interior GRIN with a constant refractive index core. The anterior and posterior surface was described by conic sections. To realize this eye model, the optical and biometric properties of mammalian lenses were measured and the correlation relationships between these measurements were used to simplify the model down to one fitting parameter which controls the shape of the GRIN. Using this data, an anatomically correct individualizable model of the lens was successfully realized with varying parameters unique to each lens. Using this customizable lens model, customizable human eye models based on measurements of the entire human eye can be realized.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Role of Vorticity, Turbulence and Three-dimensional Flow Structure on the Development of Scour</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jamieson, Elizabeth Clare</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Fundamental to the understanding of how rivers transform and shape our environment is the role of turbulence and complex, three-dimensional flow, such as vorticity, in sediment transport and erosion. However, classical sediment transport models (or formulae) are based, for the most part, on boundary shear stress and do not incorporate these natural phenomena. This is understandable given that the relationship between turbulence generation, intensity and form; the influence of turbulence on mobile sediment; and the magnitude and patterns of deposition and erosion are complex and difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, the failure to incorporate turbulence and complex, three-dimensional flow into existing models means that our understanding of sediment transport remains incomplete. The central hypothesis of this thesis is that vortical motion is the main factor in the development of local scour. To examine this, a comprehensive experimental approach was taken. This approach involved detailed measurements of the unique three-dimensional patterns of velocity, turbulence and bed morphology associated with flow in an open channel with and without the presence of submerged groyne-like structures (stream barbs and wing dikes) at both the laboratory and field scales. Using densely spaced velocity data and new techniques for processing and analyzing these data, it was possible to identify complex features of the flow field at both scales, such as the presence of vortex cores, and correlate these with changes in bed levels. These data provide a unique perspective of the spatial variability of velocity, turbulence and bed morphology in open channels (and in particular in channel bends, where flow is highly three-dimensional). In particular, it was found that, of the flow parameters analyzed, turbulent stresses were most correlated to scour in channel bends without the presence of structures. In contrast, vorticity was found to be the dominant factor in local scour hole development in the vicinity of submerged structures at both the laboratory and field scale. Such data are rare (if non-existent) in existing experimental research, particularly at the scale of a large natural river. This research also examines stream barb design and performance. Stream barbs (also known as submerged groynes or spur dikes) are a relatively novel approach to stream bank protection and are not common in Canada. The design and installation of stream barbs in a creek in Ottawa (Sawmill Creek) was undertaken to serve as a demonstration project for the use of these structures in a semi-alluvial channel, for which no such case studies exist. Three years of monitoring the site and the performance of these structures to reduce bank erosion and improve aquatic habitat have been carried out. Laboratory testing of stream barb performance was also undertaken and showed that with improper design, the outer bank in a channel bend may be more susceptible to erosion due to excessive local scour downstream of the barb. In particular, to avoid bank erosion downstream of the barb, barbs should be small, such that they create minimum flow obstruction, and include a bank key that is wider than the barb itself and extends in the downstream direction.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>All-optical Microwave Signal Processing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Han, Yichen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Microwave signal processing in the optical domain is investigated in this thesis. Two signal processors including an all-optical fractional Hilbert transformer and an all-optical microwave differentiator are investigated and experimentally demonstrated. Specifically, the photonic-assisted fractional Hilbert transformer with tunable fractional order is implemented based on a temporal pulse shaping system incorporating a phase modulator. By applying a step function to the phase modulator to introduce a phase jump, a real-time fractional Hilbert transformer with a tunable fractional order is achieved. The microwave bandpass differentiator is implemented based on a finite impulse response (FIR) photonic microwave delay-line filter with nonuniformly-spaced taps. A microwave bandpass differentiator based on a six-tap nonuniformly-spaced photonic microwave delay-line filter with all- positive coefficients is designed, simulated, and experimentally demonstrated. The reconfigurability of the microwave bandpass differentiator is experimentally investigated. The employment of the differentiator to perform differentiation of a bandpass microwave signal is also experimentally demonstrated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Example-Based Fluid Simulation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chang, Ming</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We present a novel method for example-based simulation of fluid flow. We reconstruct fluid animation from physically based fluid simulation examples. Our framework shows how to decompose a given series of fluid motion example data into small units and then recompose them. We capture the properties of local fluid behavior by dicing the fluid motion example data into sequences of fragments, which have smaller volume and shorter length. We build a database out of these fragments, and propose a matching strategy to generate new fluid animation. To achieve highly efficient database query, we project our fragments onto lower dimensional subspace using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach, and construct our data structure as a kd-tree by treating each fragment as a point in this subspace. Our method has been implemented in synthesizing both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) fluid’s velocity fields.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Generation, Characterization and Application of the 3rd and 4th Harmonics of a Ti:sapphire Femtosecond Laser</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wright, Peter</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (fsTRPES) experiments have been used to study the photoelectron energy spectra of simple molecules since the 1980’s. Analysis of these spectra provides information about the ultrafast internal conversion dynamics of the parent ions. However, ultraviolet pulses must be used for these pump-probe experiments in order to ionize the molecules. Since current solid state lasers, such as the Ti:sapphire laser, typically produce pulses centered at 800nm, it is necessary to generate UV pulses with nonlinear frequency mixing techniques. I therefore constructed an optical setup to generate the 3rd and 4th harmonics, at 266.7nm and 200nm, respectively, of a Ti:sapphire (Ti:sa) chirped-pulse amplified (CPA) laser system that produces 35fs pulses centered at 800nm. Thin Beta-Barium Borate (β-BaB2O4 or BBO) crystals were chosen to achieve a compromise between short pulse durations and reasonable conversion efficiencies, since ultrashort pulses are quite susceptible to broadening from group velocity dispersion (GVD). Output energies of around 11μJ and 230nJ were measured for the 266.7nm and 200nm pulses, respectively. The transform limits of the 3rd and 4th harmonic pulse lengths were calculated from their measured spectral widths. We found that the 266.7nm bandwidth was large enough to support sub-30fs pulses, and due to cutting at the lower-wavelength end of the 200nm spectrum, we calculated an upper limit of 38fs. The pulses were compressed with pairs of CaF2 prisms to compensate for dispersion introduced by transmissive optics. Two-photon absorption (TPA) intensity autocorrelations revealed fully compressed pulse lengths of 36 ± 2 fs and 42 ± 4 fs for the 3rd and 4th harmonics, respectively.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Multinuclear Solid-State Magnetic Resonance Studies on ‘Exotic’ Quadrupolar Nuclei: Acquisition Methods, High-Order Effects, Quantum Chemical Computations, and NMR Crystallography</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Widdifield, Cory</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This dissertation attempts to extend the classes of halogen-containing systems which may be studied using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR). As line shape broadening due to the quadrupolar interaction (QI) scales inversely with the applied field, high-field magnet technology is indispensable for this research. Combining advanced radiofrequency pulse sequences with high-field wideline data acquisition allowed for the collection of very broad SSNMR signals of all quadrupolar halogen nuclei (i.e., 35/37Cl, 79/81Br and 127I) within a reasonable amount of experimental time. The initial systems for study were of the MX2 variety (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba; X = Cl, Br, I). In total, 9 anhydrous compounds were tested. The effects of hydrate formation were tested on 7 additional compounds. Systematic trends in the observed δiso values (and to a lesser extent, Ω and CQ) were found to be diagnostic of the extent of hydration in these materials. Resolving power was successfully tested using SrBr2, which possesses 4 magnetically unique sites. The composition of CaBr2•xH2O was convincingly determined using SSNMR data and the hydration trends noted above. The sensitivity of the QI to the local bonding environment (e.g., bond distance changes of less than 0.05 Å) was used to refine (when coupled with gauge-including projector augmented-wave density functional theory (GIPAW DFT) quantum chemical computations) the structure of MgBr2, and was used to correct prior NMR data for CaCl2 (earlier accounts had been performed upon a CaCl2 hydrate). During NMR data analysis of certain iodine-containing materials, it was found that standard fitting software (which uses perturbation theory) could not reproduce the observations. Proper analysis required the use of exact simulation software and allowed for the observation of high-order quadrupole-induced effects (HOQIE). This motivated further studies using rhenium-185/187 nuclei, where it was expected that HOQIE would be more dramatic. The observed rhenium SSNMR spectra possessed additional fine structure that had never been observed before experimentally, nor would be expected from currently-available perturbation theory analysis software. Lastly, preliminary results are shown where 127I SSNMR is used to study important supramolecular systems, and the composition of the popular synthetic reagent ‘GaI’ is elucidated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Origin of Wave Blocking for a Bistable Reaction-Diffusion Equation : A General Approach</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Roy, Christian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Mathematical models displaying travelling waves appear in a variety of domains. These waves are often faced with different kinds of perturbations. In some cases, these perturbations result in propagation failure, also known as wave-blocking. Wave-blocking has been studied in the case of several specific models, often with the help of numerical tools. In this thesis, we will display a technique that uses symmetry and a center manifold reduction to find a criterion which defines regions in parameter space where a wave will be blocked. We focus on waves with low velocity and small symmetry-breaking perturbations, which is where the blocking initiates; the organising center. The range of the tools used makes the technique easily generalizable to higher dimensions. In order to demonstrate this technique, we apply it to the bistable equation. This allows us to do calculations explicitly. As a result, we show that wave-blocking occurs inside a wedge originating from the organising center and derive an expression for this wedge to leading order. We verify our results with some numerical simulations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>QUANTUM PHASE TRANSITIONS AND TOPOLOGICAL ORDERS IN SPIN CHAINS AND LADDERS</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pandey, Toplal</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Dimerized antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains and ladders demonstrate quantum critical phase transition, the existence or absence of which is dependent on the dimerization and the dimerization pattern of the chain and the ladder, respectively. The gapped phases can not be distinguished by the conventional Landau long-range order parameters. However, they possess non-local topological string order parameters which can be used to classify different phases. We utilize the self-consistent free fermionic approximation and some standard results for exactly solved models to analytically calculate the string order parameters of dimerized spin chains. As a complement parameter the gapped phases possess the topological number, called the winding number and they are characterized by different integer values of the winding number. In order to calculate the string order parameters and winding numbers in dimerized spin chains and two-leg ladders we use analytical methods such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation, mean-field approximation, duality transformations, and some standard results available for the exactly 1D solve models. It is shown that the winding number provides the complementary framework to the string order parameter to characterize the topological gapped phases.</dc:description>

However, these experiments only tell us about neutrino mass di erences, and nothing about the absolute masses themselves. The observation of neutrinoless double-beta (0 ) decay, a hypothetical nuclear transition, would provide the rst absolute mass scale measurement of the neutrino outside of cosmology. This decay would imply the neutrino to be a Majorana particle, the rst fermion of its kind. 0 decay would also be the rst observation of lepton number violation. The Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) is currently searching for 0 decay in 136Xe with a half-life greater than 1025 years. EXO-200 is the rst experiment of the EXO physics program, which has observed twoneutrino double beta decay (2 ) in 136Xe for the rst time, with a half-life of 2:165 0:075 1021 years [1]. This is the longest measured half-life to date. EXO is now designing a 5-tonne scale detector, nEXO, to be sensitive to the inverted-scale hierarchy. Despite the careful selection of radiopure substances for the detector, the existence of trace levels of 222Rn is inevitable. One of the daughters of 222Rn, 214Bi, can emit photons at the Q-value for 0 decay, making it a critical background. This dissertation investigates the method of Rn removal from gaseous Xe through the use of a Cu wool trap.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Computational Studies of Engineered Defects in Colloidal Photonic Crystals</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lipkowitz, Nathan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis is an exploration of the properties of engineered defects in self-assembled photonic crystals, with particular attention paid to the complete band gap of the a-Si inverse opal. The potential of this metamaterial for optical signal processing in telecommunications is studied using a pair of complementary simulation techniques; one is a frequency-domain code, while the other is in the time domain. Calculations of photonic states associated with isolated point defects are performed, and their cavity modes, losses and field distributions are calculated. The equivalence of two classes of defects is demonstrated, and a robust, single-mode point defect microcavity is proposed. A linear defect waveguide, comprised of coupled chain of such point defects, is analyzed. Transmission around sharp bends is demonstrated, and some simple devices are considered. Several potential approaches to fabrication of the defects, the properties of various candidate materials, and more complex devices are discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Parallel Implicit Adaptive-mesh-refinement Scheme for Hypersonic Flows with an Equilibrium High-temperature Equation of State</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wood, Alistair Henry Cameron</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A parallel implicit adaptive-mesh-refinement scheme is proposed for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations as applied to two-dimensional steady-state hypersonic laminar flows in conjunction with an equilibrium high-temperature equation of state. A finite-volume discretization is applied to the governing equations. Limited piecewise-linear solution reconstruction and Riemann solvers (Roe and HLLE, both modified for a general equation of state) are used to evaluate the inviscid fluxes. The gradients in the viscous fluxes are calculated using diamond-path reconstruction. The system of non-linear algebraic equations resulting from the finite-volume discretization are solved using an inexact Newton method with GMRES to solve the update step of the Newton method. GMRES is preconditioned with Schwarz preconditioning with local block-fill incomplete lower-upper factorization. Multigrid and pseudo-transient continuation are used for startup. Numerical results, including flows at Mach numbers of 7.0, are discussed and demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the scheme.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Theoretical Roadmap for Optical Lithography of Photonic Band Gap Microchips</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chan, Timothy</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents designs and fabrication algorithms for 3D photonic band gap (PBG) material synthesis and embedded optical waveguide networks. These designs are suitable for large scale micro-fabrication using optical lithography methods. The first of these is a criss-crossing pore structure based on fabrication by direct photo-electrochemical etching in single-crystal silicon. We demonstrate that a modulation of the pore radius between pore crossing points leads to a moderately large PBG. We delineate a variety of PBG architectures amenable to fabrication by holographic lithography. In this technique, an optical interference pattern exposes a photo-sensitive material, leading to a template structure in the photoresist whose dielectric-air interface corresponds to an iso-intensity surface in the exposing interference pattern. We demonstrate PBG architectures obtainable from the interference patterns from four independent beams. The PBG materials may be fabricated by replicating the developed photoresist with established silicon replication methods. We identify optical beam configurations that optimize the intensity contrast in the photoresist. We describe the invention of a new approach to holographic lithography of PBG materials using the diffraction of light through a three-layer optical phase mask (OPM). We show how the diffraction-interference pattern resulting from single beam illumination of our OPM closely resembles a diamondlike architecture for suitable designs of the phase mask. It is suggested that OPML may both simplify and supercede all previous optical lithography approaches to PBG material synthesis. Finally, we demonstrate theoretically the creation of three-dimensional optical waveguide networks in holographically defined PBG materials. This requires the combination of direct laser writing (DLW) of lines of defects within the holographically-defined photoresist and the replication of the microchip template with a high refractive index semiconductor such as silicon. We demonstrate broad-band (100-200~nm), single-mode waveguiding in air, based on the light localization mechanism of the PBG as well as sharp waveguide bends in three-dimensions with minimal backscattering. This provides a basis for broadband 3D integrated optics in holographically defined optical microchips.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Propagation of Shear Waves Generated by a Finite-amplitude Ultrasound Radiation Force in a Viscoelastic Medium</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Giannoula, Alexia</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A primary purpose of elasticity imaging, commonly known as elastography, is to extract the viscoelastic properties of a medium (including soft tissue) from the displacement caused by a stress field. Dynamic elastography methods that use the acoustic radiation force of ultrasound have several advantages, such as, non-invasiveness, low cost, and ability to produce a highly localized force field. A method for remotely generating localized low frequency shear waves in soft tissue is investigated, by using the modulated radiation force resulting from two intersecting quasi-CW confocal ultrasound beams of slightly different frequencies. In contrast to most radiation force-based methods previously presented, such shear waves are narrowband rather than broadband. As they propagate within a viscoelastic medium, different frequency-dependent effects will not significantly affect their spectrum, thereby providing a means for measuring the shear attenuation and speed as a function of frequency. Furthermore, to improve the detection signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), increased acoustic pressure conditions may be needed, causing higher harmonics to be generated due to nonlinear propagation effects. Shear-wave propagation at harmonic modulation frequencies does not appear to have been previously discussed in the elastography literature. The properties of the narrowband shear wave propagation in soft tissue are studied by using the Voigt viscoelastic model and Green’s functions. In particular, the manner in which the characteristics of the viscoelastic medium affect their evolution under both low-amplitude (linear) and high-amplitude (nonlinear) source excitation and conditions that conform to human safety standards. It is shown that an exact solution of the viscoelastic Green’s function is needed to properly represent the propagation in higher-viscosity media, such as soft tissue, at frequencies much beyond a few hundred hertz. Methods for estimating the shear modulus and viscosity in viscoelastic media are developed based on both the fundamental and harmonic shear components.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Planar Lightwave Circuits Employing Coupled Waveguides in Aluminum Gallium Arsenide</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Iyer, Rajiv</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This dissertation addresses three research challenges in planar lightwave circuit (PLC) optical signal processing. 1. Dynamic localization, a relatively new class of quantum phenomena, has not been demonstrated in any system to date. To address this challenge, the quantum system was mapped to the optical domain using a set of curved, coupled PLC waveguides in aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs). The devices demonstrated, for the first time, exact dynamic localization in any system. These experiments motivate further mappings of quantum phenomena in the optical domain, leading toward the design of novel optical signal processing devices using these quantum-analog effects. 2. The PLC microresonator promises to reduce PLC device size and increase optical signal processing functionality. Microresonators in a parallel cascaded configuration, called "side coupled integrated spaced sequence of resonators" (SCISSORs), could offer very interesting dispersion compensation abilities, if a sufficient number of rings is present to produce fully formed "Bragg" gaps. To date, a SCISSOR with only three rings has been reported in a high-index material system. In this work, one, two, four and eight-ring SCISSORs were fabricated in AlGaAs. The eight-ring SCISSOR succeeded in producing fully formed Bragg peaks, and offers a platform to study interesting linear and nonlinear phenomena such as dispersion compensators and gap solitons. 3. PLCs are ideal candidates to satisfy the projected performance requirements of future microchip interconnects. In addition to data routing, these PLCs must provide over 100-bit switchable delays operating at ~ 1 Tbit/s. To date, no low loss optical device has met these requirements. To address this challenge, an ultrafast, low loss, switchable optically controllable delay line was fabricated in AlGaAs, capable of delaying 126 bits, with a bit-period of 1.5 ps. This successful demonstrator offers a practical solution for the incorporation of optics with microelectronics systems. The three aforementioned projects all employ, in their unique way, the coupling of light between PLC waveguides in AlGaAs. This central theme is explored in this dissertation in both its two- and multi-waveguide embodiments.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fabrication and Characterization of Waveguides in Potassium Gadolinium Tungstate</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Merchant, Clark Adrien</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis describes the fabrication and characterization of waveguides in the nonlinear, Raman-active optical crystal potassium gadolinium tungstate (KGW). Ion implantation and femtosecond laser writing techniques are used for the first time to fabricate waveguides in this material. The light ion implanted waveguides using hydrogen ions showed unexpected refractive index increases in the damage regions of approximately 0.3% of the nominal refractive index values for three of the four polarization orientations, with only the highest refractive index polarization exhibiting a refractive index decrease of approximately 0.2%. Waveguides fabricated using high-energy carbon, oxygen and fluorine ion irradiations resulted in strongly confining waveguides with wide amorphous damage regions. Carbon ion irradiation of KGW showed the most promise, with sharp step-like waveguides with a maximum refractive index change of delta-n=0.2 with excellent preservation of the Raman properties in the waveguide core. Microreflectivity measurements on the carbon ion irradiated sample revealed unexpected intermittent refractive index changes in the core region, a feature not detected using standard characterization techniques found in the literature. The oxygen ion irradiation of KGW also generated strongly confining waveguides with a maximum refractive index change of delta-n=0.17, however the Raman performance was shown to be reduced to less than 50% in the waveguide cores. Fluorine ion irradiations of KGW resulted in amorphous regions fabricated in the surface regions, offering promise for masking techniques for creating two-dimensional structures. The waveguides written using femtosecond laser writing processes were used to write buried channel waveguides using compressive stresses to form the waveguide. These waveguides exhibited low-losses down to to 2.0 dB/cm in the telecommunications spectrum, with high coupling efficiency to SMF fiber, and excellent Raman properties in the waveguide core. These channel waveguides also successfully showed SRS generation into the 1.8-1.9 \mu m infrared region using a high power picosecond pump source in the telecommunications band. The use of the microreflectivity and micro-Raman spectroscopy measurement techniques were demonstrated to be valuable characterization tools for each of the fabrication methods.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Point-based Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry Using Radiochromic Materials and a Fibreoptic Readout System</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rink, Alexandra</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Real-time feedback of absorbed dose at a point within a patient can help with radiological quality assurance and innovation. Two radiochromic materials from GafChromic MD-55 and EBT films have been investigated for applicability in real-time in vivo dosimetry of ionizing radiation. Both films were able to produce a real-time measurement of optical density from a small volume, allowing positioning onto a tip of an optical fibre in the future. The increase in optical density was linear with absorbed dose for MD-55, and non-linear for EBT. The non-linearity of EBT is associated with its increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation compared to MD-55, thus reaching optical saturation at a much lower dose. The radiochromic material in EBT film was also shown to polymerize and stabilize faster, decreasing dose rate dependence in real-time measurements in comparison to MD-55. The response of the two media was tested over 75 kVp – 18 MV range of x-ray beams. The optical density measured for EBT was constant within 3% throughout the entire range, while MD-55 exhibited a nearly 40% decrease at low energies. Both materials were also shown to be temperature sensitive, with the change in optical density generally decreasing when the temperature increased from ~22°C to ~37°C. This was accompanied by a shift in the peak absorbance wavelength. It was illustrated that some of this decrease can be corrected for by tracking the peak position and then multiplying the optical density by a correction factor based on the predicted temperature. Overall, the radiochromic material in GafChromic EBT film was found to be a better candidate for in vivo real-time dosimetry than the material in GafChromic MD-55. A novel mathematical model was proposed linking absorbance to physical parameters and processes of the radiochromic materials. The absorbance at every wavelength in the spectrum was represented as a sum of absorbances from multiple absorbers, where absorbance is characterized by its absorption coefficient, initiation constant, and polymerization constant. Preliminary fits of this model to experimental data assuming two absorbers suggested that there is a trade-off between EBT’s greater sensitivity and its dose linearity characteristics. This was confirmed by experimental results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Time and Frequency Evolution of the Precursors in Dispersive Media and their Applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Safian, Reza</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Until now, few rigorous studies of the precursors in structures exhibiting superluminal group velocities have been performed. One dimensional photonic crystals(1DPC) and active Lorentzian media are among the ones which are able to exhibit superluminal propagation. In the first part of the thesis we have studied the evolution of the precursors in active Lorentzian media and 1DPC. The problem of the propagation of the precursors in active Lorentzian media is addressed, by employing the steepest descent method to provide a detailed description of the propagation of the pulse inside the dispersive medium in the time domain. The problem of the time and frequency evolution of the precursors in 1DPC is studied, using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) techniques in conjunction with joint time-frequency analysis (JTFA). Our study clearly shows that the precursor fields associated with superluminal pulse propagation travel at subluminal speeds. It is also shown that FDTD analysis and JTFA can be combined to study the dynamic evolution of the transient and steady state pulse propagation in dispersive media. The second part of the thesis concentrates on the applications of the precursors. An interesting property of the precursors is their lower than exponential attenuation rate inside a lossy dielectric, such as water. This property of the precursors has made them an interesting candidate for applications such as ground penetrating radar and underwater communication. It was recently pointed out that a pulse which is generated inside of water and assumes the shape of the Brillouin precursor would be optimally suited for long range propagation in water (described by the single-pole Debye model). Here, we have considered the optimal pulse propagation problem, accounting for the interaction of the pulse with the air/water interface at oblique incidence. In addition, we argue that pulse excitations which are rough approximation of the Brillouin precursor will eventually evolve into the Brillouin precursor itself shortly after they enter water. Therefore, the excitation of a long-propagating pulse is not sensitive to its shape. Finally, we studied the performance of the optimized pulse in terms of the energy of the scattered field from an object inside water. Based on the simulation results the optimized pulse scattered field has higher energy compared to pulses with the same energy and different temporal distribution. The FDTD technique is employed in all the simulations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>High-speed Properties of 1.55-micron-wavelength Quantum Dot Semiconductor Amplifiers and Comparison with Higher-Dimensional Structures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zilkie, Aaron John</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis reports an experimental characterization of the ultrafast gain and refractive index dynamics of a novel InAs/InGaAsP/InP quantum-dot (QD) semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) operating near 1.55-µm wavelengths, assessing its high-speed performance characteristics for the first time. The thesis also studies the influence of the degree of quantum confinement on the dynamics of SOAs by comparing the zero-dimensional (0-D) QD's dynamics to those in 1-D InAs/InAlGaAs/InP quantum-dash (QDash), and 2-D InGaAsP/InGaAsP/InP quantum-well (QW) SOAs, both of which also operate near 1.55-µm wavelengths, and are made with matching or similar materials and structures. The ultrafast (around 1 ps) and long-lived (up to 2 ns) amplitude and phase dynamics of the SOAs are characterized via advanced heterodyne pump-probe measurements with 150-femtosecond resolution. It is found that the QD SOA has an 80-picosecond amplitude, and 110-picosecond phase recovery lifetime in the gain regime, 4-6 times faster than the QDash and QW recovery lifetimes, as well as reduced ultrafast transients, giving it the best properties for high-speed (&gt; 100 Gb/s) all-optical signal processing in the important telecommunications wavelength bands. An impulse response model is developed and used to analyze the dynamics, facilitating a comparison of the gain compression factors, time-resolved linewidth enhancement factors (alpha-factors), and instantaneous dynamic coefficients (two-photon absorption and nonlinear refractive-index coefficients) amongst the three structures. The quantum-dot device is found to have the lowest effective alpha-factor, 2-10, compared to 8-16 in the QW, as well as time-resolved alpha-factors lower than in the QW—promising for reduced-phase-transient operation at high bitrates. Significant differences in the alpha-factors of lasers with the same structure are found, due to the differences between gain changes that are induced optically or through the electrical bias. The relative contributions of stimulated transitions and free-carrier absorption to the total carrier heating dynamics in SOAs of varying dimensionality are also reported for the first time. Examining the QD electroluminescence and linear gain spectra in combination with the carrier dynamics also brings about conclusions on the nature of the quantum confinement, dot energy-level structure, and density of states—aspects of the material that have not been previously well understood.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Emergence of Unconventional Phases in Quantum Spin Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bernier, Jean-Sebastien</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, we investigate strongly correlated phenomena in quantum spin systems. In the first part of this work, we study geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets (AFMs). Generalizing the SU(2) Heisenberg Hamiltonian to Sp(N) symmetry, we obtain, in the large-N limit, the mean-field phase diagrams for the planar pyrochlore and cubic AFMs. We then use gauge theories to consider fluctuation effects about their respective mean-field configurations. We find, in addition to conventional Neel states, a plethora of novel magnetically disordered phases: two kinds of spin liquids, Z2 in 2+1D and U(1)in 3+1D, and several valence bond solids such as two and three-dimensional plaquette and columnar singlet states. We use the same approach to study the diamond lattice AFM which possesses extended classical ground state degeneracy. We demonstrate that quantum and entropic fluctuations lift this degeneracy in different ways. In the second part of the thesis, we study ultracold spinor atoms confined in optical lattices. We first demonstrate the feasibility of experimental realization of rotor models using ultracold spin-one Bose atoms in a spin-dependent and disordered optical lattice. We show that the ground state of such disordered rotor models with quadrupolar interactions can exhibit biaxial nematic ordering in the disorder-averaged sense, and suggest an imaging experiment to detect the biaxial nematicity in such systems. Finally, using variational wavefunction methods, we study the Mott phases and superfluid-insulator transition of spin-three bosons in an optical lattice with an anisotropic two dimensional optical trap. We chart out the phase diagrams for Mott states with n = 1 and n = 2 atoms per lattice site. We show that the long-range dipolar interaction stabilizes a state characterized by antiferromagnetic chains made of ferromagnetically aligned spins. We also obtain the mean-field phase boundary for the superfluid-insulator transition, and show that inside the superfluid phase and near the superfluid-insulator phase boundary, the system undergoes a first order antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic spin ordering transition.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantum and Classical Optics of Dispersive and Absorptive Structured Media</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bhat, Navin Andrew Rama</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents a Hamiltonian formulation of the electromagnetic fields in structured (inhomogeneous) media of arbitrary dimensionality, with arbitrary material dispersion and absorption consistent with causality. The method is based on an identification of the photonic component of the polariton modes of the system. Although the medium degrees of freedom are introduced in an oscillator model, only the macroscopic response of the medium appears in the derived eigenvalue equation for the polaritons. For both the discrete transparent-regime spectrum and the continuous absorptive-regime spectrum, standard codes for photonic modes in nonabsorptive systems can easily be leveraged to calculate polariton modes. Two applications of the theory are presented: pulse propagation and spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). In the propagation study, the dynamics of the nonfluctuating part of a classical-like pulse are expressed in terms of a Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a polariton effective field. The complex propagation parameters of that equation can be obtained from the same generalized dispersion surfaces typically used while neglecting absorption, without incurring additional computational complexity. As an example I characterize optical pulse propagation in an Au/MgF$_2$ metallodielectric stack, using the empirical response function, and elucidate the various roles of Bragg scattering, interband absorption and field expulsion. Further, I derive the Beer coefficient in causal structured media. The SPDC calculation is rigorous, captures the full 3D physics, and properly incorporates linear dispersion. I obtain an expression for the down-converted state, quantify pair-production properties, and characterize the scaling behavior of the SPDC energy. Dispersion affects the normalization of the polariton modes, and calculations of the down-conversion efficiency that neglect this can be off by 100$\%$ or more for common media regardless of geometry if the pump is near the band edge. Furthermore, I derive a 3D three-wave group velocity walkoff factor; due to the interplay of a topological property with a symmetry property, I show that even if down-conversion is into a narrow forward cone, neglect of the transverse walkoff can lead to an overestimate of the SPDC energy by orders of magnitude.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dissipation and Decoherence in Open Nonequilibrium Electronic Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Takei, So</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We theoretically study steady-state nonequilibrium properties of various open electronic systems subject to time-independent external bias. A charge current is established across each system by its coupling to two external particle reservoirs maintained at different chemical potentials. We discuss the impact of intra-reservoir electron correlations on transport, and examine how reservoir-generated dissipation and nonequilibrium-induced decoherence influence these systems. The effect of intra-lead electron interactions on transport is investigated in the context of a phonon-coupled single molecule transistor driven by Luttinger-liquid source and drain leads. The semi-classical master equation approach is used to compute current and noise characteristics of the device for various interaction strengths in the leads. The results suggest the possibility of tuning the Fano factor of the device using intra-lead electron interactions. The Keldysh path integral formalism is used to theoretically formulate models that describe the remaining open nonequilibrium systems. We consider voltage-induced electron-phonon scattering and electron mass enhancement due to phonons in a model metallic system. The possibility of adjusting the acoustic phonon velocity and the Thomas-Fermi screening length with external voltage is discussed. The effects of dissipation is investigated in an open BCS superconducting graphene, where the dissipation-induced rearrangement of its ground state from the BCS superconductor to the Fermi liquid is examined. The results theoretically infer prospects for a voltage-tuned metal-to-BCS quantum phase transition in graphene. Lastly, we develop a theory of nonequilibrium quantum criticality in open itinerant Ising and Heisenberg magnets. Both departures from equilibrium at conventional quantum critical points and the physics of phase transitions induced by the nonequilibrium drive are analyzed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Stereoscopic PIV In Steady Flow Through a Bileaflet Mechanical Heart Valve</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hutchison, Christopher</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The tendency of aortic bileaflet mechanical heart valves (BiMHVs) to promote thrombosis has been well documented in the literature. The relationship of thrombosis to valve fluid dynamics has prompted numerous studies of aortic BiMHV flow. In this study, steady flow was investigated downstream of a model Carbomedics No. 25 BiMHV in an axisymmetric aortic sinus using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV). The Reynolds number based on inlet diameter was 7600, and the measurement plane was perpendicular to the leaflet axes at the centerline of the aortic sinus. The typical formation of three jets was observed: the upper and lower lateral orifice jets, and the central jet. Flow separation from the valve ring was seen, and large scale vortices were identified in both the upper and lower sinus regions. An asymmetry in the reverse flow was found, and possible causes were discussed. All three jets were seen to decay similarly to free rectangular jets, with zero decay initially, followed by a 'linear' decay rate in which Umax^2~X. The central jet was also seen to be self similar in the linear decay region. Analysis of the out-of-plane velocity yielded two alternate explanations of streamwise vortex (i.e. Wx) structure, with either a four-cell or an eight-cell streamwise vortex structure being present in the mean velocity field. Organization of large scale three dimensional flow structures was thus apparent. Calculation of in-plane Reynolds stresses showed that values were highest in the outer shear layers of the lateral orifice jets. Elevated Reynolds shear stress values were also found in the leaflet wake regions, and the shear layers of the central jet.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nonlinear Multicontrast Microscopy for Structural and Dynamic Investigations of Myocytes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Greenhalgh, Catherine Ann</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Abstract: Nonlinear multicontrast microscopy is established in this study as an important tool for understanding biological structure and function of muscle cells. Second harmonic generation, third harmonic generation and multi-photon excitation fluorescence are acquired simultaneously in order to establish the origin of nonlinear signal generation in myocytes, and investigate myocyte structure and functionality during muscle contraction. Using structural cross-correlation image analysis, an algorithm developed specifically for this research, for the first time, third harmonic generation is shown to originate from the mitochondria in myocytes. The second harmonic, which is generated from the anisotropic bands of the sarcomeres, is further shown to be dependent on the crystalline order of the sarcomeres, thereby providing a potential diagnostic tool to evaluate disorder in muscle cells. The combination of the second and third harmonic provides complementary information that can be used to further elucidate the basic principles of muscle contraction. Time-lapse nonlinear microscopic imaging showed structural and functional dynamics in the myocytes. The second harmonic contrast revealed nonsynchronized nanocontractions of sarcomeres in relaxed, non-contracting, cardiomyocytes and Drosophila muscle samples, providing insight into the asynchronous behaviour of individual sarcomeres. Furthermore, macrocontracting samples were found to exhibit a synchronization of nanocontractions, providing new evidence for how muscles contract. Dynamic image correlation analysis, another algorithm developed specifically for this investigation, is used to reveal networks of mitochondria, which show fluctuations of multi-photon excitation fluorescence and third harmonic generation signals. The intensity fluctuations in the networks reveal both slow and fast dynamics; phase shifts of the slow dynamics between different networks are observed. Fast dynamics appear only in the inner networks, suggesting functional difference between interfibrillar and subsarcolemma mitochondria. The groundwork for studying bioenergetics of mitochondria in cardiomyocytes with nonlinear multimodal microscopy is fully developed in this work. The origin of the nonlinear signals and the development of the image analysis techniques provide a solid foundation to further study of muscle contractility and bioenergetics.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Subwavelength Focusing via Holographic Metallic Screens</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wong, Alex Man Hon</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this work we investigated a new class of subwavelength focusing device, termed the holographic metallic screen. We first proposed a generalized procedure which takes a holographic record of a subwavelength electromagnetic field distribution. Subsequently we synthesized this record using two types of holographic metallic screen – the slot antenna hologram (SAH) and the resonant slot antenna hologram (RSAH). We designed both holograms and evaluated their performances through full-wave simulations, and experimentally demonstrated subwavelength focusing for the RSAH. Simulations and experiments illustrated various attractive properties of the subwavelength focusing RSAH, which included (a) a tighter focal width than a single subwavelength aperture; (b) a focal field amplitude surpassing the incident field amplitude; and (c) a simple design scalable to a wide range of frequencies from microwave to optical. These properties should serve to motivate further development on the holographic metallic screen towards potential applications such as sensing, imaging and lithography.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Microwave Devices and Antennas Based on Negative-refractive-index Transmission-line Metamaterials</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Antoniades, Marc A.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Several microwave devices and antennas that are based on negative-refractive-index transmission-line (NRI-TL) metamaterials are presented in this thesis, which exhibit superior performance features compared to their conventional counterparts. These are a Wilkinson balun, a 1:4 series power divider, a four-element printed dipole array, a leaky-wave antenna, and an electrically small folded-monopole antenna. The Wilkinson balun employs +90° and −90° NRI-TL metamaterial lines at the output branches of a Wilkinson divider, to achieve a six-fold increase in the measured differential output phase bandwidth compared to that of an analogous balun employing transmission lines, while occupying only 55% of the area. The 1:4 series power divider comprises four non-radiating 0° NRI-TL metamaterial lines, each with a compact length of λ0/8, to provide equal power split to all four output ports. Compared to a conventional series power divider employing one-wavelength long transmission lines, the metamaterial divider provides a 154% increase in the measured through-power bandwidth, while occupying only 54% of the area. The metamaterial series power dividing concept is also applied to a four-element fully-printed dipole array that is designed to radiate at broadside, in order to demonstrate that the array exhibits reduced beam squinting characteristics. It is shown that the metamaterial-fed array has a measured scan-angle bandwidth that is 173% greater than an array that is fed using a conventional low-pass loaded line. The reduced-beam squinting property that NRI-TL metamaterial lines offer is subsequently exploited to create a leaky-wave antenna that radiates a near-fixed beam in the forward +45° direction, with an average measured beam squint of only 0.031°/MHz. This is achieved by operating the antenna in the upper right-handed band where the phase and group velocities are the closest to the speed of light. Finally, an electrically small antenna comprising four 0° NRI-TL metamaterial unit cells is presented which supports a predominantly even-mode current, thus enabling it to be modeled as a multi-arm folded monopole. This significantly increases its radiation resistance, which allows it to be matched to 50 Ω, while maintaining a high measured efficiency of 70%.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Diffractive Optics Near-field Laser Lithography for Fabrication of 3-dimensional Periodic Nanostructures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chanda, Debashis</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The main objective of the present research work is to fabricate three dimensional photonic nanostructures in photo-sensitive polymers using a novel diffractive optical element (DOE) based lithography technique. A diffractive optical element is a promising alternative device for 3D fabrication where one DOE creates multiple laser beams in various diffraction orders that are inherently phase-locked and stable for reproducible creation of 3D near-field diffraction patterns from a single laser beam. These near-field patterns are captured inside a photosensitive material like photoresist to fabricate 3D photonic crystal templates. We have demonstrated fabrication of a wide range of 3D structures having different crystal symmetries and different relative crystal axis ratios. The present work has provided 3D photonic crystal nanostructures with uniform optical and structural properties over large sample area (~3-4 mm diameter) and through large 15-50 micron thickness with large number of layers (&gt; 40) having period 550 nm - 650 nm and feature sizes between 200 nm and 300 nm. The short exposure time and small number of process steps shows promise for scaling to very large volume fabrication, dramatically improving the throughput, quality and structural uniformity of 3D periodic nanostructures, especially over that provided by tedious and costly semiconductor processing technology. The diffractive optics lithography is a parallel processing method that is easily scalable to generate centimeter-scale 3D nanostructures having large number of layers in several seconds. Due to low refractive index contrasts these polymer templates possess partial stopgaps along several crystallographic directions which can be practically used in several device or sensor applications where complete bandgap is not necessary. The potential usefulness of these partial stopbands for refractive index sensing of liquids has been demonstrated. These low refractive index polymer structures have been inverted with amorphous silica to convert a "soft" polymer structure to a robust "hard" structure. Further, few preliminary tests were done in fabricating 3D nanostructures into micro-fluidic channels for potential chromatography applications. The practical merits of this 3D fabrication technique will enable new practical manufacturing methods for optical and MEMS applications of 3D micro and nano structures.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Amplified Photochemistry with Slow Photons</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chen, Jennifer I-Ling</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Slow photon, or light with reduced group velocity, is a unique phenomenon found in photonic crystals that theoreticians have long suggested to be invaluable for increasing the efficiency of light-driven processes. This thesis demonstrates experimentally the feasibility of using slow photons to optically amplify photochemistry of both organic and inorganic systems. The effect of photonic properties on organic photochemistry was investigated by tracing out the wavelength-dependent rate of photoisomerization of azobenzene anchored on silica opals. The application of slow photons to inorganic photochemical processes was realized by molding nanocrystalline titania into an inverse opal structure and investigating its photodegradation efficiency in relation to the photonic properties. Changes in the photodegradation efficiency were directly linked to modifications of the electronic band gap absorption as a result of the photonic properties. The highest enhancement of twofold was achieved when the energy of the slow photons overlaps with the electronic band gap absorption, such that the loss of light due to photonic stop-band reflection was significantly reduced. In addition, the strength of slow-photon amplification with respect to the macroscopic structural order was studied by introducing controlled disorder via the incorporation of guest spheres into the opal templates. For the first time, a correlation between structural order, photonic properties and a photochemical process was established. The ability to combine slow-photon optical amplification with chemical enhancement was further achieved by incorporating platinum nanoparticles in inverse titania opals where the platinum nanoparticles increased the lifetimes of the higher population of electron-hole pairs arising from slow photon. Overall, various important factors governing the slow photon enhancement were investigated in detail, including the energy of the photonic stop band, angle dependence, thickness of the film, degree of structural order, filling fraction of the dielectric material and diffusion of a second medium if present. Theoretical calculations based on scalar-wave approximation in support of the experimental findings were provided wherever possible. The findings provide a blueprint for achieving optical amplification using slow photons in the broad range of photochemical or photophysical processes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>D-brane Chan-Paton Factors and Orientifolds</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gao, Dongfeng</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, we mainly study the structure of $D_9$-brane Chan-Paton factors in Type II orientifold $O_p^{\pm}$ theories. An explicit structure is found through a thorough and systematic derivation. For this purpose, we give a complete analysis of the worldsheet parity square action for all p-q open strings (i.e, the strings starting from $D_p$-branes and ending on $D_q$-branes), which is an extension of Gimon-Polchinski's work on the parity square action for p-q strings with $p-q$ even. We also formulate the rules for computing the scattering amplitudes of open strings ending on D-branes. These are important to build phenomenological models in string theory. As an application to the mathematical aspects of string theory, we confirm the proposal that the D-brane charges in Type II orientifolds are classified by the KR-theory groups. All these results will appear in our paper\footnote{Dongfeng Gao and Kentaro Hori, Clifford Algebras and Chan-Paton Factors, to appear.}. We also show some preliminary results on the B-type D-branes in the orientifolds of linear sigma models. A typical linear sigma model has both a geometric phase and a Landau-Ginzberg phase over its K\"ahler moduli space. The B-type D-branes are described by suitable categories in a linear sigma model and its phases. The orientifold projection induces parity mappings on the various categories. By looking at the transportation of invariant branes in the moduli space, we find the relations among the parity mappings of different phases in the quintic model.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Generation, Characterization and Applications of Femtosecond Electron Pulses</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hebeisen, Christoph Tobias</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Ultrafast electron diffraction is a novel pump-probe technique which aims to determine transient structures during photoinduced chemical reactions and other structural transitions. This technique provides structural information at the atomic level of inspection by using an electron pulse as a diffractive probe. The atomic motions of interest happen on the 100 fs = 10^(−13) s time scale. To observe these atomic motions, a probe which matches this time scale is required. In this thesis, I describe the development of an electron diffractometer which is capable of 200 fs temporal resolution while maintaining high signal level per electron pulse. This was made possible by the construction of an ultra-compact photoactivated 60 keV femtosecond electron gun. Traditional electron pulse characterization methods are unsuitable for high number density femtosecond electron pulses such as the pulses produced by this electron gun. I developed two techniques based on the laser ponderomotive force to reliably determine the duration of femtosecond electron pulses into the sub-100 fs range. These techniques produce a direct cross-correlation trace between the electron pulse and a laser pulse. The results of these measurements conﬁrmed the temporal resolution of the newly developed femtosecond electron diffractometer. This cross-correlation technique was also used to calibrate a method for the determination of the temporal overlap of electron and laser pulses. These techniques provide the pulse diagnostics necessary to utilize the temporal resolution provided by femtosecond electron pulses. Owing to their high charge-to-mass ratio, electrons are a sensitive probe for electric ﬁelds. I used femtosecond electron pulses in an electron deﬂectometry experiment to directly observe the transient charge distributions produced during femtosecond laser ablation of a silicon (100) surface. We found an electric ﬁeld strength of 3.5 × 10^6 V/m produced by the emission of 5.3 × 10^11 electrons/cm^2 just 3 ps after an excitation pulse of 5.6 J/cm^2 . This observation allowed us to rule out Coulomb explosion as the mechanism for ablation under the conditions present in this experiment.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Free-Space Metamaterial Superlenses Using Transmission-line Techniques</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Iyer, Ashwin K.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Free-space imaging with a resolution beyond that dictated by the classical diffraction limit may be achieved with a `Veselago-Pendry' superlens made from a metamaterial possessing a number of specific properties, including a negative refractive index (NRI). Although a planar NRI transmission-line (NRI-TL) metamaterial based on the periodic lumped loading of a host TL network has successfully verified the phenomenon of superlensing in a 2D microstrip environment, a true Veselago-Pendry superlens capable of interacting with and manipulating fields in free space remained elusive, largely due to the difficulty of meeting its stringent design constraints and also to the problem of realizing a full 3D isotropic, polarization-independent structure. This work presents the first experimental verification of free-space Veselago-Pendry superlensing using a new class of volumetric metamaterials based on 2D NRI-TL layers that, although polarization-specific, may be easily constructed using available lithographic techniques to interact with free-space sources. An equivalent-circuit model is developed to enable accurate design of the metamaterial's dispersion and transmission characteristics, including those associated with Veselago-Pendry superlensing, and is validated using full-wave simulations. First, a volumetric NRI-TL metamaterial employing fully printed loading elements is fabricated to verify the salient properties of a free-space metamaterial-slab lens. This lens demonstrates diffraction-limited focusing at X-band and, thus, affirms theoretical results that suggest that electrically thick and lossy metamaterials are unable to perform superlensing. Thereafter, a volumetric NRI-TL metamaterial based on discrete lumped elements is designed to meet the conditions of the Veselago-Pendry superlens at 2.40GHz, and experimentally demonstrates a resolution ability over three times better than that afforded by the classical diffraction limit. A microwave superlens designed in this fashion can be particularly useful for illumination and discrimination of closely spaced buried objects over practical distances by way of back-scattering, for example, in tumour or landmine detection, or for targeted irradiation over electrically small regions in tomography or hyperthermia applications. Possible optical implementations of the volumetric topology are also suggested, and finally, a fully isotropic, polarization-independent 3D metamaterial structure related to the volumetric NRI-TL structure is proposed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Symplectic and Subriemannian Geometry of Optimal Transport</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lee, Paul Woon Yin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis is devoted to subriemannian optimal transportation problems. In the first part of the thesis, we consider cost functions arising from very general optimal control costs. We prove the existence and uniqueness of an optimal map between two given measures under certain regularity and growth assumptions on the Lagrangian, absolute continuity of the measures with respect to the Lebesgue class, and, most importantly, the absence of sharp abnormal minimizers. In particular, this result is applicable in the case where the cost function is square of the subriemannian distance on a subriemannian manifold with a 2-generating distribution. This unifies and generalizes the corresponding Riemannian and subriemannian results of Brenier, McCann, Ambrosio-Rigot and Bernard-Buffoni. We also establish various properties of the optimal plan when abnormal minimizers are present. The second part of the thesis is devoted to the infinite-dimensional geometry of optimal transportation on a subriemannian manifold. We start by proving the following nonholonomic version of the classical Moser theorem: given a bracket-generating distribution on a connected compact manifold (possibly with boundary), two volume forms of equal total volume can be isotoped by the flow of a vector field tangent to this distribution. Next, we describe formal solutions of the corresponding subriemannian optimal transportation problem and present the Hamiltonian framework for both the Otto calculus and its subriemannian counterpart as infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian reductions on diffeomorphism groups. Finally, we define a subriemannian analog of the Wasserstein metric on the space of densities and prove that the subriemannian heat equation defines a gradient flow on the subriemannian Wasserstein space with the potential given by the Boltzmann relative entropy functional. Measure contraction property is one of the possible generalizations of Ricci curvature bound to more general metric measure spaces. In the third part of the thesis, we discuss when a three dimensional contact subriemannian manifold satisfies such property.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electronic States of Heavy Fermion Metals in High Magnetic Fields</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rourke, Patrick Michael Carl</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Heavy fermion metals often exhibit novel electronic states at low temperatures, due to competing interactions and energy scales. In order to characterize these states, precise determination of material electronic properties, such as the Fermi surface topology, is necessary. Magnetic field is a particularly powerful tool, since it can be used as both a tuning parameter and probe of the fundamental physics of heavy fermion compounds. In CePb3, I measured magnetoresistance and torque for 23 mK ≤ T ≤ 400 mK, 0 T ≤ H ≤ 18 T, and magnetic field rotated between the (100), (110), and (111) directions. For H||(111), my magnetoresistance results show a decreasing Fermi liquid temperature range near Hc, and a T^2 coefficient that diverges as A(H) ∝ |H −Hc|^−α, with Hc ~ 6 T and α ~ 1. The torque exhibits a complicated dependence on magnetic field strength and angle. By comparison to numerical spin models, I find that the “spin-flop” scenario previously thought to describe the physics of CePb3 does not provide a good explanation of the experimental results. Using novel data acquisition software that exceeds the capabilities of a traditional measurement set-up, I measured de Haas–van Alphen oscillations in YbRh2Si2 for 30 mK ≤ T ≤ 600 mK, 8 T ≤ H ≤ 16 T, and magnetic field rotated between the (100), (110), and (001) directions. The measured frequencies smoothly increase as the field is decreased through H0 ≈ 10 T. I compared my measurements to 4f-itinerant and 4f-localized electronic structure calculations, using a new algorithm for extracting quantum oscillation information from calculated band energies, and conclude that the Yb 4f quasi-hole remains itinerant over the entire measured field range, with the behaviour at H0 caused by a Fermi surface Lifshitz transition. My measurements are the first to directly track the Fermi surface of YbRh2Si2 across this field range, and rule out the 4f localization transition/crossover that was previously proposed to occur at H0.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Charge Transport in Self-assembled Nanoparticle-molecule Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zabet-Khosousi, Amir</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Charge transport in self-assembled gold nanoparticle (NP)-alkanedithiol (HS(CH2)nSH) systems are investigated using break-junctions. A remarkably simple and reproducible method to fabricate break-junctions using electromigration is described. Using the break-junctions, self-assembled NP systems are studied in two limits: (1) at the single-NP and (2) at the NP-array limits. Single-NP devices exhibit Coulomb-blockade (CB) conductance suppressions at low temperatures. Contrary to predictions of an Orthodox theory, temperature-dependence of conductance inside CB exhibits multiple activation energies (Ea): A small Ea at low temperatures, and a larger Ea at high temperatures. The small Ea is independent of NP size and is attributed to an energy state at the metal--molecule contact, whereas the larger Ea scales with NP size and is attributed to NPs' charging energy. Importantly, a significant (~5-100fold) discrepancy is observed between values of charging energies obtained from Ea and CB thresholds. To account for the discrepancy, a new model is proposed in which electrons can temporarily be localized at the energy states at the contacts and lose energy. The model is supported by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy which shows energy states close to Fermi level likely arising from gold-thiolate bonds. A suitably modified Orthodox theory can successfully explain the experimental observations. These results underscore the critical role of metal--molecule contacts in influencing energy-profiles of molecular junctions. Resistance-temperature dependencies of alkanedithiol-linked NP films show evidence of a metal-insulator transition (MIT) as n is varied. The MIT occurs at n = 5 and is explained in the context of a Mott-Hubbard model. Furthermore, all metallic films exhibit temperature coefficients of resistance that are smaller than that of bulk gold, and all insulating films exhibit a universal behavior, R ~ exp[(T0/T)^p], with p = 0.65. These observations are discussed in terms of temperature-independent elastic scattering and competitive thermally activated processes, respectively. The ability to tune properties of NP films thru an MIT implies that materials near the transition may be viewed as semiconductors. To explore this analogy, application of these materials in fabricating field-effect transistors is briefly described. These results highlight the utility of NP films as a platform for studying charge transport.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>High Speed Homodyne Detector for Gaussian-modulated Coherent-state Quantum Key Distribution</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chi, Yuemeng</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We developed a high speed homodyne detector in the telecommunication wavelength region for a Gaussian-modulated coherent-state quantum key distribution experiment. We are able to achieve a 100 MHz bandwidth, ultra-low electronic noise and pulse-resolved homodyne detector. The bandwidth of this homodyne detector has reached the same order of magnitude of the best homodyne detectors reported. By overcoming photodiode response functions mismatch, choosing proper laser sources, ensuring the homodyne detector linearity and stabilizing the homodyne detection system, we demonstrate that the homodyne detector has a 10 dB shot-noise-to-electronic-noise ratio in the time domain at a local oscillator of 5.4*10^8 photons/pulse at a laser repetition rate of 10 MHz. With this homodyne detector, we expect to ncrease our GMCS QKD experiment speed by 100 times, which will improve the key generation rate by 1-2 orders of magnitude.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Scattering of High-frequency Ultrasound by Individual Bound Microbubbles</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sprague, Michael</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Targeted imaging with microbubbles may resolve the molecular expression within the abnormal blood vessels of tumours. Optimal imaging requires understanding the interaction between targeted microbubbles and high-frequency ultrasound. Therefore, the subharmonic signal, and backscattering cross-section of individual bound microbubbles were examined with coaligned 30 MHz pulses and optical images. The peak subharmonic signal was generated for 1.6 µm diameter microbubbles for 20% and 11% bandwidth pulses and 1.8 µm for 45% bandwidth pulses at 200 kPa, consistent with estimations of the resonant size of microbubble's at 15 MHz. In order to measure the scattering cross-section, a new method was proposed to measure the receive transfer function of a transducer. Measurements of the backscattering cross-section scaled with the square of the radius, with signi cant size-independent variability. The results of this thesis will help optimise the parameters for targeted imaging, as well as further our understanding of the behaviour of microbubbles.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical Determination Of The Transition Boundary Between Regular and Mach Reflection For Planar Shocks Striking Wedges and Cones in Air</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Michalagas, Dean Andrew</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A numerical investigation of the interaction of a planar shock wave with a rigid wedge and cone in an air-filled shock tube is performed by computing the unsteady flow field of the interaction process. The Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are solved in two dimensions to produce flow solutions for regular and Mach reflections with and without the viscous and thermal boundary layer on the inclined surface. The transition boundary between these two patterns is determined by changing both the shock strength and the angle of the inclined surface so that the simulations are perpendicular to the theoretical transition boundary. The numerically determined boundaries are compared to the theoretical boundaries predicted by two- and three- shock theories and with results obtained from experiments. The results show that the transition boundary between regular and Mach reflection is different not only for wedges and cones but also for inviscid and viscous numerical solutions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Implantable Biosensors for Neural Imaging: A Study of Optical Modeling and Light Sources</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Munro, Elizabeth Alice</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We aim to develop an implantable, optical neural imaging device by fabricating lasers and photodiodes onto a gallium arsenide substrate. Some studies suggest that lasers exhibit higher noise than light emitting diodes (LEDs) due to coherence effects – my studies aim to quantify this noise and to guide device development. To this end, I developed a model of a fluorescent imaging device which agreed with experiment. Noise analysis performed in phantom showed that laser sources exhibit temporal and spatial noise up to 10x higher than LED sources, and in vivo noise analysis also demonstrated this trend. I studied a neural injury model called cortical spreading depression in vitro in mouse brain slices and in vivo in the rat brain using laser and LED sources. Signal magnitudes in vitro are on the order of 10% and in vivo results are inconclusive. Future work will aim to reduce coherence related noise.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Optical Properties of Magic-sized Nanocrystals: Absence of Inhomogeneous Line Broadening and Direct Evidence of Energy Transfer Between Two Magic Sizes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Nagy, Michelle</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Magic-sized nanocrystals (MSNs) are nanocrystals with a single size distribution. They have narrow spectral features that do not exhibit inhomogeneous line broadening. This enabled us to analyze homogeneous line broadening of CdSe and CdTe MSNs. In solution, we observed two aggregated configurations of CdSe and CdTe MSNs. Sub-peaks within MSN excitonic peaks were caused by these two aggregated configurations and surface states. A two-dimensional photoluminescence spectrum of a mixture of CdTe 427 nm and 500 nm MSNs gave direct evidence of Förster resonant energy transfer (RET) between the two sizes of MSNs. Normalized experimental overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorption spectra was on the order predicted by theory, confirming that there is sufficient overlap for RET to take place in this system. Additionally, within both aggregated configurations, the two sizes of MSNs were within sufficient distance from one another for RET to occur.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fermions and Bosons on an Atom Chip</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Extavour, Marcius H. T.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Ultra-cold dilute gases of neutral atoms are attractive candidates for creating controlled mesoscopic quantum systems. In particular, quantum degenerate gases of bosonic and fermionic atoms can be used to model the correlated many-body behaviour of Bose and Fermi condensed matter systems, and to study matter wave interference and coherence. This thesis describes the experimental realization and manipulation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of 87Rb and degenerate Fermi gases (DFGs) of 40K using static and dynamic magnetic atom chip traps. Atom chips are versatile modern tools used to manipulate atomic gases. The chips consist of micrometre-scale conductors supported by a planar insulating substrate, and can be used to create confining potentials for neutral atoms tens or hundreds of micrometres from the chip surface. We demonstrate for the first time that a DFG can be produced via sympathetic cooling with a BEC using a simple single-vacuum-chamber apparatus. The large 40K-87Rb collision rate afforded by the strongly confining atom chip potential permits rapid cooling of 40K to quantum degeneracy via sympathetic cooling with 87Rb. By studying 40K-87Rb cross-thermalization as a function of temperature, we observe the Ramsauer-Townsend reduction in the 40K-87Rb elastic scattering cross-section. We achieve DFG temperatures as low as T = 0.1TF , and observe Fermi pressure in the time-of-flight expansion of the gas. This thesis also describes the radio-frequency (RF) manipulation of trapped atoms to create dressed state double-well potentials for BEC and DFG.We demonstrate for the first time that RF-dressed potentials are species-selective, permitting the formation of simultaneous 87Rb double-well and 40K single-well potentials using a 40K-87Rb mixture. We also develop tools to measure fluctuations of the relative atom number and relative phase of a dynamically split 87Rb BEC. In particular, we observe atom number fluctuations at the shot-noise level using time-of-flight absorption imaging. These measurement tools lay the foundation for future investigations of number squeezing and matter wave coherence in BEC and DFG systems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical Experiments in Core-collapse Supernova Hydrodynamics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Fernandez, Rodrigo A.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The explosion of massive stars involves the formation of a shock wave. In stars that develop iron cores, this shock wave stalls on its way out due to neutrino emission and the breakup of heavy nuclei flowing through the shock. For the explosion to succeed, a fraction of the gravitational binding energy of the collapsed core that is radiated in neutrinos needs to be absorbed by the material below the shock. How much energy is needed depends on the interplay between non-spherical hydrodynamic instabilities, neutrino heating, and nuclear dissociation. This thesis seeks to understand this interplay through numerical experiments that model the key physical components of the system and separate them out to examine their individual effects. Specifically, one- and two-dimensional time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations are performed to study the effects of non-spherical shock oscillations, neutrino-driven convection, and alpha particle recombination on the dynamics of the system and the critical heating rate for explosion. We find that nuclear dissociation has a significant effect on the linear stability and saturation amplitude of shock oscillations. At the critical neutrino heating rate for an explosion, convection due to a negative entropy gradient plays a major role in driving dipolar shock motions. One dimensional explosions are due to a global instability involving the advection of entropy perturbations from the shock to the region where the accretion flow cools due to neutrino emission. Large scale shock expansions in two-dimensions are due to a finite amplitude instability involving the balance between buoyancy forces and the ram pressure of the flow upstream of the shock. During these expansions, a significant amount of energy is released when nucleons recombine into alpha particles, constituting a significant last step in the transition to explosion. The critical neutrino heating rate for an explosion depends sensitively on the starting radius of the shock relative to the radius at which the binding energy of an alpha particle is comparable to the gravitational binding energy.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Energy and Momentum Consistency in Subgrid-scale Parameterization for Climate Models</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Shaw, Tiffany A.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis examines the importance of energy and momentum consistency in subgrid-scale parameterization for climate models. It is divided into two parts according to the two aspects of the problem that are investigated, namely the importance of momentum conservation alone and the consistency between energy and momentum conservation. The first part addresses the importance of momentum conservation alone. Using a zonally-symmetric model, it is shown that violating momentum conservation in the parameterization of gravity wave drag leads to large errors and non-robustness of the response to an imposed radiative perturbation in the middle atmosphere. Using the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model, a three-dimensional climate model, it is shown that violating momentum conservation, by allowing gravity wave momentum flux to escape through the model lid, leads to large errors in the mean climate when the model lid is placed at 10 hPa. When the model lid is placed at 0.001 hPa the errors due to nonconservation are minimal. When the 10 hPa climate is perturbed by idealized ozone depletion in the southern hemisphere, nonconservation is found to significantly alter the polar temperature and surface responses. Overall, momentum conservation ensures a better agreement between the 10 hPa and the 0.001 hPa climates. The second part addresses the self-consistency of energy and momentum conservation. Using Hamiltonian geophysical fluid dynamics, pseudoenergy and pseudomomentum wave-activity conservation laws are derived for the subgrid-scale dynamics. Noether’s theorem is used to derive a relationship between the wave-activity fluxes, which represents a generalization of the first Eliassen-Palm theorem. Using multiple scale asymptotics a theoretical framework for subgrid-scale parameterization is built which consistently conserves both energy and momentum and respects the second law of thermodynamics. The framework couples a hydrostatic resolved-scale flow to a non-hydrostatic subgrid-scale flow. The transfers of energy and momentum between the two scales are understood using the subgrid-scale wave-activity conservation laws, whose relationships with the resolved-scale dynamics represent generalized non-acceleration theorems. The derived relationship between the wave-activity fluxes — which represents a generalization of the second Eliassen-Palm theorem — is key to ensuring consistency between energy and momentum conservation. The framework includes a consistent formulation of heating and entropy production due to kinetic energy dissipation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Optical and Material Properties of Colloidal Semiconductor Nanocrystals</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Huxter, Vanessa</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents an exploration of the photophysics of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals using both linear and non-linear optical measurement techniques. These optical methodologies are used to follow population dynamics in both singly and multiply excited nanocrystal systems as well as determine material properties of the ensemble. Topics covered in the thesis include, the identification and characterization of bulk-like nanocrystals, study of the fine structure states of the lowest energy exciton, single and multiexciton population dynamics, acoustic phonon modes, elasticity and surface stress properties of a colloidal ensemble in solution.Through linear spectroscopy, the properties of both quantum confined and bulk-like colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are compared. The identification of a model system of bulk-like nanocrystals with a non-standard absorption profile serves to resolve an ambiguity in literature concerning their characterization. The remainder of the thesis is focused on the size-dependent properties of quantum confined CdSe colloidal nanocrystals. The population dynamics and material properties of these systems are studied using a nonlinear optical technique called transient grating. A third order transient grating measurement with a cross-polarized configuration, which follows the relaxation within the fine structure levels of the lowest energy exciton state, is demonstrated and used to compare systems with different crystal field splittings. Transient grating experiments performed with specific polarization sequences allow for selective observation of the dynamics amongst nearly degenerate levels at room temperature. Cross-polarized transient grating is also used to observe a quantized acoustic phonon mode in a series of nanocrystal samples. The observation of this mode allows experimental determination of the elasticity and surface stress of the nanocrystal ensemble in solution. The anisotropic origin of the acoustic phonon is discussed using a combination of theoretical analysis, modelling and experimental data. In addition, third- and fifth-order transient grating experiments are used to study exciton and multiexciton population relaxation dynamics. The work presented here spans the optical and material properties of quantum confined and `bulk' nanocrystals. This thesis attempts to illustrate the broad scope of the observed behaviour of colloidal nanocrystal systems and to contribute to a greater understanding of their physical properties.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantum Theory of Phonon-mediated Decoherence and Relaxation of Two-level Systems in a Structured Electromagnetic Reservoir</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Roy, Chiranjeeb</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis we study the role of nonradiative degrees of freedom on quantum optical properties of mesoscopic quantum dots placed in the structured electromagnetic reservoir of a photonic crystal. We derive a quantum theory of the role of acoustic and optical phonons in modifying the optical absorption lineshape, polarization dynamics, and population dynamics of a two-level atom (quantum dot) in the ``colored" electromagnetic vacuum of a photonic band gap (PBG) material. This is based on a microscopic Hamiltonian describing both radiative and vibrational processes quantum mechanically. Phonon sidebands in an ordinary electromagnetic reservoir are recaptured in a simple model of optical phonons using a mean-field factorization of the atomic and lattice displacement operators. Our formalism is then used to treat the non-Markovian dynamics of the same system within the structured electromagnetic density of states of a photonic crystal. We elucidate the extent to which phonon-assisted decay limits the lifetime of a single photon-atom bound state and derive the modified spontaneous emission dynamics due to coupling to various phonon baths. We demonstrate that coherent interaction with undamped phonons can lead to enhanced lifetime of a photon-atom bound state in a PBG by (i) dephasing and reducing the transition electric dipole moment of the atom and (ii) reducing the quantum mechanical overlap of the state vectors of the excited and ground state (polaronic shift). This results in reduction of the steady-state atomic polarization but an increase in the fractionalized upper state population in the photon-atom bound state. We demonstrate, on the other hand, that the lifetime of the photon-atom bound state in a PBG is limited by the lifetime of phonons due to lattice anharmonicities (break-up of phonons into lower energy phonons) and purely nonradiative decay. We demonstrate how these additional damping effects limit the extent of the polaronic (Franck-Condon) shift of the atomic excited state. We also derive the modified polarization decay and dephasing rates in the presence of such damping. This leads to a microscopic, quantum theory of the optical absorption lineshapes. Our model and formalism provide a starting point for describing dephasing and relaxation in the presence of external coherent fields and multiple quantum dot interactions in electromagnetic reservoirs with radiative memory effects.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Development of a Flat Panel Detector with Avalanche Gain for Interventional Radiology</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wronski, Maciej</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A number of interventional procedures such as cardiac catheterization, angiography and the deployment of endovascular devices are routinely performed using x-ray fluoroscopy. To minimize the patient’s exposure to ionizing radiation, each fluoroscopic image is acquired using a very low x-ray exposure (~ 1 uR at the detector). At such an exposure, most semiconductor-based digital flat panel detectors (FPD) are not x-ray quantum noise limited (QNL) due to the presence of electronic noise which substantially degrades their imaging performance. The goal of this thesis was to investigate how a FPD based on amorphous selenium (a-Se) with internal avalanche multiplication gain could be used for QNL fluoroscopic imaging at the lowest clinical exposures while satisfying all of the requirements of a FPD for interventional radiology. Towards this end, it was first determined whether a-Se can reliably provide avalanche multiplication gain in the solid-state. An experimental method was developed which enabled the application of sufficiently large electric field strengths across the a-Se. This method resulted in avalanche gains as high as 10000 at an applied field of 105 V/um using optical excitation. This was the first time such high avalanche gains have been reported in a solid-state detector based on an amorphous material. Secondly, it was investigated how the solid-state a-Se avalanche detector could be used to image X-rays at diagnostic radiographic energies (~ 75 kVp). A dual-layered direct-conversion FPD architecture was proposed. It consisted of an x-ray drift region and a charge avalanche multiplication region and was found to eliminate depth-dependent gain fluctuation noise. It was shown that electric field strength non-uniformities in the a-Se do not degrade the detective quantum efficiency (DQE). Lastly, it was determined whether the solid-state a-Se avalanche detector satisfies all of the requirements of interventional radiology. Experimental results have shown that the total noise produced by the detector is negligible and that QNL operation at the lowest fluoroscopic exposures is indeed possible without any adverse effects occurring at much larger radiographic exposures. In conclusion, no fundamental obstacles were found preventing the use of avalanche a-Se in next-generation solid-state QNL FPDs for use in interventional radiology.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Study of Inhomogeneous Cosmologies Through Spacetime Matchings</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Giang, Dan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Our universe is inherently inhomogeneous yet it is common in the study of cosmology to model our universe after the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaıtre-Roberson-Walker (FLRW) model. In this thesis spacetime matchings are applied to investigate more general inhomogeneous cosmologies. The Cheese Slice universe, constructed from matching together FLRW and Kasner regions satisfying the Darmois matching conditions, is used as a prime example of an inhomogeneous cosmology. Some observational consequences of this model are presented. The lookback time verses redshift relation is calculated using a numerical algorithm and it is shown that the relative thickness of the Kasner regions have the greatest impact on anisotropies an observer would see. The number of layers and distribution of layers play a smaller role in this regard. The relative thickness of the Kasner slice should be on the order of one ten thousandth the thickness of the FLRW regions to have the anisotropies fall within the observed CMB limit. The approach to the singularity of a spacetime matching is examined. A criterion is presented for a matched spacetime to be considered Asymptotically Velocity Term Dominated (AVTD). Both sides of the matching must be AVTD and each leaf of the respective foliations mush match as well. It is demonstrated that the open and flat Cheese Slice universe are both AVTD and the singularity is also of AVTD type. The Cheese Slice model is then examined as a braneworld construction. The possibility of a Cheese Slice brane satisfying all the energy conditions is shown. However, the embedding of such a brane into a symmetric bulk is non-trivial. The general embedding of a matched spacetime into a bulk is investigated using a Taylor series approximation of the bulk. It is found that the energy-momentum tensor of such a brane cannot have discrete jumps if the embedding does not have a corner. A 3+1+1 decomposition of the bulk spacetime is then carried out. With the spacetime being deconstructed along two preferred timelike hypersurfaces, this becomes a natural environment to discuss the matching of branes. We find that there are conditions on the matter content of the branes to be matched if an observer on the brane is to see the matching surface as a boundary surface with no additional stress energy. Matching more than two bulks is also examined and shown to allow for more general brane configurations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental Investigation of the Dynamics and Structure of Lean-premixed Turbulent Combustion</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yuen, Frank Tat Cheong</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Turbulent premixed propane/air and methane/air flames were studied using planar Rayleigh scattering and particle image velocimetry on a stabilized Bunsen type burner. The fuel-air equivalence ratio was varied from Φ=0.7 to 1.0 for propane flames, and from Φ=0.6 to 1.0 for methane flames. The non-dimensional turbulence intensity, u'/SL (ratio of fluctuation velocity to laminar burning velocity), covered the range from 3 to 24, equivalent to conditions of corrugated flamelets and thin reaction zones regimes. Temperature gradients decreased with the increasing u'/SL and levelled off beyond u'/SL &gt; 10 for both propane and methane flames. Flame front thickness increased slightly as u'/SL increased for both mixtures, although the thickness increase was more noticeable for propane flames, which meant the thermal flame front structure was being thickened. A zone of higher temperature was observed on the average temperature profile in the preheat zone of the flame front as well as some instantaneous temperature profiles at the highest u'/SL. Curvature probability density functions were similar to the Gaussian distribution at all u'/SL for both mixtures and for all the flame sections. The mean curvature values decreased as a function of u'/SL and approached zero. Flame front thickness was smaller when evaluated at flame front locations with zero curvature than that with curvature. Temperature gradients and FSD were larger when the flame curvature was zero. The combined thickness and FSD data suggest that the curvature effect is more dominant than that of the stretch by turbulent eddies during flame propagation. Integrated flame surface density for both propane and methane flames exhibited no dependance on u'/SL regardless of the FSD method used for evaluation. This observation implies that flame surface area may not be the dominant factor in increasing the turbulent burning velocity and the flamelet assumption may not be valid under the conditions studied. Dκ term, the product of diffusivity evaluated at conditions studied and the flame front curvature, was a magnitude smaller than or the same magnitude as the laminar burning velocity.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Development of a High-order Finite-volume Method for the Navier-Stokes Equations in Three Dimensions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rashad, Ramy</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The continued research and development of high-order methods in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is primarily motivated by their potential to significantly reduce the computational cost and memory usage required to obtain a solution to a desired level of accuracy. In this work, a high-order Central Essentially Non-Oscillatory (CENO) finite-volume scheme is developed for the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions. The proposed CENO scheme is based on a hybrid solution reconstruction procedure using a fixed central stencil. A solution smoothness indicator facilitates the hybrid switching between a high-order k-exact reconstruction technique, and a monotonicity preserving limited piecewise linear reconstruction algorithm. The resulting scheme is applied to the compressible forms of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions. The latter of which includes the application of this high-order work to the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent non-reacting flows.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Measurement of the Top Quark Pair Production Cross-section in the Dilepton Channel using Lepton plus Track Selection and Identified b-jets</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Spreitzer, Teresa</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Using 1.0 fb^{-1} of data collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) from Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron, we measure the top-antitop production cross-section in events with two leptons, significant missing transverse energy, and at least jets, at least one of which is identified as a b-jet. As the Run II dataset grows, more stringent tests of Standard Model predictions for the top quark sector are becoming possible. The dilepton channel, where both top quarks decay t-&gt; W b -&gt;l nu b, is of particular interest due to its high purity. Use of an isolated track as the second lepton significantly increases the dilepton acceptance, at the price of some increase in background, particularly from W + jets events where one of the jets is identified as a lepton. To control the increase in background we add to the event selection the requirement that at least one of the jets be identified as a b-jet, reducing the background contribution from all sources. Assuming a branching ratio of BR(W-&gt;l nu) = 10.8% and a top mass of m_top = 175 GeV/c^{2} the measured cross-section is sigma = (10.5 +/- 1.8 stat. +/- 0.8 syst. +/- 0.6 lumi.) pb.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electronic Excitations in Lanthanum Cuprates Measured by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ellis, David</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Excitations of the valence electrons in the high-temperature superconducting cuprate La2−xSrxCuO4 were measured by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS). Several types of electronic excitations resonant at the Cu 1s →4p transition were studied over a wide range of dopings 0&lt;x&lt;0.35. A 500 meV excitation was observed at a reduced momentum transfer q=(π 0) corresponding to the zone boundary, whose temperature and doping dependence was the same as the two-magnon Raman scattering mode. The momentum dependence of this 2-magnon excitation agrees with recent theoretical calculations. Momentum resolved measurements of the x=0 sample revealed a broad range of excitations above and below the main charge transfer peak, and their dispersions were measured across the Brillouin zone. These include a dispersionless ∼1.8 eV peak, which is either a local crystal field (d-d excitation) or dipole-forbidden charge transfer excitation, and a dispersive 2.2 eV peak identified as a Zhang-Ng type charge-transfer exciton. The 2.2 eV peak was less dispersive than predicted from the theoretical models, due to electron-phonon coupling, as illustrated by the temperature dependent shift in the peak position. With increased hole doping, the RIXS spectral weight transfers from higher to lower energies, analogous to earlier optical conductivity studies. At the finite momentum of q=(π 0), however, the changes are most systematic: an isosbestic point was observed at 2.2 eV where the spectra of all dopings cross, and spectral weight is transferred from high to low energies, with near-linear dependence on x, in a manner suggesting that the integrated RIXS intensity is preserved. The intensity and energy variations of the spectral peaks, as well as the isosbestic point and possible sum rule, could be explained qualitatively by a rigid three-band model which includes the non-bonding oxygen, upper Hubbard, and Zhang-Rice singlet bands. The estimated properties of the bands, such as width and energy separation, are in reasonably quantitative agreement with current theoretical models and angle-resolved photoemission measurements. Moreover, anomalies in the doping dependence are similar to those observed in other types of spectroscopies. These results underscore the relevance of the RIXS method in understanding the electronic behavior of the Lanthanum cuprates.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Decoherence in Optically Excited Semiconductors: a Perspective from Non-equilibrium Green Functions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Virk, Kuljit</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Decoherence is central to our understanding of the transition from the quantum to the classical world. It is also a way of probing the dynamics of interacting many-body systems. Photoexcited semiconductors are such systems in which the transient dynamics can be studied in considerable detail experimentally. Recent advances in spectroscopy of semiconductors provide powerful tools to explore many-body physics in new regimes. An appropriate theoretical framework is necessary to describe new physical effects now accessible for observation. We present a possible approach in this thesis, and discuss results of its application to an experimentally relevant scenario. The major portion of this thesis is devoted to a formalism for the multi-dimensional Fourier spectroscopy of semiconductors. A perturbative treatment of the electromagnetic field is used to derive a closed set of differential equations for the multi-particle correlation functions, which take into account the many-body effects up to third order in the field. A diagrammatic method is developed, in which we retain all features of the double-sided Feynman diagrams for bookkeeping the excitation scenario, and complement them by allowing for the description of interactions. We apply the formalism to study decoherence between the states of optically excited excitons embedded in an electron gas, and compare it with the decoherence between these states and the ground state. We derive a dynamical equation for the two-time correlation functions of excitons, and compare it with the corresponding equation for the interband polarization. It is argued, and verified by numerical calculation, that the decay of Raman coherence depends sensitively on how differently the superimposed exciton states interact with the electron gas, and that it can be much slower than the decay of interband polarization. We also present a new numerical approach based on the length gauge for modeling the time-dependent laser-semiconductor interaction. The interaction in the length gauge involves the position operator for electrons, as opposed to the momentum operator in the velocity gauge. The approach is free of the unphysical divergences that arise in the velocity gauge. It is invariant under local gauge symmetry of the Bloch functions, and can handle arbitrary electronic structure and temporal dependence of the fields.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Numerical Model for Oil/Water Separation from a Solid Particle</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Fan, Eric Sheung-Chi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A computational fluid dynamics model has been developed to study an oil-coated particle immersed in a uniform aqueous flow, to determine the conditions that favour oil separation. The governing flow equations are discretized using a finite volume approach, and the oil/water interface is captured using the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method in a 2D spherical coordinate system. The model predicts different mechanisms for oil separation. At a Reynolds number, Re, equal to 1, and at a low capillary number, Ca &lt;&lt; 1, the high interfacial tension can induce rapid contact line motion, to the extent that the oil film can advance past its equilibrium position and separate from the particle. This mechanism requires that the contact angle measured through the oil phase is large. On the other hand, as Ca approaches 1, the shear exerted by the external flow stretches the oil into a thread that will eventually rupture and separate.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Study of a Semiconductor Nanowire under a Scanning Probe Tip Gate</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lau, Jacky Kai-Tak</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Nanowires are sensitive to external influences such as surface charges or external electric fields. An Atomic Force Microsope (AFM) is modified to perform back gating and tip gating measurements in order to understand the interaction between an external field, and surface charge and nanowire conductance. A 2D finite element method (FEM) model is developed to simulate the measured conductance. The model shows that surface states play a critical role in determining nanowire conductance. A 3D FEM model is developed to examine the influence of the AFM tip on the lateral resolution of the AFM tip in the electrostatic measurement. The radius of the AFM tip determines the lateral resolution of the tip. However, carrier concentration in the nanowire establishes a lower limit on the lateral resolution, for small tip radii. These results enable one to optimize Scanning Probe Microscopy experiments as well as inform sample preparation for nanowire characterization.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental Constraints on Lithium Exchange between Clinopyroxene, Olivine and Aqueous Fluid at High Pressures and Temperatures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Caciagli-Warman, Natalie</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Clinopyroxene, olivine, plagioclase and hydrous fluid lithium partition coefficients have been measured between 800-1100oC at 1 GPa. Clinopyroxene-fluid partitioning is a function of temperature (ln DLicpx/fluid = -7.3 (+0.5) + 7.0 (+0.7) * 1000/T) and appears to increase with increasing pyroxene Al2O3 content. Olivine-fluid partitioning of lithium is a function of temperature (ln DLiol/fluid = -6.0 (+2.0) + 6.5 (+2.0) * 1000/T) and appears to be sensitive to olivine Mg/Fe content. Anorthite-fluid lithium partitioning is a function of feldspar composition, similar to the partitioning of other cations in the feldspar-fluid system. Isotopic fractionation between clinopyroxene and fluid, Licpx-fluid, has been measured between 900-1100oC and ranges from -0.3 to -3.4 ‰ (±1.4 ‰). Lithium diffusion has been measured in clinopyroxene at 800-1000oC and in olivine at 1000oC. The lithium diffusion coefficient is independent of the diffusion gradient as values are the same if the flux of lithium is into or out of the crystal and ranges from -15.19 ± 2.86 m2/s at 800oC to -11.97 ± 0.86 m2/s at 1000oC. Lithium diffusion in olivine was found to be two orders of magnitude slower than for clinopyroxene at similar conditions. Closure temperatures calculated for lithium diffusion in clinopyroxene range from ~400 to ~600oC. These results demonstrate that lithium equilibration between fluids and minerals is instantaneous, on a geological timescales. The confirmation of instantaneous equilibration, combined with min-fluid partition coefficients and values for Licpx-fluid, permits quantitative modeling of the evolution of lithium concentration and isotopic composition in slab-derived fluids during transport to the arc melt source. Our results indicate that fluids migrating by porous flow will rapidly exchange lithium with the mantle, effectively buffering the fluid composition close to ambient mantle values, and rapidly attenuating the slab lithium signature. Fluid transport mechanisms involving fracture flow are required to maintain a slab-like lithium signature (both elemental and isotopic) from the slab to the melt source of island arc basalts. This study demonstrates that mineral-fluid equilibration is rapid, and as a result the lithium content of minerals can only reliably represent chemical exchange in the very latest stages of the sample’s history.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Adaptive Optimal-control Algorithms for Brainlike Networks</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chinta Venkateswararao, Lakshminarayan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Many neural control systems are at least roughly optimized, but how is optimal control learned in the brain? There are algorithms for this purpose, but in their present forms they aren’t suited for biological neural networks because they rely on a type of communication that isn’t available in the brain, namely weight transport — transmitting the strengths, or “weights”, of individual synapses to other synapses and neurons. Here I show how optimal control can be learned without weight transport. I explore three complementary approaches. In the first, I show that the control-theory concept of feedback linearization can form the basis for a simple mechanism that learns roughly optimal control, at least in some sensorimotor tasks. Second, I describe a method based on Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle of optimal control, by which a network without weight transport might achieve optimal open-loop control. Third, I describe a mechanism for building optimal feedback controllers, without weight transport, by a method based on generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Finally, I argue that the issues raised in these three projects apply quite broadly, i.e. most control algorithms rely on weight transport in many different ways, but it may be possible to recast them into forms that are free of such transport by the mechanisms I propose.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Quantum-classical Investigation of Environmental Effects on Electronic Dynamics at Conical Intersections</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kelly, Aaron</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis we employ the methods of quantum classical Liouville theory in order to explore the effects of an external environment on electronic dynamics, in systems containing conical intersections. In studying a simple, yet nontrivial, model in the gas phase we find that the short-time dynamics are well approximated by a hybrid MC/MD solution to the QCL equation. Upon including an external environment the population transfer profile changes, based on the various paramter values chosen. Electronic decoherence and the partial/complete destruction of geometric phase effects are also observed. Based on earlier work on master equation dynamics in QCL theory, we find that a Markovian approximation to the dynamics for systems containing conical intersections is not easily justified. In order to access longer time-scale phenomena another, less computationally demanding, solution method was also derived in the mapping basis. This method involves more severe approximations to the QCL equation than the MC/MD method, and as such is not as physically robust, yet still manages to reproduce some important aspects of the dynamics over a picosecond time-scale.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Tidal Dissipation in Extrasolar Planets</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pena, Fernando Gabriel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Many known extra-solar giant planets lie close to their host stars. Around 60 have their semi-major axes smaller than 0.05 AU. In contrast to planets further out, the vast majority of these close-in planets have low eccentricity orbits. This suggests that their orbits have been circularized likely due to tidal dissipation inside the planets. These exoplanets share with our own Jupiter at least one trait in common: when they are subject to periodic tidal forcing, they behave like a lossy spring, with a tidal ``quality factor'', Q, of order 10^5. This parameter is the ratio between the energy in the tide and the energy dissipated per period. To explain this, a possible solution is resonantly forced internal oscillation. If the frequency of the tidal forcing happens to land on that of an internal eigenmode, this mode can be resonantly excited to a very large amplitude. The damping of such a mode inside the planet may explain the observed Q value. The only normal modes that fall in the frequency range of the tidal forcing (~ few days) are inertial modes, modes restored by the Coriolis force. We present a new numerical technique to solve for inertial modes in a convective, rotating sphere. This technique combines the use of an ellipsoidal coordinate system with a pseudo-spectral method to solve the partial differential equation that governs the inertial oscillations. We show that, this technique produces highly accurate solutions when the density profile is smooth. In particular, the lines of nodes are roughly parallel to the ellipsoidal coordinate axes. In particular, using these accurate solutions, we estimate the resultant tidal dissipation for giant planets, and find that turbulent dissipation of inertial modes in planets with smooth density profiles do not give rise to dissipation as strong as the one observed. We also study inertial modes in density profiles that exhibit discontinuities, as some recent models of Jupiter show. We found that, in this case, our method could not produce convergent solutions for the inertial modes. Additionally, we propose a way to observe inertial modes inside Saturn indirectly, by observing waves in its rings that may be excited by inertial modes inside Saturn.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Buoyant Plumes with Inertial and Chemical Reaction-driven Forcing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rogers, Michael C.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Plumes are formed when a continuous buoyant forcing is supplied at a localized source. Buoyancy can be created by either a heat flux, a compositional difference between the fluid coming from the source and its surroundings, or a combination of both. In this thesis, two types of laminar plumes with different forcing mechanisms were investigated: forced plumes and autocatalytic plumes. The forced plumes were compositionally buoyant and were injected with inertial forcing into a fluid filled tank. The autocatalytic plumes were produced without mechanical forcing by buoyancy that was entirely the consequence of a nonlinear chemical reaction -- the iodate-arsenous acid (IAA) reaction. This reaction propagates as a reacting front and produces buoyancy by its exothermicity, and by the compositional difference between the reactant and product. Both the forced and autocatalytic plumes were examined in starting and steady states. The starting, or transient, state of the plume occurs when it initially rises through a fluid and develops a plume head on top of a trailing conduit. The steady state emerges after the plume head has risen to the top of a fluid filled tank leaving only a persistent conduit. Plume behaviour was studied through experimentation, simulation, and by using simple theoretical analysis. We performed the first ever study of plumes as they crossed over the transition between buoyancy-driven to momentum-driven flow. Regardless of the driving mechanism, forced plumes were found to exhibit a single power law relationship that explains their ascent velocity. However, the morphology of the plume heads was found to depend on the dominating driving mechanism. Confined heads were produced by buoyancy-driven plumes, and dispersed heads by momentum-driven plumes. Autocatalytic plumes were found to have rich dynamics that are a consequence of the interplay between fluid flow and chemical reaction. These plumes produced accelerating heads that detached from the conduit, forming free vortex rings. A second-generation head would then develop at the point of detachment. The detachment process for plumes was sensitively dependent on small fluctuations in their initial formation. In some cases, head detachment could occur multiple times for a single experimental run, thereby producing several generations of autocatalytic vortex rings. Head detachment was reproduced and studied using autocatalytic plume simulations. Autocatalytic flame balls, a phenomenon closely related to autocatalytic plumes, were also simulated. Flame balls were found to have three dynamical regimes. Below a critical radius, the smallest flame balls experienced front death. Above this radius, they formed elongating, reacting tails. The largest flame balls formed filamentary tails unable to sustain a reaction.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Scattering-based Approach to the Design, Analysis, and Experimental Verification of Magnetic Metamaterials Made from Dielectrics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wheeler, Mark Stephen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The design, modeling, fabrication, and validation of an optical magnetic response in dielectric-based metamaterials are studied. These metamaterials consist of either periodic or random arrays of dielectric particle inclusions, which may be spheres, coated spheres, or completely randomly shaped. It is demonstrated that because of the simple particle shapes and dielectric materials, these metamaterials are quite easy and feasible to implement in a bulk, three-dimensional sample, and the response is isotropic. This in is contrast to other predominant designs of optical metamaterials, which are planar and anisotropic arrays of complicated metallic fishnet or split-ring resonator structures, which require stringent tolerances and sophisticated assembly. It is shown that SiC is one of many materials from which such infrared magnetic metamaterials can be constructed. A simple SiC powder is used to verify these claims. The milled micropowder of crystalline SiC is comprised of particles of random shapes and sizes. A model of the electromagnetic response of such powders is developed, whereby the induced magnetic dipole response is modeled by equivalently-sized spheres of SiC, whereas the electric dipole response is modeled by a continuous distribution of ellipsoidal particles. Infrared spectroscopic measurements and numerical calculations are performed, verifying both the magnetic and electric response of the powder. A alternate approach is also described, where uniform SiC microspheres are fabricated using more sophisticated nanochemical techniques. In the final portion of the dissertation, the mutual near-field coupling between ideal magnetic dipoles induced in dielectric spheres is studied. This is implemented for microwave frequencies using large permittivity ceramic spheres. An approximate coupled dipole model of the multiple scattering among the spheres is developed, and a transition matrix method is implemented to calculate the exact scattering by the clusters. Experimental measurements are performed, confirming the two models. The results for pairs, chains, and rings of spheres indicates that the magnetic dipole modes hybridize in analogy to atomic bonding. A notable result is that certain hybridized magnetic dipole modes may have a net electric dipole moment. The similarity to atomic and molecular bonding should prove useful in conceptualizing and designing more sophisticated metamaterials.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Time-varying Phononic Crystals</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wright, Derek</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The primary objective of this thesis was to gain a deeper understanding of acoustic wave propagation in phononic crystals, particularly those that include materials whose properties can be varied periodically in time. This research was accomplished in three ways. First, a 2D phononic crystal was designed, created, and characterized. Its properties closely matched those determined through simulation. The crystal demonstrated band gaps, dispersion, and negative refraction. It served as a means of elucidating the practicalities of phononic crystal design and construction and as a physical verification of their more interesting properties. Next, the transmission matrix method for analyzing 1D phononic crystals was extended to include the effects of time-varying material parameters. The method was then used to provide a closed-form solution for the case of periodically time-varying material parameters. Some intriguing results from the use of the extended method include dramatically altered transmission properties and parametric amplification. New insights can be gained from the governing equations and have helped to identify the conditions that lead to parametric amplification in these structures. Finally, 2D multiple scattering theory was modified to analyze scatterers with time-varying material parameters. It is shown to be highly compatible with existing multiple scattering theories. It allows the total scattered field from a 2D time-varying phononic crystal to be determined. It was shown that time-varying material parameters significantly affect the phononic crystal transmission spectrum, and this was used to switch an incident monochromatic wave. Parametric amplification can occur under certain circumstances, and this effect was investigated using the closed-form solutions provided by the new 1D method. The complexity of the extended methods grows logarithmically as opposed linearly with existing methods, resulting in superior computational complexity for large numbers of scatterers. Also, since both extended methods provide analytic solutions, they may give further insights into the factors that govern the behaviour of time-varying phononic crystals. These extended methods may now be used to design an active phononic crystal that could demonstrate new or enhanced properties.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Development of Deep-level Photo-thermal Spectroscopy and Photo-Carrier Radiometry for the Characterization of Semi-insulating Gallium Arsenide (SI-GaAs)</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Xia, Jun</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Semi-insulating gallium arsenide (SI-GaAs) has gained great interest in recent years due to its wide application in optoelectronic devices and high-speed integrated circuits. An important feature of SI-GaAs is the high density of deep-level defect states, which control the electrical properties of the substrate by compensating the shallow defects. Over the years, deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and its variations have been the most effective tools employed for the characterization of deep-level defects. However, most of these techniques require a contact probe and tend to be quite restrictive in their applications’ scope. In this thesis deep-level photo-thermal spectroscopy (DLPTS), an all-optical rate-window-based technique, is presented as a novel noncontact technique for the characterization of deep-level defects in SI-GaAs. The signal-generation mechanism for DLPTS is the super-bandgap excitation of carriers, and the sub-bandgap detection of the defect’s thermal-emission process. Combined with the rate-window detection utilizing lock-in amplifiers, DLPTS measurements are performed in three different modalities: temperature-scan, pulse-rate scan, and time-scan. This work demonstrates that each mode provides unique information about the defect configuration, and, in combination, the modes offer a powerful tool for the study of defect properties and optoelectronic processes in SI-GaAs. A hierarchical carrier-emission theory is proposed to explain the thermal broadening (nonexponentiality) in photo-thermal spectra. The model is studied comparatively with the Gaussian distribution of activation energies, and their similarities demonstrate an ergodic equivalence of random energy distribution and the constrained hierarchical emission process. In addition, a rate-window gated photo-carrier radiometry (PCR) technique is developed. The original diffusion-based PCR theory is modified to reflect the signal domination by trap emission and capture rates in the absence of diffusion. Defect luminescence is collected and analyzed using photo-thermal temperature spectra and resonant detection combined with frequency scans. The study results in the identification of five radiative defect states and the defect-photoluminescence quantum efficiency.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Coupled Interface Modes for Nonlinear Interaction in Periodic Layered Media</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Arjmand, Arghavan Jr.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis proposes the platform for the observation of a new type of electromagnetic interface mode, Coupled Interface Mode, and studies the utilization of this mode in second order nonlinear interaction in AlGaAs. The dispersion relations for theoretical examination of the modes are developed and used to design a waveguide structure that accommodates a three wave mixing process utilizing coupled interface modes. The waveguides are fabricated according to optimized fabrication recipes and characterized for linear and nonlinear properties. Second harmonic generation is adopted for the demonstration of nonlinear interaction, due to its convenient experimental set-up. Three different laser sources are used to pump the waveguides and second harmonic light is generated and characterized. Coupled interface modes in conjunction with other types of modes also existing within the same structures, offer the possibility to explore three-wave mixing processes such as sum and difference frequency generation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Planar Photonic Crystals for Biosensing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>El Beheiry, Mohamed</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, planar photonic crystals for optofluidic biosensing applications are analyzed. Planar photonic crystals are optically resonant structures which possess modal characteristics which can be exploited for biosensing applications. Sensing is achieved by detecting changes in refractive index due to analyte interactions in a sampled fluid. This work describes a broad study of photonic crystal slab sensors, with special consideration to biosensing. Outlined are considerations pertaining to sensing figures of merit, device fabrication, and performance. Results of simulations and device characterization indicate that planar photonic crystals possess sensing attributes similar or better than existing optically resonant refractive index sensors, such as surface plasmon resonance, grating, and interferometric waveguide sensors. Additionally, these photonic crystals can be patterned in large-areas which enable a simple light coupling scheme. All considered, their appeal as a biosensing solution is justified in the area of in vitro diagnostics.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Towards a Design Tool for Turbomachinery</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Epp, Duane R.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A two-dimensional thin-layer Navier-Stokes cascade flow solver for turbomachinery is developed. A second-order finite-difference scheme and a second and fourth-difference dissipation scheme are used. Periodic and non-reflecting inlet and outlet boundary conditions are implemented into the approximate-factorization numerical method. Turbulence is modeled through the one-equation Spalart-Allmaras model. A two-dimensional turbomachinery cascade structured grid generator is developed to produce six-block H-type grids. The validity of this work is tested in various ways. A grid convergence study is performed showing the effect of grid density. The non-reflecting inlet and outlet boundary conditions are tested for boundary placement influence. Comparisons of the flow solver numerical results are performed against experimental results. A Mach number sweep and angle of attack sweep are performed on two similar transonic turbine cascades.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nonlinear Parametric Generation in Birefringent Poled Fibers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhu, Eric Yi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Conventional step-index silica fibers do not possess a second-order optical nonlinearity due to symmetry concerns. However, through the process of poling, the generation of a frozen-in DC field $E^{DC}$, and in turn, a non-zero second-order nonlinearity $\chi^{(2)} = 3\chi^{(3)}E^{DC}$, can be created in optical fibers. In this thesis, I measure the individual $\chi^{(2)}$ tensor elements of birefringent periodically poled fiber via second-harmonic generation and sum-frequency generation experiments. The symmetry of the $\chi^{(2)}$ tensor is consistent with that of the $\chi^{(3)}$ for isotropic media. This is the first study that characterizes all the $\chi^{(2)}$ tensor elements in birefringent poled fiber. Furthermore, I investigate the intermix of the $\chi^{(2)}$ tensor elements by twisting the fiber, which results in the generation of new second-harmonic signals not observed in untwisted fiber. The conversion efficiencies and spectral positions of these new signals can be varied by twisting the fiber.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Time-dependent Photomodulation of a Single Atom Tungsten Tip Tunnelling Barrier</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zia, Haider</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>There has been much work on electron emission. It has lead to the concept of the photon and new electron sources for imaging such as electron microscopes and the rst formulation of holographic reconstructions [1-6]. Analytical derivations are important to gain physical insight into the problem of developing better electron sources. However, to date, such formulations have su ered by a number of approximations that have masked important physics. In this thesis, a new approach is provided that solves the Schrodinger wave equation for photoemission from a single atom tungsten tip barrier or more generally, for photoemission from a Schottky triangular barrier potential, with or without image potential e ects. We describe the system, then introduce the mathematical derivation. We conclude with the applications of the theory.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Wideband Plasmonic Slot-silicon Wire Coupling</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lau, Benedict</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>An SOI-based platform designed for wideband coupling of light from optical fibers to a 50 nm wide plasmonic slot waveguide is described in this thesis. The device is based on a newly proposed orthogonal junction with coupling efficiencies above 70% near the telecom wavelength. To construct the coupling platform, two such junctions are utilized for input and output, where Si wires are place 90 degree with respect to each of the two ends of a plasmonic section. Analytic studies and FDTD simulations have demonstrated attractive properties such as a smooth micron-wide transmission spectrum that can be spectrally shifted with the design parameters, and the natural phase-matching between the dielectric and plasmonic sections consequent of the waveguide orientations. Fabrication procedures and proof-of-concept characterization work are also presented. The experimentally-tested platform with its unique features would enable applications in on-chip sensing and plasmonic slot-based waveguiding at the 50 nm scale.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Platform to Monitor Tumor Cellular and Vascular Response to Radiation Therapy by Optical Coherence Tomography and Fluorescence Microscopy in vivo</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Leung, Michael Ka Kit</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Radiotherapy plays a significant role in cancer treatment, and is thought to be curative by mainly killing tumor cells through damage to their genetic material. However, recent findings indicate that the tumor’s vascular blood supply is also a major determinant of radiation response. The goals of this thesis are to: (1) develop an experimental platform for small animals to deliver ionizing radiation and perform high-resolution optical imaging to treatment targets, and (2) use this toolkit to longitudinally monitor the response of tumors and the associated vasculature. The thesis has achieved: (1) customization of a novel micro-irradiator for mice, (2) technical development of an improved optical coherence tomography imaging system, (3) comprehensive experimental protocol and imaging optimization for optical microscopy in a specialized animal model, and (4) completion of a feasibility study to demonstrate the capabilities of the experimental platform in monitoring the response of tumor and vasculature to radiotherapy.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Sigal, Iliya</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The three wave mixing process was modeled in GaAs:AlGaAs superlattices using two new modeling tools that were developed in the course of this work: A 2D beam propagation tool for optimizing quasi-phase matching gratings, and a 1D iterative beam propagation tool for determining the output powers and threshold of optical parametric oscillators of arbitrary geometries. The 2D tool predicts close to 80% enhancement of conversion e ciency by phase matching near 800 nm compared to 775 nm, which was the originally designed operation wavelength. The model also predicts resonant behaviour for an abrupt grating pro le. The 1D tool was used to determine the threshold conditions for para- metric oscillation for di erent geometries. The performances of di erent phase matching approaches in AlGaAs were quantitatively compared. The model also indicated the need for pulsed operation to achieve reasonably low threshold powers in AlGaAs waveguides.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Mass-independent Fractionation of Mercury Isotopes in Freshwater Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rose, Carla</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of Hg isotopes has the potential to track the environmental transport and fate of Hg. Herein we demonstrate that reducing both the frequency and intensity of light have a large effect on the expression and magnitude of MIF. This strongly supports the magnetic isotope effect as the mechanism behind MIF observed during aqueous photo-reduction of Hg(II) and MeHg. The ratios of MIF, KapDelta199Hg/KapDelta201Hg, were 1.00 ± 0.04 (2SE) for Hg(II) and 1.35 ± 0.16 (2SE) for MeHg respectively and did not change as incident radiation energy and magnitude of MIF diminished, suggesting the respective MIF pathways remained constant regardless of experimental conditions. Comparable amounts of total photo-reduction were shown to coincide with different magnitudes of MIF depending the wavelength light available for photo-reduction. This confirms there are multiple pathways for photo-reduction in freshwater reservoirs and indicates that quantitatively relating photo-reduction and MIF will be challenging.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Structural Color and Odors: Towards a Photonic Crystal Nose Platform</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bonifacio, Leonardo da Silva</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The present thesis describes a novel photonic crystal platform dubbed the photonic nose, a color-based analogue of the human olfactory system. The platform is founded on a one dimensional photonic crystal architecture known as Bragg stacks, which are fabricated using bottom-up self-assembly approaches. Structural and compositional aspects of this novel class of photonic crystals are established that provide them with functionality and utility. Silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, tin oxide, clays and zeolites are among the materials incorporated into one-dimensional photonic structures. Retention of materials functionality is demonstrated by vapor and liquid sensing experiments. This class of Bragg stacks displays well defined optical properties that have been thoroughly investigated by use of spectroscopic ellipsometry, as we demonstrate in a chapter dedicated to the technique. Utilizing conventional building blocks comprised of nanostructured silicon and titanium dioxide we discuss various aspects of technique pertaining single layered as well as multilayered films. In terms of practical applications these kinds of Bragg stacks show significant potential in areas such as display and sensors that exploit their vibrant and tunable colors. These colors are an important attribute of photonic crystals with bandgaps in the visible range and in this thesis work we present new approaches for characterizing photonic crystal color using well established methods from the field of color imagery. With this knowhow we have been able to assemble a pixilated array of chemically functionalized Bragg stacks in which each pixel responds differently to vapor phase analytes. The combinatorial response of the entire array enables a unique diagnostic fingerprint of a given analyte vapor as determined from color imagery and multivariate statistical methods of analysis. It was possible to discriminate between ethanol, butanol, hexanol, hexane, octane and decane. We also demonstrate the power of the photonic nose platform by distinguishing different bacteria from a photonic nose color analysis of the complex mixture of vapors in the bacteria culture headspace. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa could be discriminated based on this technique.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Theory and Applications of Multiconductor Transmission Line Analysis for Shielded Sievenpiper and Related Structures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Elek, Francis</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis focuses on the analytical modeling of periodic structures which contain bands with multiple modes of propagation. The work is motivated by several structures which exhibit dual-mode propagation bands. Initially, transmission line models are focused on. Transmission line models of periodic structures have been used extensively in a wide variety of applications due to their simplicity and the ease with which one can physically interpret the resulting wave propagation effects. These models, however, are fundamentally limited, as they are only capable of capturing a single mode of propagation. In this work multiconductor transmission line theory, which is the multi-mode generalization of transmission line theory, is shown to be an effective and accurate technique for the analytical modeling of periodically loaded structures which support multiple modes of propagation. Many results from standard periodic transmission line analysis are extended and generalized in the multiconductor line analysis, providing a familiar intuitive model of the propagation phenomena. The shielded Sievenpiper structure, a periodic multilayered geometry, is analyzed in depth, and provides a canonical example of the developed analytical method. The shielded Sievenpiper structure exhibits several interesting properties which the multiconductor transmission line analysis accurately captures. It is shown that under a continuous change of geometrical parameters, the dispersion curves for the shielded structure are transformed from dual-mode to single-mode. The structure supports a stop-band characterized by complex modes, which appear as pairs of frequency varying complex conjugate propagation constants. These modes are shown to arise even though the structure is modeled as lossless. In addition to the periodic analysis, the scattering properties of finite cascades of such structures are analyzed and related to the dispersion curves generated from the periodic analysis. Excellent correspondence with full wave finite element method simulations is demonstrated. In conclusion, a physical application is presented: a compact unidirectional ring-slot antenna utilizing the shielded Sievenpiper structure is constructed and tested.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Probing Early and Late Inflations Beyond Tilted LambdaCDM</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Huang, Zhiqi Jr.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The topic of this thesis is about cosmic inflations, including the early-universe inflation that seeds the initial inhomogeneities of our universe, and the late-time cosmic acceleration triggered by dark energy. The two inflationary epochs have now become part of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. In the standard paradigm, dark energy is a cosmological constant or vacuum energy, while the early-universe inflation is driven by a slowly rolling scalar field. Currently the minimal $\Lambda$CDM model with six parameters agrees well with cosmological observations. If the greatest achievement of the last twenty golden years of cosmology is the $\Lambda$CDM model, the theme of future precision cosmology will be to search for deviations from the minimal $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. It is in fact expected that the upcoming breakthroughs of cosmology will be achieved by observing the subdominant anomalies, such as non-Gaussianities in the Cosmic Microwave Background map. The aim of this thesis is then to make theoretical predictions from models beyond $\Lambda$CDM, and confront them with cosmological observations. These models include: 1) a new dark energy parametrization based on quintessence models; 2) reconstructing early-universe inflationary trajectories, going beyond the slow-roll assumption; 3) non-Gaussian curvature fluctuations from preheating after the early-universe inflation; 4) infra-red cascading produced by particle production during inflation; 5) preheating after Modular inflation; 6) decaying cold dark matter. We update the cosmological data sets -- Cosmic Microwave Background, Type Ia supernova, weak gravitational lensing, galaxy power spectra, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest -- to the most current catalog, and run Monte Carlo Markov Chain calculations to obtain the likelihood of parameters. We also simulate mock data to forecast future observational constraints.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Microcanonical Density of States and Causal Dynamical Triangulations</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Thomson, Mitchell</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Brown and York's gravitational microcanonical density of states is extended to general spacetime dimension and shown to be dependent upon features of the 4 dimensional gravitational action for its interpretation. Black hole entropy is calculated from the density of states path integral in general spacetime dimension, and the interpretation is shown to be likewise dependent upon the dimension of spacetime. The entropy of de Sitter and Rindler horizons are calculated using the black hole density of states and the notion of local horizon entropy density is shown to be supported. The applicability of the microcanonical ensemble to black hole mechanics is discussed at a fundamental level focussing on the absence of angular velocity as an external parameter in the gravitational Hamiltonian. The rotational ensemble and a new ensemble - the angular momentum ensemble - are introduced following Jaynes' information theory approach to statistical mechanics and proposed as more compelling candidates to calculate black hole entropy as a function of state. A program to calculate the density of states path integral non-perturbatively using causal dynamical triangulations is initiated. Regge calculus expressions for extrinsic curvature are extended to the case of Lorentzian hypersurfaces and used to derive Regge calculus expressions for quasilocal energy-momentum. The Regge version of the black hole density of states action is derived and specialised to the 3d and 4d spacetime constructions of causal dynamical triangulations. Finally, the recent suggestion that entropy is observer dependent is shown to be incompatible with the Tolman law for the equilibrium temperature in a gravitational field.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Pillar-array Based Two-dimensional Photonic Crystal Cavities: A New Paradigm for Optical Sensing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Xu, Alan Tao</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Pillar-array based optical cavities have unique properties, e.g., having a large and connected low dielectric index space (normally air space), exhibiting a large band gap for transverse magnetic modes, having a large percent of electric field energy in air and standing on a substrate. These properties make them well suitable for applications such as optical sensing and terahertz quantum cascade lasers. However there has been rare research in it due to the common belief that pillar arrays have excessive leakage to the substrate. With careful design, we provided several methods to reduce such a leakage and experimentally proved a high quality factor (Q) pillar-array based cavity is practical. We also explored the usage of such a cavity for optical sensing. Numerical methods such as finite-difference time-domain and plane-wave expansion were used in the design of the cavity. Then in microwave spectrum, cavities consisting of dielectric rods were used to test the validity of the theory. Additionally, we observed that a high-Q cavity for modes above light line is feasible and it is very suitable to measure the optical absorption of materials introduce inside the mode volume. Finally in the optical domain, pillar arrays were fabricated in Si/SiO2 material system and measured. Q as high as 27,600 was shown and when applying accurate refractive indices, for every delta n = 0.01, the peak wavelength shifted as large as 3.5 nm, testifying the ultra sensitivity of the cavity to the environmental dielectric change.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Aerosol Characterization and Analytical Modeling of Concentric Pneumatic and Flow Focusing Nebulizers for Sample Introduction</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kashani, Arash</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A concentric pneumatic nebulizer (CPN) and a custom designed flow focusing nebulizer (FFN) are characterized. As will be shown, the classical Nukiyama-Tanasawa and Rizk-Lefebvre models lead to erroneous size prediction for the concentric nebulizer under typical operating conditions due to its specific design, geometry, dimension and different flow regimes. The models are then modified to improve the agreement with the experimental results. The size prediction of the modified models together with the spray velocity characterization are used to determine the overall nebulizer efficiency and also employed as input to a new Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) based model to predict joint size-velocity distribution analytically. The new MEP model is exploited to study the local variation of size-velocity distribution in contrast to the classical models where MEP is applied globally to the entire spray cross section. As will be demonstrated, the velocity distribution of the classical MEP models shows poor agreement with experiments for the cases under study. Modifications to the original MEP modeling are proposed to overcome this deficiency. In addition, the new joint size-velocity distribution agrees better with our general understanding of the drag law and yields realistic results. ; PhD</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Large-eddy Simulation of Premixed Turbulent Combustion Using Flame Surface Density Approach</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lin, Wen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the last 10-15 years, large-eddy simulation (LES) has become well established for non-reacting flows, and several successful models have been developed for the transfer of momentum and kinetic energy to the subfilter-scales (SFS). However, for reacting flows, LES is still undergoing significant development. In particular, for many premixed combustion applications, the chemical reactions are confined to propagating surfaces that are significantly thinner than the computational grids used in practical LES. In these situations, the chemical kinetics and its interaction with the turbulence are not resolved and must be entirely modelled. There is, therefore, a need for accurate and robust physical modelling of combustion at the subfilter-scales. In this thesis, modelled transport equations for progress variable and flame surface density (FSD) were implemented and coupled to the Favre-filtered Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible reactive thermally perfect mixture. In order to reduce the computational costs and increase the resolution of simulating combusting flows, a parallel adaptive mesh (AMR) refinement finite-volume algorithm was extended and used for the prediction of turbulent premixed flames. The proposed LES methodology was applied to the numerical solution of freely propagating flames in decaying isotropic turbulent flow and Bunsen-type flames. Results for both stoichiometric and lean flames are presented. Comparisons are made between turbulent flame structure predictions for methane, propane, hydrogen fuels, and other available numerical results and experimental data. Details of subfilter-scale modelling, numerical solution scheme, computational results, and capabilities of the methodology for predicting premixed combustion processes are included in the discussions. The current study represents the first application of a full transport equation model for the FSD to LES of a laboratory-scale turbulent premixed flame. The comparisons of the LES results of this thesis to the experimental data provide strong support for the validity of the modelled transport equation for the FSD. While the LES predictions of turbulent burning rate are seemingly correct for flames lying within the wrinkled and corrugated flamelet regimes and for lower turbulence intensities, the findings cast doubt on the validity of the flamelet approximation for flames within the thin reaction zones regime.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Development of a High Resolution Microvascular Imaging Toolkit for Optical Coherence Tomography</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mariampillai, Adrian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents the development of new optical coherence tomography imaging systems and techniques to improve in vivo 3D microvascular imaging. Specifically these systems and techniques were proposed to address three main problems with 3D Doppler optical coherence tomography imaging: (a) Motion artefacts, (b) angle dependence of the signal, and (c) relatively high minimum detectable velocity of conventional color Doppler algorithms (~500 μm/s). In order to overcome these limitations a multi-pronged strategy was employed: (1) Construction of a retrospectively gated OCT system for the mitigation of periodic motion artefacts. Proof of principle in vivo B-mode imaging of Xenopus Laevis (embryo of African clawed frog) cardiovascular function up to 1000 frames per second (fps) from data acquired at 12 fps. Additionally, 4D imaging of the Xenopus Laevis heart at 45 volumes per second was demonstrated. (2) Construction of a Fourier domain mode locked laser for high speed swept source optical coherence tomography imaging. This laser was capable of reaching sweep rates of 67 kHz and was optimized to function in the SNR limited phase noise regimes upto approximately 55 dB structural SNR. (3) Development of a novel speckle variance image processing algorithm for velocity and angle independent 3D microvascular imaging. The velocity and angle independence of the technique was validated through phantom studies. iii In vivo demonstration of the speckle variance algorithm was performed by imaging the capillary network in the dorsal skin-fold window chamber model, with the results being validated using fluorescence confocal microscopy. In the final part of this thesis, these newly developed technologies were applied to the assessment of anti-vascular and anti-angiogenic therapies in preclinical models, specifically, photodynamic therapy and targeted degradation of HIF-α.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Novel Photonic Crystal Architectures for Optoelectronics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Puzzo, Daniel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The discovery of photonic crystals made over two decades ago sparked great excitement in the scientific community as this breakthrough brought with it the promise of novel and highly advanced photonic devices for a broad range of new technologies. Surprisingly, for a myriad of reasons, a few of which will be discussed in this thesis, little headway has been made in the development of commercial devices based on photonic crystals. Indeed, a disproportionate amount of research has been devoted to more fundamental studies and thus confined to the academic arena. In this thesis, we demonstrate the fabrication of novel bottom-up or combined bottom-up and top-down photonic crystals and demonstrate their integration into viable optoelectronic technologies. In particular, we highlight the fabrication of colloidal one-dimensional and three-dimensional photonic crystals with color reflectivity that is electrically tunable throughout the entire visible spectrum. In our methodology, a requisite material for the preparation of an electrically tunable one-dimensional photonic crystal, was a porous one-dimensional photonic crystal fabricated entirely from nanoparticles. We thus fabricated and highlight here the preparation of one-dimensional photonic crystals from various combinations of SiO2, TiO2, SnO2, and Sb:SnO2 (ATO) nanoparticles. We also demonstrate that these nanoparticle one-dimensional photonic crystals are also capable of serving as the resonator structure in organic dye and polymer based distributed feedback lasers. Finally, we also describe the fabrication of the first example of electrically conductive one-dimensional photonic crystals for optical wavelengths based entirely on conducting and optically transparent metal oxides. Owing to the conductivity and optical transparency of such materials, they are particularly well suited for serving simultaneously as the anode and mirror of a Light Emitting Diode microcavity for enhanced color purity.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Strong Interactions, Flavour Physics and Beyond</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zuberi, Saba</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis we use effective field theories of the strong interactions to improve our understanding of several quantities in the Standard Model of particle physics (SM). We also examine constraints on an extension of the SM scalar sector and study the implications for the Higgs mass. We first examine an approach to extracting the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element |Vub| via the relationship between the B meson decays B -&gt; Xu l nu and B -&gt; Xs gamma, where Xi is any final state hadron containing a quark of flavour i. Model dependence is reduced in this approach since the non-perturbative shape function at leading order is universal and drops out; however the perturbative expansion at next-to-leading order is found to be poorly behaved. We carry out a renormalon analysis of the relationship between these spectra to examine higher order perturbative corrections and compare the fixed-order and log expansions. Our analysis can be used to estimate the perturbative uncertainty in the extraction of |Vub|, which we show to be relatively small. Next we take a step towards the broader goal of summing large phase space logarithms from a variety of jet algorithms using Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). We develop a consistent approach to implementing arbitrary phase space constraints in SCET and demonstrate the connection between cutoffs in SCET and phase space limits. By considering several jet algorithms at next-to-leading order, we gain some insight into factorization of final state jets. In particular, we point out the connection between the ultraviolet regulator and factorization. Finally we consider a scalar sector that contains a colour-octet electroweak-doublet scalar, in addition to the SM Higgs. This extension contains the only scalar representations that Yukawa-couple to quarks and are consistent with minimal flavour violation. We examine constraints from electroweak precision data, direct production from LEPII and the Tevatron, and from flavour physics. We find both the Higgs and new scalars can be simultaneously light, with masses of O(100 GeV). The data also allows all the scalars to be heavy, with masses of O(1 TeV). The presence of the additional scalars removes the preference for a light Higgs, which normally emerges from fits to electroweak precision data.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Toward Multiplexed Nucleic Acid Assays and Biosensors Using Immobilized Quantum Dots as Donors in Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Algar, Walter Russell</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Research toward a multiplexed nucleic acid biosensor that uses quantum dots (QDs) as donors in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay is described. Optical fibers were modified with mixed films composed of different colours of QDs and different oligonucleotide probes that served as scaffolds for the hybridization of the corresponding target nucleic acid sequences. Fluorescent dyes that were suitable as acceptors for each QD donor were associated with hybridization and provided an analytical signal through FRET-sensitized emission. Different detection channels were achieved through the combination of different donors and acceptors: green emitting QDs with Cyanine 3 or Rhodamine Red-X; and red emitting QDs with Alexa Fluor 647. A detection channel that used the direct excitation of Pacific Blue complemented the FRET pairs. One-plex, two-plex, three-plex and four-plex hybridization assays were demonstrated. A sandwich assay format was adopted to avoid target labeling. Detection limits were 1-10 nM (1-12 pmol) and analysis times were 1-4 h. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were discriminated in multiplexed assays, and the potential for reusability was also demonstrated. Non-selective interactions between QDs and oligonucleotides were characterized, and routes toward the optimization of the QD-FRET hybridization assays were identified. A basic model for multiple FRET pathways in a mixed film was also developed. In addition to the advantages of solid-phase assays, the combination of QDs and FRET was advantageous because it permitted multiplexed detection using a single excitation source and a single substrate, in the ensemble, and via ratiometric signals. Spatial registration or sorting methods, imaging or spatial scanning, and single molecule spectroscopy were not required. The research in this thesis is expected to enable new chip-based biosensors in the future, and is an original contribution to both bioanalytical spectroscopy and the bioanalytical applications of nanomaterials.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dynamics of Carriers and Photoinjected Currents in Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Newson, Ryan William</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis reports results from the investigation of optically-induced carrier dynamics in graphite and graphitic carbon nanostructures. In this first set of experiments, the dynamics of photo-excited carriers in exfoliated graphene and thin graphitic films are studied by optical pump-probe spectroscopy. Samples ranging in thickness from 1 to 260 carbon layers are deposited onto an oxidized silicon substrate. Time-resolved reflectivity and transmissivity are measured at 1300 nm, following excitation by 150 fs, 800 nm pump pulses at room temperature. Two time scales are identified over which the extracted transient dielectric function returns to its quiescent value. A fast decay time of ~200 fs in graphene is associated with hot phonon emission and increases to ~300 fs for thicknesses greater than only a few carbon layers. The slow decay time, associated with hot phonon interaction and/or carrier recombination, increases more gradually, from ~2.5 to 5 ps over ~30 layers. A simple model suggests the thickness dependence of the slow decay time is likely a result of thermal diffusion into the substrate. In the second set of experiments, coherently-controlled two-colour injection photocurrents are generated via quantum interference of single- and two-photon absorption in bulk graphite and a variety of single-walled carbon nanotube samples, such as a CVD-grown aligned forest of nanotubes (tube diameter dt = 2.5 ± 1.5 nm), and both arc discharge (dt = 1.44 ± 0.15 nm) and HiPco (dt = 0.96 ± 0.14 nm) nanotube films separated by electronic type (metallic vs. semiconducting). At pump wavelengths of 1500 and 750 nm, the emitted terahertz radiation is used to estimate a peak current density of ~12 kA/cm² in graphite and a peak current of ~8 nA per nanotube. From the dependence of the injected current on pump polarization, the relative values of the current injection tensor elements are measured, and information is gained on the alignment and birefringence of the nanotube samples. The dependence of the injected current on pump wavelength implies that the currents are likely based on band-band electronic transitions and not on excitonic effects, which govern most linear optical processes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Stationary Waves in the Stratosphere-troposphere Circulation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wang, Lei</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Stationary wave theory elucidates the dynamics of the time mean zonally asymmetric component of the atmospheric circulation and separates it from the dynamics of the zonal mean climatological flow. This thesis focuses on the dynamics of stationary wave nonlinearity and its applications in stationary wave modelling and the stationary wave response to climate change. Stationary wave nonlinearity describes the self-interaction of stationary waves and is important in maintaining the observed zonally asymmetric atmospheric general circulation. Stationary wave nonlinearity is examined in quasi-geostrophic barotropic dynamics in both the presence and absence of transient waves. Stationary wave nonlinearity is shown to account for most of the difference between the linear and full nonlinear stationary waves, particularly if the zonal-mean flow adjustment to the stationary waves is taken into account. Wave activity analysis shows that stationary wave nonlinearity in this setting is associated with Rossby wave critical layer reflection. A time-integration type nonlinear stationary wave modelling technique is tested in this simple barotropic setting and is shown to be able to predict stationary wave nonlinearity and capture the basic features of the full nonlinear stationary wave. A baroclinic nonlinear stationary wave model is then developed using this technique and is applied to the problem of the stationary wave response to climate change. Previous stationary wave modelling has largely focused on the tropospheric circulation, but the stationary wave field extends into the stratosphere and plays an important dynamical role there. This stationary wave model is able to represent the stratospheric stationary wave field and is used to analyze the Northern Hemisphere stationary wave response to climate change simulated by the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM). In the CMAM simulation changes to the zonal mean basic state alone can explain much of the stationary wave response, which is largely controlled by changes of the zonal mean circulation in the Northern Hemisphere subtropical upper troposphere. However, details of the stratospheric wave driving response are also sensitive to other aspects of the zonal-mean response and to the heating response.

          <dc:title>Dynamic Interleaved Imaging of Pyruvate Metabolism with Hyperpolarized 13C</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Leung, Kevin Kai-Chi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Dynamic nuclear polarization and dissolution of 13C-labeled metabolite allows dynamic imaging of metabolism in-vivo. However, the spatial and temporal resolutions of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging are limited by the duration of free-induction decay acquisitions and the T1-based, non-recoverable polarization decay. This thesis describes the implementation of a spectral-spatial radiofrequency excitation pulse with a `flyback' echo-planar readout trajectory to dynamically image [1-13C]-pyruvate and [1-13C]-lactate in an interleaved manner. This technique excites a single resonance of either [1-13C]-pyruvate or [1-13C]-lactate and generates dynamic images with 5mm in-plane resolution. Metabolite dynamics extracted from the images and the corresponding non-localized spectroscopic data reveal similar kinetic rates upon fitting to a kinetic model. This demonstrates the feasibility of probing metabolism in heterogeneous tissues in-vivo with dynamic interleaved 13C MR imaging.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Karimelahi, Samira</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Preliminary investigations were carried out in order to explore the potential of laser-stimulated capillary growth in a blood vessel-on-a-chip. To fulfill the project objective, a series of experiments in both directions of two photon fluorescence imaging and laser-semitransparent materials interaction were performed. A purpose-built two-photon fluorescence imaging resolution was tested by imaging 1 micron diameter fluorescent beads. Also, the potential of fluorescence imaging in the waveguide writing eld as well as the biological eld was studied. Further, for laser ablation on the mouse artery loaded in the microfluidic channel, the processing window was found such that the damage induced by femtosecond laser just a effects the artery, not the other interfaces of the microfluidic chip. At the end, the result of laser trepanning on the mouse artery wall combined with two photon fluorescence imaging was shown. These results will be useful for more advanced biological study such as angiogenesis.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Aerosol Characterization and Analytical Modeling of Concentric Pneumatic and Flow Focusing Nebulizers for Sample Introduction</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kashani, Arash</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A concentric pneumatic nebulizer (CPN) and a custom designed flow focusing nebulizer (FFN) are characterized. As will be shown, the classical Nukiyama-Tanasawa and Rizk-Lefebvre models lead to erroneous size prediction for the concentric nebulizer under typical operating conditions due to its specific design, geometry, dimension and different flow regimes. The models are then modified to improve the agreement with the experimental results. The size prediction of the modified models together with the spray velocity characterization are used to determine the overall nebulizer efficiency and also employed as input to a new Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) based model to predict joint size-velocity distribution analytically. The new MEP model is exploited to study the local variation of size-velocity distribution in contrast to the classical models where MEP is applied globally to the entire spray cross section. As will be demonstrated, the velocity distribution of the classical MEP models shows poor agreement with experiments for the cases under study. Modifications to the original MEP modeling are proposed to overcome this deficiency. In addition, the new joint size-velocity distribution agrees better with our general understanding of the drag law and yields realistic results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Investigation of Coherence and its Decay Mechanisms in an Optical Lattice</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Maneshi, Samansa</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, I report on experiments with cold 85Rb atoms in a far-detuned one-dimensional optical lattice. These experiments are focused on creating efficient coupling between the quantized vibrational states of atoms in the optical lattice, on controlling and maintaining coherence between the vibrational states, and on developing a spectroscopy method to characterize the decay of coherence. First, I present an experimental study of the application of simple and compound pulses consisting of time-dependent spatial translations to coupling vibrational states of ultracold 85Rb atoms in the optical lattice. Experimental results show that a square pulse consisting of lattice displacements and a delay is more efficient than single-step and Gaussian pulses. The square pulse can be seen as an example of coherent control. Numerical calculations are in strong agreement with the experimental results. In addition, it is shown numerically that the vibrational state coupling due to such lattice manipulations is more efficient in shallow lattices than in deep lattices, in which the coupling probability approaches the harmonic oscillator limit. Next, the effectiveness of these pulses in reviving oscillations of atoms in vibrational superposition states using a pulse-echo technique is examined. Experimental results show that the square and Gaussian pulses result in higher echo amplitudes than the single-step pulse. These echo amplitudes are an order of magnitude larger than the echo amplitudes observed previously for the motional states of atoms in optical lattices. With the aim of the optimized square echo pulse, echo amplitude is measured at much longer times, where a surprising coherence freeze (plateau) is observed. To investigate mechanisms responsible for the observed echo decay and the coherence freeze, we developed a new two-dimensional pump-probe spectroscopy technique to monitor the evolution of frequency-frequency correlations in the system, a necessary input for understanding the decay of coherence. Through this 2D technique, we have characterized the temporal decay of frequency memory and through our simulations we find that coherence freeze is related to the shape of this memory loss function. This technique is general in that it can be applied in a variety of quantum information candidate systems to probe the nature of their decoherence.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Extended Fluid-dynamic Modelling for Numerical Solution of Micro-Scale Flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>McDonald, James Gerald</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This study is concerned with the development of extended fluid-dynamic models for the prediction of micro-scale flows. When compared to classical fluid descriptions, such models must remain valid on scales where traditional techniques fail. Also, knowing that solution to these equations will be sought by numerical methods, the nature of the extended models must also be such that they are amenable to solution using computational techniques. Moment closures of kinetic theory offer the promise of satisfying both of these requirements. It is shown that the hyperbolic nature of moment equations imbue them with several numerical advantages including an extra order of spacial accuracy for a given reconstuction when compared to the Navier-Stokes equations and a reduced sensitivity to grid irregularities. In addition to this, the expanded set of parameters governed by the moment closures allow them to accurately model many strong non-equilibrium effects that are typical of micro-scale flows. Unfortunately, traditional moment models have suffered from various closure breakdowns, and robust models that offer a treatment for non-equilibrium viscous heat-conducting gas flows have been elusive. To address these issues, a regularized 10-moment closure is first proposed herein based on the maximum-entropy Gaussian moment closure. This mathematically well-behaved model avoids closure breakdown through a strictly hyperbolic treatment for viscous effects and an elliptic formulation that accounts for non-equilibrium thermal diffusion. Moreover, steps toward the development of fully hyperbolic moment closures for the prediction of non-equilibrium viscous gas flow are made via two novel approaches. A thorough study of each of the proposed techniques is made through numerical solution of many classical flow problems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Realization of Bose-Einstein Condensation of 87Rb in a Time-orbiting Potential Trap</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Siercke, Mirco</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The construction of an apparatus capable of producing Bose-Einstein condensates marks a significant milestone in every experimental cold atom laboratory. In this thesis I describe the development of a system to create a Bose-Einstein condensate of $^{87}Rb$ in a Time-Orbiting Potential trap. I review the optical and magnetic techniques required to trap and cool an atomic sample under vacuum, motivating our decision to build a double MOT system comprised of a high-pressure ($10^{-9}$ torr) chamber to gather atoms and a low-pressure ($10^{-11}$ torr) chamber to cool atoms to degeneracy. By theoretically modeling the atom number and temperature inside the magnetic trap during evaporative cooling I demonstrate a simple approach to determining a cooling path that reaches the transition temperature. By making use of the condensates produced under these non-optimized conditions I determine the heating rate of the condensate in the TOP trap to be $300$ nK/s. I further use the condensates to make a more precise measurement of the TOP trap bias field. I improve upon the conventional evaporation path used in TOP trap experiments by introducing and optimizing additional bias field compression stages in between RF evaporation ramps. I demonstrate how, by adding these additional stages, the system is capable of reaching the BEC phase transition with a final atom number of $2\times 10^{5}$. In contrast, RF evaporation after only a single bias field ramp has yielded condensates with only $30\times 10^3$ atoms.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical Modeling of Wave Propagation in Strip Lines with Gyrotropic Magnetic Substrate and Magnetostaic Waves</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Vashghani Farahani, Alireza</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Simulating wave propagation in microstrip lines with Gyrotropic magnetic substrate is considered in this thesis. Since the static internal field distribution has an important effect on the device behavior, accurate determination of the internal fields are considered as well. To avoid the losses at microwave frequencies it is assumed that the magnetic substrate is saturated in the direction of local internal field. An iterative method to obtain the magnetization distribution has been developed. It is applied to a variety of nonlinear nonuniform magnetic material configurations that one may encounter in the design stage, subject to a nonuniform applied field. One of the main characteristics of the proposed iterative method to obtain the static internal field is that the results are supported by a uniqueness theorem in magnetostatics. The series of solutions Mn,Hn, where n is the iteration number, minimize the free Gibbs energy G(M) in sequence. They also satisfy the constitutive equation M = χH at the end of each iteration better than the previous one. Therefore based on the given uniqueness theorem, the unique stable equilibrium state M is determined. To simulate wave propagation in the Gyrotropic magnetic media a new FDTD formulation is proposed. The proposed formulation considers the static part of the electromagnetic field, obtained by using the iterative approach, as parameters and updates the dynamic parts in time. It solves the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in consistency with Maxwell’s equations in time domain. The stability of the initial static field distribution ensures that the superposition of the time varying parts due to the propagating wave will not destabilize the code. Resonances in a cavity filled with YIG are obtained. Wave propagation through a microstrip line with YIG substrate is simulated. Magnetization oscillations around local internal field are visualized. It is proved that the excitation of magnetization precession which is accompanied by the excitation of magnetostatic waves is responsible for the gap in the scattering parameter S12. Key characteristics of the wide microstrip lines are verified in a full wave FDTD simulation. These characteristics are utilized in a variety of nonreciprocal devices like edgemode isolators and phase shifters.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Use of End Plates for a Cylinder in the Sub-critical Flow Regime</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Blackmore, Adam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Experiments were conducted in a free-surface, re-circulating water channel to determine the dependence of spanwise flow uniformity in the near wake of a circular cylinder on the end conditions using Particle Image Velocimetry. The Reynolds number was 10,000. The end conditions consisted of plates with different leading edge geometries and configurations. A cylinder bounded by two endplates with sharp leading edge geometry generated the most uniform near wake. The horseshoe vortex dynamics in the cylinder/ wall and cylinder/endplate junctions were also studied. Upstream flow separation significantly altered the behavior of the horse shoe vortices. Periodic horse shoe vortex oscillation was found for experiments with the upstream flow attached; this periodic oscillation was disrupted with the presence of upstream flow separation. The endplate leading edge distance was also investigated. The oscillation frequency of the horse shoe vortex system was found to decrease with increasing leading edge distance.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fabrication of Photonic Crystal Optofluidic Devices for Electrochromatography and Spectroscopy on a Chip</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Haque, Moez</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Femtosecond laser processes were optimized for nonlinear interactions with optical materials to develop a novel biophotonic lab-on-a-chip device that integrates laser-formed waveguides, microfluidic channels and photonic crystals (PCs). Such integration seeks the novel demonstration of dual PC functionalities: (1) efficient chromatographic separation and filtration of analytes through a porous PC embedded inside a microfluidic channel and (2) optofluidic spectroscopy through embedded waveguides that probe PC stop band shifts as varying analyte concentrations flow and separate. The building blocks for such integration were demonstrated through the accelerated analyte flow rates measured through the embedded porous PC and the optical characterization of a PC’s stop band via integrated waveguides. Together, these laboratory results give promise for achieving simultaneous chromatographic and spectroscopic capabilities in a single PC optofluidic device. Future improvements in the laser process and possible new research directions are also offered.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Burst-train Generation for Femtosecond Laser Filamentation-driven Micromachining</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rezaei, Saeid</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Bursts of femtosecond laser pulses with a repetition rate of 38.5MHz were created by integrating a purpose-built burst resonator system with a Ti: Sapphire laser system. The timing control system in this work provided flexibility for generation of any desirable pulse train profile in the burst envelope. These laser pulses further have been used for high aspect ratio hole drilling inside glass materials. High repetition rate of the pulses produces heat accumulation effects during the laser machining interaction which provided the possibility of deeper etching, increased the aspect ratio, and mitigated cracks and damages effects of single pulses. During the process, time-resolved nanosecond scale side-view images have been recorded with a time-gated intensified-CCD camera enabling the observation of transient effects during the laser machining process. These side-view images further have been used to assess the physics of burst interaction and illustrate benefits and disadvantages of high repetition rate laser pulses.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Extending Plasmonics in Semiconductors to Higher Operating Frequencies</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wong, Herman Man Kai</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis examines the feasibility of using conventional semiconductors, specifically GaAs, as a plasmonic material at the operating wavelength of 1550nm, due to its many merits such as achievable low losses and mature micro-fabrication technologies. A theoretical study is performed on GaAs that yielded the condition for plasmonic behaviour at a minimum free carrier density of 7.2 x 10^20cm^-3 in bulk materials. The most feasible route to achieving this condition is determined to be intense optical excitation, and the required intensity considering a 150fs pulse at the above bandgap wavelength of 870nm is approximately 2.55TW/cm^2. A Bragg reflection ridge waveguide (BRW) using GaAs-AlGaAs is designed and micro-fabricated, and a counter-propagating pump-probe experiment is devised to test the plasmonic effect using the BRW. Results from two different ultrafast lasers include the observation of pump (870nm and 800nm) coupling to fundamental Bragg modes, and the measurement of the pump transmission spectrum.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Phase-matching Second-order Optical Nonlinear Interactions using Bragg Reflection Waveguides: A Platform for Integrated Parametric Devices</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Abolghasem, Payam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Bragg reflection waveguides (BRW) or one-dimensional photonic bandgap structures have been demonstrated for phase-matching chi(2) nonlinearities in AlxGa1-xAs. The method exploits strong modal dispersion of a Bragg mode and total internal reflection modes co-propagating inside the waveguide. It is shown that phase-matching is attained among the lowest order modes of interacting harmonics, which allows maximizing the utilization of harmonics powers for nonlinear interactions. As our first demonstration, we report second-harmonic generation (SHG) of a 2-ps telecommunication pump in a 2.4 mm long slab BRW. The conversion efficiency is estimated as 2.0 %/W.cm^2 with a generated SH power of 729 nW. This efficiency has been considerably improved by introducing lateral confinement of optical modes in ridge structures. Characterizations denote that efficiency of SHG in ridge BRWs can increase by over an order of magnitude in comparison to that of the slab device. Also, we report continuous-wave SHG in BRWs. Using a telecommunication pump with a power of 98 mW, the continuous-wave SH power of 23 nW is measured in a 2.0 mm long device. Significant enhancements of chi(2) interactions is obtained in the modified design of matching-layer enhanced BRW (ML-BRW). For the first time, we report type-II SHG in ML-BRW, where the second-harmonic power of 60 µW is measured for a pump power of 3.3 mW in a 2.2 mm long sample. Also, we demonstrate the existence of type-0 SHG, where both pump and SH signal have an identical TM polarization state. It is shown that the efficiency of the type-0 process is comparable to type-I and type-II processes with the phase-matching wavelengths of all three interactions lying within a spectral window as small as 17 nm. ML-BRW is further reported for sum-frequency and difference-frequency generations. For applications requiring high pump power, a generalized ML-BRW design is proposed and demonstrated. The proposed structure offsets the destructive effects of third-order nonlinearities on chi(2) processes when high power harmonics are involved. This is carried out through incorporation of larger bandgap materials by using high aluminum content AlxGa1-xAs layers without undermining the nonlinear conversion efficiency. Theoretical investigations of BRWs as integrated sources of photon-pairs with frequency correlation properties are discussed. It is shown that the versatile dispersion properties in BRWs enables generation of telecommunication anti-correlated photon-pairs with bandwidth tunablity between 1 nm and 450 nm.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Monolithic Integration of Active and Second-order Nonlinear Functionality in Bragg Reflection Waveguides</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bijlani, Bhavin J.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis explored the theory, design, fabrication and characterization of AlGaAs Bragg reflection waveguides (BRW) towards the goal of a platform for monolithic integration of active and optically nonlinear devices. Through integration of a diode laser and nonlinear phase-matched cavity, the possibility of on-chip nonlinear frequency generation was explored. Such integrated devices would be highly useful as a robust, alignment free, small footprint and electrically injected alternative to bulk optic systems. A theoretical framework for modal analysis of arbitrary 1-D photonic crystal defect waveguides is developed. This method relies on the transverse resonance condition. It is then demonstrated in the context of several types of Bragg reflection waveguides. The framework is then extended to phase-match second-order nonlinearities and incorporating quantum-wells for diode lasers. Experiments within a slab and ridge waveguide demonstrated phase-matched Type-I second harmonic generation at fundamental wavelength of 1587 and 1600 nm, respectively; a first for this type of waveguide. For the slab waveguide, conversion efficiency was 0.1 %/W. In the more strongly confined ridge waveguides, efficiency increased to 8.6 %/W owing to the increased intensity. The normalized conversion efficiency was estimated to be at 600 %/Wcm^2. Diode lasers emitting at 980 nm in the BRW mode were also fabricated. Verification of the Bragg mode was performed through imaging the near- field of the mode. Propagation loss of this type of mode was measured directly for the first time at 14 cm^-1. The lasers were found to be very insensitive with characteristic temperature at 215 K. Two designs incorporating both laser and phase-matched nonlinearity within the same cavity were fabricated, for degenerate and non-degenerate down-conversion. Though the lasers were sub-optimal, a parametric fluorescence signal was readily detected. Fluorescence power as high as 4 nW for the degenerate design and 5 nW for the non-degenerate design were detected. The conversion efficiency was 4176 %/Wcm^2 and 874 %/Wcm^2, respectively. Neither design was found to emit near the design wavelength. In general, the signal is between 1600-1800 nm and the idler is between 2200-2400 nm. Improvements in laser performance are expected to drastically increase the conversion efficiency.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Investigating Seismic Wave Scattering in Heterogeneous Environments and Implications for Seismic Imaging</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bongajum, Emmanuel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Inhomogeneities in the earth (fractures, layering, shape, composition) are responsible for seismic wave scattering and contribute towards amplitude, travel time, frequency and spectral fluctuations observed in seismic records. This thesis presents findings that complement our understanding of seismic scattering and imaging in heterogeneous media. Interest focused on probing the correlation between spatial variations in attributes that characterize the state (physical, chemical) of rocks and seismic waveform data with consideration towards potential implications for seismic survey design to optimize imaging, imaging with converted waves, microseismic monitoring, velocity modeling and imaging of lithological boundaries. The highlights of the research strategy include: • The use of stochastic methods to build realistic earth models that characterize the 1D, 2D and 3D spatial variations in rock properties. These petrophysical earth models are conditioned by experimental (“hard”) data such as geology, wave velocities and density from case study areas like the Bosumtwi impact crater and the base metal deposits in Nash Creek (Canada) and Thompson (Canada). The distributions of the sulfide mineralization at Nash Creek and at Thompson represent two end members of the heterogeneity spectrum. While the sulfide mineralization at Nash Creek is highly disseminated in nature, the sulfide rich zones at Thompson occur as well defined volumes (lens-shaped) having a strong density contrast with respect to the host rocks. • Analysis of modeled forward (transmitted) and backward scattered wave propagation in the heterogeneous earth models. As a result of a study aimed at correlating resonant frequencies to scale length parameters, it is observed that the efficiency of the spectral ratio method is undermined by its sensitivity to the interference between P- and S-waves as well as the impedance contrast. It is also demonstrated that travel time of direct arrivals (transmitted waves) can be used to infer structural heterogeneity and velocity distribution beyond borehole locations. However, the success of imaging with transmitted waves is subject to the influence of geology which must factor in the choice of acquisition geometry. For the first time, multivariate and multidimensional (3D) heterogeneous earth models that are conditioned by hard data from multiple boreholes are constructed. The methodology requires having at least one physical rock property attribute that is sampled along the whole borehole length. This approach helped to characterize the uncertainty in the distribution of rock densities and metal content in a study region of the Nash Creek property. The density data suggests the sulfides are disseminated and this poses challenges for both gravity and seismic imaging methods. Modeling studies suggest seismic methods will not be suited for imaging zones with such disseminated mineralization. On the other hand, when dealing with massive sulfide mineralization that has complex geology (steep dip) like the case in Thompson, the success of the seismic imaging process relies very much on the acquisition geometry as well as the variability of the physical properties of the host rock. Elastic modeling results show that a Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP) geometry is better suited to capture the down-dip scattered wavefield from the orebody. While surface acquisition geometry with sufficient extended length in the down dip direction can also be used to detect the dipping orebody, its efficiency can however be undermined by background heterogeneity: when the scale length along the direction of dip is comparable to the dimensions of the orebody, the scattered wavefields are strong enough to mask the diffraction hyperbola generated from the ore. Moreover, the study also corroborates that converted waves generated from the scattering processes hold promise as an imaging tool for a dipping orebody as they are least affected by the scattering processes of background heterogeneity.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Investigation of Rare Earth Silicide and Alkaline Earth Fluoride Nanostructures on Silicon(001) Surfaces</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cui, Yan Jr.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Many low dimensional structures arise from self-assembly when depositing metals on silicon surfaces, including both quantum dots and quantum wires. One class of these objects are rare earth silicide nanowires (RENW) grown on Si(001). In this dissertation, NW thermal stability, control of NW cross section, and associated surface reconstructions are studied by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). We test thulium and find for the first time that it forms NWs and these NWs are stable against prolonged annealing. We also find that the RENWs nucleate at 2×7 reconstruction domain boundaries. These results pave the way for precise control over NW size, placement, and integration with functional nanostructures and nanodevices.Another type of self-assembled NWs on Si(001) are insulating CaF2 NWs. As an ideal model system for epitaxial growth of an insulator on a semiconductor surface, CaF2 offers unique properties such as simple structure, good lattice match to silicon and congruent evaporation. In this thesis the growth behavior of CaF2 on the Si(001) surface is investigated. At low coverages CaF2 molecules randomly locate on Si(001). Features observed at this stage are explained in terms of dissociated fragments of CaF2 terminating the dangling bonds of Si dimers. Etching is observed after surface is saturated by these features with a 2×1 periodicity. A 2×n phase, grown at 750°C, suggests the dissociation of CaF2, as proved by the simulation of LEED patterns. A c(4×4) phase is observed from 0.5ML to about 1ML with deposition temperature from 600oC to 700oC. At the highest CaF2 deposition coverages studied, a stripe phase and CaF2 NWs are observed by a combination of STM, AFM and SEM. The results provide a significant expansion in the knowledge of CaF2 on Si(001). The common thread that links all these studies is the extent to which nanostructures can be controlled by careful growth conditions, not just by substrate temperature and the amount of material deposited, but also by timing of post-deposition annealing, etc. The grown nanostructures are metastable and result from a balance of energetic considerations and kinetics.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>R-symmetry, Gauge Mediation and Decaying Dark Matter</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>De Lope Amigo, Santiago José</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Different aspects of specific models in supersymmetry as well as constraints on decaying dark matter are analysed in this thesis. In chapter 1 we give a general introduction to supersymmetry, and briefly discuss some of the concepts that are used throughout the thesis. In chapter 2 we present a version of Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking which preserves an $R$-symmetry---the gauginos are Dirac particles, the $A$-terms are zero, and there are four Higgs doublets. This offers an alternative way for gauginos to acquire mass in the supersymmetry-breaking models of Intriligator, Seiberg, and Shih \cite{Intriligator:2006dd} . Additionally, we investigate the possibility of using $R$-symmetric gauge mediation to realise the spectrum and large sfermion mixing of the model of Kribs, Poppitz, and Weiner \cite{Kribs:2007ac}. In chapter 3 we investigate the Higgs sector of the $R$-symmetric model presented in chapter 2. Furthermore, a scan of the parameter space and sample spectra are provided. Other attributes like the tuning of the model are discussed. In chapter 4 we present a complete analysis of the cosmological constraints on decaying dark matter. In order to do this, we have updated and extended previous analyses to include Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, large scale structure, and weak lensing observations. Astrophysical constraints are not considered in this thesis. The bounds on the lifetime of decaying dark matter are dominated by either the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect for the scenario with weak reionization, or CMB polarisation observations when there is significant reionization. For the respective scenarios, the lifetimes for decaying dark matter are $\Gamma^{-1} \gtrsim 100$ Gyr and $ (f \Gamma) ^{-1} \gtrsim 5.3 \times 10^8$ Gyr (at 95.4\% confidence level), where the phenomenological parameter $f$ is the fraction of the decay energy deposited in baryonic gas. This allows us to constrain particle physics models with dark matter candidates through investigation of dark matter decays into Standard Model particles via effective operators. For decaying dark matter of $\sim 100$ GeV mass, we found that the size of the coupling constant in the effective dimension-4 operators responsible for dark matter decay has to generically be $ \lesssim 10^{-22}$.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Bose-Einstein Condensate Wavefunction Reconstruction Through Collisions with Optical Potentials</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ellenor, Christopher William</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A new technique for the interferometric measurement of an atomic wavefunction is introduced theoretically, which is able to extract phase and amplitude information in a single measurement. I focus on the application of this technique to the single-particle wavefunction of a Bose condensed cloud of rubidium atoms. The technique differs from existing techniques mainly in its simplicity, as it requires only a single laser beam to be added to a typical Bose-Einstein condensation apparatus. A second novel aspect is the consideration of condensate collisions with an optical potential in the low-intensity limit where the potential barrier may be viewed as a phase mask. The technique is then demonstrated experimentally. A related effect, the transient enhancement of momentum during a collision, first predicted by JG Muga et al., has also been demonstrated. Finally, significant redesign and construction of an apparatus to produce condensates of 87Rb is documented. The main result of this work is the production of pure condensates of up to 150k atoms which can be repeated every 45s. A calibration technique is devised and demonstrated, whereby copies of the condensate are made, and the copies are used to reduce the centre-of-mass momentum uncertainty of the interacting cloud by a factor of five.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Charge Transfer Processes in the Excited Dynamics of II-VI Semiconductor Nanocrystals</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lo, Shun</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In large molecular systems such as DNA, supramolecular complexes and dendrimers, functional groups located at different parts of the molecular structure can act as charge donors or acceptors, and photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer can occur. An analogous scenario can be found in colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, most evident in type-II heterostructures, where the relative band-alignment of the constituent materials are in a stagger configuration. Such a configuration, provides an energetically favourable situation for an photo-generated electron to be transferred from one material to the other, confining the electron and the hole in different domains of the nanostructure. A less obvious scenario in nanocrystals is when the core is thought of as the donor group, and the surface as the acceptor group. In such a scenario, the localization of electron or hole at surface defect sites, a process that occurs in every nanocrystal, can be thought of as an ``intramolecular" charge transfer. The studies presented in this dissertation are an attempt to further understand charge transfer processes in semiconductor nanostructures, in particular, those occurring within the same nanocrystals. This is carried out by a combination of spectroscopic techniques and modelling. First, time-resolved fluorescence measurements are used to investigated surface trapping/de-trapping dynamics in CdSe and CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell quantum dots. A kinetic model, in which trapping/de-trapping is described with Marcus' classical electron transfer theory, is used to analyzed our results, yielding excellent agreement between model and experiment. Second, the influence of temperature and solvent environment in the optical spectra of CdSe/CdTe nanorods are examined. Solvatochromic shifts in these heterostructures are found to be larger than those observed in core-only quantum dots. Finally, ultrafast dynamics and biexciton states in CdSe/CdTe quantum dots are probed using two-dimensional optical spectroscopy. The fine structure of the lowest exciton and biexciton states are calculated for a model system with type-II band-alignment and simulations of 2D spectra are performed.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The lateral spatial separation between the circular polarization components of a linearly polarized light beam impinging at off-normal incidence on an air-semiconductor interface is investigated experimentally and theoretically. This fundamental optical phenomenon is referred to as the Spin Hall effect of light (SHEL). An optical pump-probe technique is demonstrated to resolve in situ the nanometer size SHEL displacement of a beam transmitted inside an absorptive material. Three different types of optical interactions in silicon and GaAs demonstrate the technique’s general applicability. First, resonant ∼150 fs pump and probe pulses at λ = 820 nm resolve the SHEL displacement via free-carrier absorption in a 10 μm thick silicon sample. The measured SHEL displacements for a p-polarized probe beam are obtained between −10 to 150 nm as a function of the angle of incidence on the sample. Different angles of incidence are achieved by keeping a fixed angular separation between the pump and the probe beams while rotating the sample about the axis perpendicular to the plane of incidence. In another experiment, an optically thin (500 nm thick) GaAs sample allows one to use Pauli-blocking as an optical interaction to investigate the polarization and angular dependence of the SHEL in the probe beam. For such a polarization-dependent imaging technique, the SHEL displacement in the pump beam also contributes to the measured signal and is evaluated experimentally. A probe beam at normal incidence is used to measure a SHEL displacement of ∼180 nm in a transmitted p-polarized pump beam impinging on the sample with an angle of incidence of 55 degrees. Finally, two-photon absorption is used to resolve the SHEL in a (001) oriented 500 μm thick GaAs wafer using an optical source generating sub-bandgap radiation (λ = 1550 nm) with a pulse duration of 120 fs. Linearly p- and s- co-polarized pump and probe beams are also used to investigate the polarization dependence of the SHEL. All the experimental results obtained using these different optical interactions agree with the theory within the experimental error. Finally, analytical expressions of the shifts experienced by the circular components of a beam impinging at an interface between two optical media are also derived for an incident beam with an arbitrary spatial distribution.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Magneto-hydrodynamics Simulation in Astrophysics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pang, Bijia</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) studies the dynamics of an electrically conducting fluid under the influence of a magnetic field. Many astrophysical phenomena are related to MHD, and computer simulations are used to model these dynamics. In this thesis, we conduct MHD simulations of non-radiative black hole accretion as well as fast magnetic reconnection. By performing large scale three dimensional parallel MHD simulations on supercomputers and using a deformed-mesh algorithm, we were able to conduct very high dynamical range simulations of black hole accretion of Sgr A* at the Galactic Center. We find a generic set of solutions, and make specific predictions for currently feasible observations of rotation measure (RM). The magnetized accretion flow is subsonic and lacks outward convection flux, making the accretion rate very small and having a density slope of around $-1$. There is no tendency for the flows to become rotationally supported, and the slow time variability of the RM is a key quantitative signature of this accretion flow. We also provide a constructive numerical example of fast magnetic reconnection in a three-dimensional periodic box. Reconnection is initiated by a strong, localized perturbation to the field lines and the solution is intrinsically three-dimensional. Approximately $30\%$ of the magnetic energy is released in an event which lasts about one Alfv\'en time, but only after a delay during which the field lines evolve into a critical configuration. In the co-moving frame of the reconnection regions, reconnection occurs through an X-like point, analogous to the Petschek reconnection. The dynamics appear to be driven by global flows rather than local processes. In addition to issues pertaining to physics, we present results on the acceleration of MHD simulations using heterogeneous computing systems \cite{shan2006heterogeneous}. We have implemented the MHD code on a variety of heterogeneous and multi-core architectures (multi-core x86, Cell, Nvidia and ATI GPU) using different languages (FORTRAN, C, Cell, CUDA and OpenCL). Initial performance results for these systems are presented, and we conclude that substantial gains in performance over traditional systems are possible. In particular, it is possible to extract a greater percentage of peak theoretical performance from some heterogeneous systems when compared to x86 architectures.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Polymer Conformational Changes under Pressure Driven Compressible Flow in Nanofluidic Channels</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Raghu, Riyad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A hybrid molecular dynamics/multiparticle collision dynamics algorithm was constructed to model the pressure-driven flow of a compressible fluid through a nanoscopic channel of square cross-sectional area, as well as the effect of this flow on the configuration of a polymer chain that was tethered to the surface of this nanochannel. In the process of simulating channel flow, a new adiabatic partial slip boundary condition was created as well as a modified source/sink inlet and outlet boundary condition that could maintain a specified pressure gradient across the channel without the large entrance effects typically associated with these algorithms. The results of the flow simulations were contrasted with the results from a series solution to the Navier-Stokes equation for isothermal compressible flow, and showed excellent agreement with the results from the series solution when slip-boundary conditions were applied. A finitely extendible non-linear elastic spring and bead polymer chain was used to simulate the effect of flow on the polymer chain configuration under poor solvent and θ solvent conditions. Under θ solvent conditions, the cyclical dynamics that have been previousy observed for tethered polymer chains in pure shear flows were noted, however they were restricted to the end of the polymer chain. Under poor solvent conditions, the polymer adopted a metastable helix configuration as it collapsed to a globule state. The study also examined interchain and intrachain entanglements in polymers using the granny knot and overhand knot. The mechanisms by which these tangles untied themselves were determined. At low flow rates, the tangles unravelled by the end of the chain migrating through the loops of the tangle. At high flow rates, the tangles behaved like an entrained object as they reptated towards the end of the chain.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Ultrafast Active Plasmonics on Gold Films</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rotenberg, Nir</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Active plasmonics combines the manipulation of light on both sub-wavelength length and ultrashort time scales, a unique meld that holds promise for developments in many scientific fields. This thesis reports on a novel approach to ultrafast, all-optical control of grating-assisted excitation of surface plasmon polaritons based on opto-thermally modifying the optical properties of gold. In contrast to prior works, this approach results in plasmonic modulation on picosecond and even sub-picosecond time scales, and is compatible with modern, multi-GHz information processing technology. Finally, an analytic model is developed that allows for the rapid and accurate calculation of the coupling efficiency of beams with arbitrary spatial profile. First, the ultrafast dynamics of existing plasmonic coupling resonances, on gold films with grating overlayers, are studied with spectrally resolved pump-probe measurements. Irradiation of the metal by 700 fs, 775 nm laser pulses results in modulations of the plasmonic coupling efficiency of ~20% near the center, or ~60% off-center, of resonances centered between 540 nm and 700 nm. The modulations decay with a time constant of 770 +/- 70 fs. The experimental results are consistent with simulations based on the thermal-dynamics of the electron-lattice gold system, coupled with numerical modeling of light-grating interactions. Next, two 150 fs, 810 nm laser beams are interfered on the surface of a planar gold film, leading to an absorption/refraction grating in the metal. Optical pump-probe spectroscopy measurements of the first (-1) diffracted order in transmission identify plasmonic coupling resonances between 520 nm and 570 nm. The observed coupling efficiency is ~10^{-5}, and the launch window decays with a time constant of 620 +/- 100 fs. Lastly, a Green function-based analytic model is developed to describe grating assisted plasmonic coupling, culminating in a first-order differential equation with coefficients that have both clear physical significance as well as analytic forms. Comparison of this technique with standard numerical modeling methods shows that plasmonic coupling efficiencies in excess of 0.8 are predicted within an error of 15%. This model is used to study plasmonic excitation by finite-size beams, showing the spatial evolution of the intensity of both the surface plasmon polariton and the reflected beam.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>On the Squeezing and Over-squeezing of Photons</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Shalm, Lynden Krister</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Quantum mechanics allows us to use nonclassical states of light to make measurements with a greater precision than comparable classical states. Here an experiment is presented that squeezes the polarization state of three photons. We demonstrate the deep connection that exists between squeezing and entanglement, unifying the squeezed state and multi-photon entangled state approaches to quantum metrology. For the first time we observe the phenomenon of over-squeezing where a system is squeezed to the point that further squeezing leads to a counter-intuitive increase in measurement uncertainty. Quasi-probability distributions on the surface of a Poincaré sphere are the most natural way to represent the topology of our polarization states. Using this representation it is easy to observe the squeezing and over-squeezing behaviour of our photon states. Work is also presented on two different technologies for generating nonclassical states of light. The first is based on the nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric downconversion to produce pairs of photons. With this source up to 200,000 pairs of photons/s have been collected into single-mode fibre, and over 100 double pairs/s have been detected. This downconversion source is suitable for use in a wide variety of multi-qubit quantum information applications. The second source presented is a single-photon source based on semiconductor quantum dots. The single-photon character of the source is verified using a Hanbury Brown-Twiss interferometer.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Wavelength Conversion in Domain-disordered Quasi-phase Matching Superlattice Waveguides</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wagner, Sean</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis examines second-order optical nonlinear wave mixing processes in domain-disordered quasi-phase matching waveguides and evaluates their potential use in compact, monolithically integrated wavelength conversion devices. The devices are based on a GaAs/AlGaAs superlattice-core waveguide structure with an improved design over previous generations. Quantum-well intermixing by ion-implantation is used to create the quasi-phase matching gratings in which the nonlinear susceptibility is periodically suppressed. Photoluminescence experiments showed a large band gap energy blue shift around 70 nm after intermixing. Measured two-photon absorption coefficients showed a significant polarization dependence and suppression of up to 80% after intermixing. Similar polarization dependencies and suppression were observed in three-photon absorption and nonlinear refraction. Advanced modeling of second-harmonic generation showed reductions of over 50% in efficiency due to linear losses alone. Self-phase modulation was found to be the dominant parasitic nonlinear effect on the conversion efficiency, with reductions of over 60%. Simulations of group velocity mismatch showed modest reductions in efficiency of less than 10%. Experiments on second-harmonic generation showed improvements in efficiency over previous generations due to low linear loss and improved intermixing. The improvements permitted demonstration of continuous wave second-harmonic generation for the first time in such structures with output power exceeding 1 µW. Also, Type-II phase matching was demonstrated for the first time. Saturation was observed as the power was increased, which, as predicted, was the result of self-phase modulation when using 2 ps pulses. By using 20 ps pulses instead, saturation effects were avoided. Thermo-optically induced bistability was observed in continuous wave experiments. Difference frequency generation was demonstrated with wavelengths from the optical C-band being converted to the L- and U-bands with continuous waves. Conversion for Type-I phase matching was demonstrated over 20 nm with signal and idler wavelengths being separated by over 100 nm. Type-II phase matched conversion was also observed. Using the experimental data for analysis, self-pumped conversion devices were found to require external amplification to reach practical output powers. Threshold pump powers for optical parametric oscillators were calculated to be impractically large. Proposed improvements to the device design are predicted to allow more practical operation of integrated conversion devices based on quasi-phase matching superlattice waveguides.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Spectroscopic Studies of CdSe Nanocrystal Fine Structure and Electronic Coherences in Cryptophyte Algae</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wong, Cathy Yat-Yee</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The studies presented in this thesis explore energy transfer and relaxation in excitonic systems using two types of third-order non-linear spectroscopy, transient grating (TG) and two-dimensional photon echo (2DPE). Two major excitonic systems are studied, colloidal CdSe nanocrystals and a photosynthetic system, the light harvesting antenna protein PE545 isolated from cryptophyte algae Rhodomonas CS24. The inhomogeneous broadening present in colloidal samples has long been an obstacle to the study of the fine structure of CdSe nanocrystals. This thesis will present two studies, each using a different spectroscopy to overcome this problem and gain insight into the fine structure of the ground state exciton and biexciton. In both cases, polarization dependent measurements are used to isolate particular types of pathways through the fine structure. Polarization dependent TG measurements and a detailed kinetic model have allowed us to identify major pathways for excitonic relaxation within the fine structure of the ground state exciton, despite the inhomogeneous broadening present in the sample. Conclusions from this work include an analogy to the internal conversion and intersystem crossing transitions in molecules, concepts which are familiar to most chemists. Polarization dependent 2DPE experiments and a simulation of the resulting spectra have allowed for the direct observation of the ground state biexcitonic fine structure. The high density of states in the spectral region of the biexciton obscures these states in most spectroscopies, but the combination of polarization dependence and the use of a two-dimensional technique have revealed these elusive fine structure states. This 2DPE technique is then used to inspect light harvesting antenna protein PE545, a system of eight chromophores covalently bonded to a protein scaffold. The 2DPE measurement is capable of identifying oscillatory components of the signal which are signatures of coherent energy sharing. Using this technique, coherent energy sharing is observed throughout the spectrum of the protein at ambient temperatures, and control experiments suggest that the observed coherences are electronic, not vibrational. A short study is also presented which compares the utility of two approximations for calculations of electronic coupling and energy transfer in elongated excitonic systems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Development and Use of Polarized Light Methods to Assess Structure and Composition of Biological Tissue</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wood, Michael Frank Gunter</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The use of polarized light for characterization of biological tissues has received increased attention in recent years due to the wealth of information available in the interactions of polarized light with tissue and the noninvasive nature of optical radiation. While the depolarizing effects of multiple scattering complicate the use of polarimetry in tissue, many biological constituents affect the polarization of light such as collagen, muscle fibers, and glucose. Thus, if the effects of scattering can be accounted for⎯or utilized in the analysis⎯polarized light can potentially be used as a probe of tissue status. This thesis presents advancements in the techniques for the simulation of polarized light in tissue-simulating media, and explores two biomedical applications. Previous Monte Carlo models for simulation of polarized light propagation in tissue-simulating media do not include the effects of birefringence and optical activity, two polarizing effects of useful diagnostic potential. To overcome this limitation, our model was extended to include both these effects simultaneously, and then experimentally validated using a novel polarization phantom system. The use of polarized light for characterization of the myocardium, and specifically towards monitoring stem cell regenerative treatments of myocardial infarction, was investigated experimentally as a novel application for polarimetry. The potential for this technique is based on the changes in myocardial structure that occur with infarction and subsequent regeneration, and the associated changes in tissue birefringence. The use of polarized light for noninvasive tissue analyte monitoring, particularly glucose, was also investigated based on the optical activity exhibited by many tissue analytes due to their chiral structure. In this study, a novel combined optical polarization and intensity approach was developed and tested on Monte Carlo simulated data. The studies presented in thesis introduce new methods for polarization simulation and analysis in biological tissue and demonstrate potential for polarimetry in monitoring myocardial regeneration and noninvasive measurements of tissue analytes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Compact Antennas and Superlenses Using Transmission-line Metamaterials</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhu, Jiang</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>One goal of this thesis is to address several challenging compact antenna design issues by using transmission-line metamaterials. In particular, we demonstrate the design of a compact antenna with an extended bandwidth, multiband/multifunction compact/small antennas, and mutual-coupling reduction for two closely-spaced small antennas. The proposed compact transmission-line metamaterial antenna employs the concept of zeroth- index resonance and a wideband characteristic is enabled by detuning the resonance of each constituent metamaterial unit cell at a slightly different frequency, thus creating a multi-resonant return-loss passband. Furthermore, a single-cell transmission-line metamaterial loading scheme is applied to regular printed monopole antennas in order to introduce additional resonances at the low band and create multiband small antennas that meet the specifications for WiFi and WiMAX applications. Lastly, a simple ap- proach for reducing the mutual coupling in two closely-spaced small antennas is also presented, based on the idea of self-cancelation of the induced currents. The other important goal of this thesis is to develop volumetric negative-refractive- index transmission-line (NRI-TL) metamaterials. A volumetric NRI-TL slab is created by stacking 2D NRI transmission-line grids in the shunt-node configuration. This is done in a simple manner through images induced in a parallel-plate environment. Additional vias are strategically placed to suppress the parasitic parallel-plate mode. Moreover, multiconductor transmission-line theory is used to model the volumetric metamaterial slab. A fully-printed volumetric Veselago-Pendry transmission-line lens is designed and matched to free space. Using this proposed lens, it has been experimentally verified that the diffraction limit can be overcome.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Design and Evaluation of Dual-ended Detectors for PET Mammography</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cuddy, Sarah Grace</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Current positron emission mammography (PEM) depth of interaction (DOI) enabling detectors have low scintillator to photodetector encoding ratios, RE causing high system complexity and cost. The modularized dual-ended readout block (DERB) detector combines the Anger logic block detector with dual-ended readout to increase RE while measuring DOI. To investigate the trade-off between RE and spatial resolution, scalable DERB detectors with varying RE and light guide thickness were modelled with Monte- Carlo. Simulation showed RE can increase up to six-fold compared to the dual-ended readout design without significantly degrading spatial resolution. Experimental characterization of a RE = 9 : 8 DERB detector was found to achieve super-resolution &lt;0.5 mm for resolving crystal indices, DOI resolution of ~5 mm FWHM, and mean energy resolution of 20% without recovering photons lost to neighbouring detector modules. The model was validated by agreement of simulation results adjusted for detector quantum efficiency with experimental results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantification of Vehicle-induced Turbulence on Roadways Using Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kim, Yesul</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Turbulence is a significant factor in near-road air quality, as it affects the initial dilution, dispersion, and the ultimate fate of pollutants. This study used computational fluid dynamics simulations to model the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) on roadways, focusing on vehicle-induced turbulence. TKE was shown to decay with different power-law exponents depending on vehicle types; vehicle speeds and winds affect TKE; and thermal impacts are negligible. It was found that TKE is superimposed for vehicles in series; TKE does not dissipate far laterally, and the side-by-side interactions are not significant regardless of the directions. Thus, TKE for different traffic compositions may be expressed as a sum of the contribution from each type of vehicle. Insights gained in this study may enable the quantification of TKE for various traffic scenarios based on TKE values of single vehicle of different types, and simplify the TKE estimations in regional air quality models.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Viscous Relaxation Times of the Core and Mantle of Mars from Observations of Tidal Decay of the Orbit of Phobos</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pithawala, Taronish M.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The orbit of Phobos exhibits an along-track acceleration, which suggests energy dissipation in the Mars-Phobos system. We hypothesize that the inferred dissipation occurs within Mars. We explore the response of a layered, incompressible Maxwell viscoelastic Mars to tidal forcing by Phobos using normal mode relaxation theory. Our results elucidate the general behavior of a tidally forced viscoelastic body, and have implications for the viscoelastic structure of Mars. We find the real and imaginary part of the degree-two tidal Love number for Mars to be 0.168 and -9.32x10^−4 respectively. Models which satisfy these and other constraints have either: a fluid core with radius 2040 km and density 5410 kg/m^3; or an elastic inner core with radius 1200 km and density 6700 kg/m^3, along with a fluid outer core with thickness 850 km and density 4850 kg/m^3. These findings support previous hypotheses that Mars has at least a fluid outer core.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Shear &amp; Extensional Effects in Internal Flows of Dilute Polymer Solutions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rahman, Shamsur</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Shear and extensional flows of dilute polymer solutions were studied experimentally in an attempt to understand the mechanism of polymer-induced drag reduction. A flowcell capable of simulating the dynamics of a turbulent boundary layer, involving the motion of counter-rotating vortices, was designed and fabricated. The pressure drop across the flowcell was measured for different flow arrangements, first with a Newtonian fluid and then with drag reducing, dilute polymer solutions. The pressure drop in excess of the Newtonian baseline, after accounting for viscous effects, was used as a measure of elastic effects. With the dilute polymer solutions, elastic effects were observed both in shear, extensional, as well as presheared extensional flows. These effects can be attributed to additional normal stresses generated by shearing. For extensional flows, the observed effects were independent of elongation rates, indicating that a conclusion regarding the mechanism of drag reduction cannot be made from the flowfield investigated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon Carbide Prepared using DC Saddle Field PECVD for Photovoltaic Applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yang, Cheng-Chieh</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) can provide exceptional surface passivation essential for high-efficiency crystalline silicon solar cells. This thesis reports on the fundamental study of a-SiC:H films deposited using a novel deposition technique, DC saddle field PECVD, in contrast to the conventional industrial use of RF-PECVD. The growth conditions were optimized and correlated with passivating, structural, and optical characteristics. The lifetime has a strong dependency on deposition temperature and improves by over two orders of magnitude as the temperature increases; the maximum lifetime achieved in this work reached 0.5 ms. In addition, the Tauc optical gap can be increased from 1.7 eV to 2.3 eV by varying the precursor gas mixture ratio. Post-deposition annealing experiments demonstrate thermal stability of the samples deposited at 250 °C and in some instances shows improvement in passivation quality by a factor of two with a one-step annealing treatment at 300 °C for 15 minutes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Influence of Coriolis Forces on Flow Structures of Channelized Large-scale Turbidity Currents and their Depositional Patterns</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cossu, Remo</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Physical experiments are used to investigate the influence of the Coriolis forces on flow structures in channelized turbidity currents, and their implication for the evolution of straight and sinuous submarine channels. Initial tests were used to determine whether or not saline density currents are a good surrogate for particle-laden currents. Results imply that this assumption is valid when turbidity currents are weakly-depositional and have similar velocity and turbulence structures to saline density currents. Second, the controls of Coriolis forces on flow structures in straight channel sections are compared with two mathematical models: Ekman boundary layer dynamics and the theory of Komar [1969]. Ekman boundary layer dynamics prove to be a more suitable description of flow structures in rotating turbidity currents and should be used to derive flow parameters from submarine channels systems that are subjected to Coriolis forces. The significance of Coriolis forces for submarine channel systems were determined by evaluating the dimensionless Rossby number RoW. The Rossby number is defined as the ratio of the flow velocity, U, of a turbidity current to the channel width, W, and the rotation rate of the Earth represented by the Coriolis parameter, f. Coriolis forces are very significant for channel systems with RoW ≤ O(1). Third, the effect of Coriolis forces on the internal flow structure in sinuous submarine channels is considered. Since previous studies have only considered pressure gradient and centrifugal forces, the Coriolis force provides a crucial contribution to the lateral momentum balance in channel bends. In a curved channel, both the Rossby number RoW and the ratio of the channel curvature radius R to the channel width W, determine whether Coriolis forces affect the internal flow structure. The results demonstrate that Coriolis forces can cause a significant shift of the density interface and the downstream velocity core of channelized turbidity currents. The sediment transport regime in high-latitude channel systems, which have RoW &lt;&lt; R/W, is therefore strongly influenced by Coriolis forces. Finally, these findings are incorporated into a conceptual model describing the evolution of submarine channels at different latitudes. For instance, the Northern Hemisphere channels have a distinctly higher right levee system and migrate predominantly to the left side and generally exhibit a low sinuosity. In contrast, low latitude channel systems have RoW &gt;&gt; R/W so that centrifugal forces are more dominant. This results in more sinuous submarine channel systems with varying levee asymmetries in subsequent channel bends. In conclusion, Coriolis forces are negligible around the equator but should be considered in high latitude systems, particularly when RoW ~ O(1) and RoW &lt;&lt; R/W.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Measurement of the Top Quark Pair Production Cross Section and an in-situ B-tagging efficiency Calibration with ATLAS in pp Collisions at √s = 7 TeV in Dilepton Final States</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Guo, Bin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We present a measurement of the top anti-top quark (ttbar)production cross section in the dilepton final states from proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy at 7 TeV at the LHC. A b-tagging algorithm based on tracks displaced from the event interaction vertex is applied to identify bottom quark jets from top quark decay and reject background events. Given the relatively pure sample of bottom quark jets in ttbar dilepton final states, a new technique to measure in-situ the b-tagging efficiency is introduced that uses the distribution of the number of observed b-tagged jets. We present results with data collected at the ATLAS detector in 2010 with an integrated luminosity of 35 pb-1. The measured ttbar cross section is 176 +22/-21 (stat.) ± 20 (syst.) ± 6 (lum.) pb in the dilepton channel. We will also discuss the future prospects of this measurement.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Theory and Applications of Microstrip/Negative-refractive-index Transmission Line (MS/NRI-TL) Coupled-line Couplers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Islam, Rubaiyat</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The electromagnetic coupling of a microstrip transmission line (MS-TL) to a metamaterial backward wave Negative-Refractive-Index transmission line (NRI-TL) is the primary investigation of this dissertation. The coupling of forward waves in the MS-TL to the backward waves in the NRI-TL results in the formation of complex modes, characterized by simultaneous phase progression and attenuation along the lossless lines. Through network-theoretic considerations, we investigate the properties of these modes in the complex-frequency plane of the Laplace domain to help unravel the confusion that has existed in the literature regarding the independent excitation of a pair of conjugate complex modes. We show that it is possible to arbitrarily suppress one of the modes over a finite bandwidth and completely eliminate it at a discrete set of frequencies using proper source and load impedances. Hence we use conjugate modes with independent amplitudes in our eigenmode expansion when we analyse various coupling configurations between the two types of lines (MS/NRI-TL coupler). We derive approximate closed-form expression for the scattering parameters of the MS/NRI-TL coupler and these are complemented by design charts that allow the synthesis of a wide range of specifications. Moreover, these expressions reveal that such couplers allow for arbitrary backward coupling levels along with very high-isolation when they are made half a guided wavelength long. The MS/NRI-TL coupler offers some interesting applications which we highlight through the design and testing of a 3-dB power splitter, a high-directivity signal monitor and a compact corporate power divider. We have included design, simulation and experimental data for the fabricated prototypes exhibiting good agreement and thereby justifying the theory that has been developed in this work to explain the coupling between a right-handed MS-TL and a left-handed NRI-TL.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Modelling Detailed-chemistry Effects on Turbulent Diffusion Flames using a Parallel Solution-adaptive Scheme</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jha, Pradeep Kumar</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Capturing the effects of detailed-chemistry on turbulent combustion processes is a central challenge faced by the numerical combustion community. However, the inherent complexity and non-linear nature of both turbulence and chemistry require that combustion models rely heavily on engineering approximations to remain computationally tractable. This thesis proposes a computationally efficient algorithm for modelling detailed-chemistry effects in turbulent diffusion flames and numerically predicting the associated flame properties. The cornerstone of this combustion modelling tool is the use of parallel Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) scheme with the recently proposed Flame Prolongation of Intrinsic low-dimensional manifold (FPI) tabulated-chemistry approach for modelling complex chemistry. The effect of turbulence on the mean chemistry is incorporated using a Presumed Conditional Moment (PCM) approach based on a beta-probability density function (PDF). The two-equation k-w turbulence model is used for modelling the effects of the unresolved turbulence on the mean flow field. The finite-rate of methane-air combustion is represented here by using the GRI-Mech 3.0 scheme. This detailed mechanism is used to build the FPI tables. A state of the art numerical scheme based on a parallel block-based solution-adaptive algorithm has been developed to solve the Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes (FANS) and other governing partial-differential equations using a second-order accurate, fully-coupled finite-volume formulation on body-fitted, multi-block, quadrilateral/hexahedral mesh for two-dimensional and three-dimensional flow geometries, respectively. A standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta time-marching scheme is used for time-accurate temporal discretizations. Numerical predictions of three different diffusion flames configurations are considered in the present work: a laminar counter-flow flame; a laminar co-flow diffusion flame; and a Sydney bluff-body turbulent reacting flow. Comparisons are made between the predicted results of the present FPI scheme and Steady Laminar Flamelet Model (SLFM) approach for diffusion flames. The effects of grid resolution on the predicted overall flame solutions are also assessed. Other non-reacting flows have also been considered to further validate other aspects of the numerical scheme. The present schemes predict results which are in good agreement with published experimental results and reduces the computational cost involved in modelling turbulent diffusion flames significantly, both in terms of storage and processing time.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Photoacoustic Imaging Using Chirp Technique: Comparison with Pulsed Laser Photoacoustics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lashkari, Bahman</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The application of photoacoustic (PA) phenomena to medical imaging has been investigated for more than a decade. To implement this modality, one may choose between two types of laser sources, pulsed or continuous wave (CW). This selection affects all features of the imaging technique. Nowadays pulsed lasers are the state-of-the-art technique in the PA research. In this work, various features of the alternative frequency-domain (FD) PA were investigated. An axially symmetric transfer function model of PA wave generation and a Krimholtz-Leedom-Matthaei (KLM) transducer model were developed and used to analyze the experimental results. The controllable parameters of the FD-PA were optimized to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast, axial resolution and depth detectivity. For example, it was shown that employing the optimal chirp bandwidth can enhance the SNR by more than 10 dB. In addition to the image produced by the cross-correlation amplitude, the phase of the correlation signal was used as a separate channel. A statistical method was introduced to generate an image from this phase channel, and also to filter the PA amplitude channel. A study was also performed to compare FD PA and the prevalent pulsed method. Various features of both methods were examined experimentally using a dual-mode PA system and under the condition of maximum permissible exposure (MPE). The SNRs of both methods were evaluated theoretically and experimentally. It was shown that at low frequencies, both modalities generate comparable SNRs, and at high frequencies pulsed PA produces superior SNRs and depth detetivity. However, by increasing the laser power and decreasing the chirp duration within the safety limits, the SNR and depth detectivity of the FD-PA method are enhanced considerably. The main cause to achieve lower experimental SNRs than theoretical predictions for pulsed PA response was shown to be the oscillating baseline, which can be partially eliminated by filtering.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Full-band Structure Calculations of Optical Injection in Semiconductors: Investigations of One-color, Two-color, and Pump-probe Scenarios</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rioux, Julien</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Carrier, spin, charge current, and spin current injection by one- and two-color optical schemes are investigated within 30-band k·p theory. Parameters of the band model are optimized to give full-Brillouin zone band structures for GaAs and Ge that give accurate Γ-point effective masses and gyromagnetic factors and give access to the L valley, and to the E₁ and E₁+Δ₁ critical points in the linear optical absorption. Calculations of one- and two-photon carrier and spin injection and two-color current injection are performed for excitation energies in the range of 0—4 eV in GaAs and 0—3.5 eV in Ge. Significant spin and spin current injection occurs with 30% spin polarization in GaAs and Ge at photon energy matching the E₁ critical point. Further, the anisotropy and disparity of the current injection between parallel and perpendicular linearly-polarized beam configurations are calculated. For light propagating along a &lt;111&gt; crystal axis, anisotropic contributions in coherent current control and two-photon spin injection give rise to normal current components and in-plane spin components. In Ge, contributions from the holes to spin, electrical current, and spin current injection are investigated. Optical orientation results in 83% spin-polarized holes at the band edge. The effects of carrier dynamics in Ge are treated within a rate-equation model. The detection of spin dynamics in a pump-probe setup is considered, and the Fermi-factor approach is justified for electrons but not for holes. Carrier and current injection are further investigated in single-layer and bilayer graphene within the tight-binding model. In single-layer graphene, the linear-circular dichroism in two-photon absorption yields an absorption coefficient that is twice as large for circularly polarized light compared to linearly polarized light. Coherent current injection is largest for co-circularly polarized beams and zero for cross-circularly polarized beams. For linearly polarized beams, the magnitude of the injected current is independent of beam polarizations. In contrast, the injected current in bilayer graphene shows disparity between parallel and perpendicular configurations of the beams. The resulting angular dependence of the current is a macroscopic, measurable consequence of interlayer coupling in the bilayer.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Carrier Transport and Sensing in Compound Semiconductor Nanowires</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Salfi, Joseph R.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Experiments and analysis in this thesis advance the understanding of critical issues in the carrier transport properties of InAs and InAs/GaAs core/shell heterostructure nanowires (diameter 30-60 nm) grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Effects of robust sub-band quantization structure on the gate-voltage dependence of conductance are observed up to 77 K in a single InAs nanowire with diameter 34\pm2 nm. Electronic field effect mobility at 300 K and 30 K are typically 2000-4000 cm^2V^-1s^-1 and 10000-20000 cm^2V^-1s^-1. Strain induced by lattice mismatch in epitaxial core/shell InAs/GaAs heterostructure nanowires is found to relax by formation of dislocations, correlated with nearly one order of magnitude suppression of room temperature field effect mobility compared with bare InAs nanowires. The carrier transport properties of Mn-doped ZnO nanowires were also investigated, where despite the large bandgap, conductivity is not thermally activated, and carrier mobility is consistent with strong degeneracy of the electron gas at 10 K. A novel method was developed providing the first experimental characterization of the quasi-equilibrium gate-voltage dependent surface potential in nanowire field-effect transistors, based on statistics of charging/discharging of a single Coulomb impurity evident in a random telegraph signal, which succeeds in nanostructures with tiny (attofarad) gate capacitance, where similar capacitance-voltage methods are challenging or impossible. We find that the evolution of channel potential with gate voltage is suppressed in the transistor's accumulation regime due to the screening effects of surface states with D_ss=1-2\times10^{12} cm^-2eV^-1. The gate voltage dependence of the random telegraph signals were used as a novel probe to spectroscopically study strong carrier reflection by single Coulomb impurities in nanowires. Reflection probabilities R=0.98-0.999 approach unity for an electron gas with density n=30-10 /micron in 30 nm diameter, 1 micron long InAs nanowires at 30 K. Results were compared with microscopic theory of electron scattering by Coulomb impurities in nanowires with dielectric confinement, i.e low dielectric constant surroundings. The latter, which is known to enhance the bare Coulomb interaction and excitonic binding energy, is an essential ingredient for the strong scattering in this regime, and in small diameter nanowires causes a breakdown in linear screening. Extending this, we show that InAs nanowires can operate is extremely sensitive charge sensors with sensitivity 60 micro eHz^-1/2 at high temperatures (200 K), a combination of characteristics that is not achieved by existing technology. Strong electrostatic coupling of a single charge to the conducting electron gas in the nanowire is enabled by miniaturization of nanowire diameter, operation in a regime of carrier density where the electronic screening length exceeds the nanowire diameter, and dielectric confinement. Finally, single ZnSe nanowire photodetectors are fabricated and studied. Peak responsivity at 2.0 V bias is 20 A/W at room temperature, similar to that of the best epitaxial ZnSe photodetectors. The high responsivity is due to a photoconductive gain g=500, the ratio of carrier lifetime to carrier transit time. The former is enhanced at room temperature due to rapid selective trapping of one species of excited carriers by surface states.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Search for Wt-channel Single Top Quark Production in 7 TeV Proton-proton Collisions using the ATLAS Detector</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tardif, Dominique</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The production of single top quarks through the weak interaction is of great interest in particle physics, as it provides the only means to directly measure the CKM matrix element |Vtb|, one of the few remaining Standard Model parameters which has yet to be precisely constrained by direct experimental measurements. This thesis describes a search for Wt-channel single top quark production using proton-proton collision data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 35 pb-1. Collision events having exactly two oppositely-charged electrons or muons, a single high-transverse-momentum jet, and large missing or total transverse energy are selected, resulting in a sample with enhanced single top purity. 38 data events are found to survive the selection, in good agreement with the expected sum from all signal and background predictions of 38.6 ± 6.0. The Wt content of the selected sample is predicted to amount to 4.3 ± 0.3 events. The resulting cross-section measurement is 10 +20-10 (stat) +20-10 (syst) pb. As this level of precision is insufficient to claim evidence or discovery of this process, an upper limit is also derived for the parameter of interest, resulting in σ(pp→Wt) &lt; 70 pb at 95% confidence level.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Interface Plasmon Polariton Waveguides and Sensors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Xu, Yechen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents a novel micron-sized trapezoidal plasmonic waveguide design, called an Interface Plasmon Polariton waveguide. The guiding mechanism is explained using an effective index method and validated by simulations. The mode cut-off conditions and single-mode guiding properties are both determined using simulation and experimentally demonstrated. The waveguides have a long 1 mm propagation distance at 1550 nm wavelengths. Using this IPP waveguide, novel dielectric rib, dielectric varying-density hole-array, and metal-groove Bragg grating $\emph{in vitro}$ sensors are designed, fabricated, and characterized. The devices have a 1100 nm/RIU sensitivity and 0.006 RIU sensing resolution obtained from measurements and are validated by theory. The IPP sensors developed in this thesis not only offer competitive plasmonic sensitivity, sensing resolution, signal to noise ratio, result reproducibility, and reusability, they are also easy to fabricate and simple to package. Therefore, these new sensor designs are an enabler for lab-on-a-chip platforms to adapt plasmonic technology.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Slow Flow of Viscoelastic Fluids Through Fibrous Porous Media</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yip, Ronnie</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis reports on an experimental study of slow viscoelastic flow through models of fibrous porous media. The models were square arrays of parallel cylinders, with solid volume fractions or ‘solidities’ of 2.5%, 5.0%, and 10%. An initial study using a Newtonian fluid provided a baseline for comparison with results for two Boger fluids, so that the effects of fluid elasticity could be determined. Boger fluids are elastic fluids that have near constant viscosities and can be used in experiments without having to account for shear-thinning effects. The experimental approach involved measurements of pressure loss through the three arrays and interior velocity measurements using particle image velocimetry (PIV). For the Newtonian flows, pressure loss measurements were in good agreement with the analytical predictions of Sangani and Acrivos (1982). PIV measurements showed velocity profiles which were symmetrical and independent of flow rate. Pressure loss measurements for the Boger fluid flows revealed that the onset of elastic effects occurred at a Deborah number of approximately 0.5, for both fluids and the three arrays. Flow resistance data collapsed for the two Boger fluids, and increased with solidity. For all three models, the flow resistance increased monotonically with Deborah number, reaching values up to four times the Newtonian resistance for the 10% model. PIV measurements showed that the transverse velocity profiles for the Newtonian and Boger fluids were the same at Deborah numbers below the elastic onset. Above onset, the profiles became skewed. The skewness, like the flow resistance, was observed to increase with both Deborah number and solidity. In the wake regions between cylinders in a column, periodic flow structures formed in the spanwise direction. The structures were staggered from column to column, consistent with the skewing. As either Deborah number or solidity increased, the flow structures became increasingly three-dimensional, and the stagger became more symmetric. An analysis of fluid stresses reveals that the elastic flow resistance is attributed to additional normal stresses caused by shearing, and not by extension.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Turel, Cyrus Sam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy measurements were performed on various unconventional superconducting systems, as a function of temperature and magnetic field, to probe their superconducting order parameter symmetries. Low-temperature differential conductance measurements on the heavy-fermion system PrOs4Sb12 revealed multiple spectral features, including distinct evidence for gap nodes in the superconducting order parameter. A field-driven change in order parameter symmetry was also observed confirming the existence of multiple superconducting phases with different symmetries in PrOs4Sb12. The effect of Ru doping in Pr(Os1−xRux)4Sb12 was studied and the spectral evolution is interpreted in terms of multigap pairing. Our data which indicates that the nodal order parameter is rapidly suppressed by the introduction of Ru is consistent with other experimental results. Point-contact tips were fabricated from the high-Tc superconductor YBa2Cu3O7− (YBCO) and used to form high impedance junctions with CrO2 to determine how the formation of Andreev bound states is effected by spin polarization. Strong suppression of the d-wave Andreev reflection characteristics were observed in the YBCO/CrO2 junctions indicating that spin polarization prevents Andreev surface states from forming. The point contacts were estimated to be on the order of several nanometers in size, attesting to their microscopic nature and demonstrate the feasibility of using superconducting high-Tc tips as spin-sensitive nanoprobes of itinerant ferromagnets. Point-contact Andreev spectroscopy measurements were performed on single crystal samples of the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn5. The temperature dependence of the differential conductance spectrum, measured down to 150 mK, showed multiple features whose characteristics depended on the junction impedance. Spectral analysis revealed two co-existing order parameters with nodal symmetry indicating a highly unconventional pairing symmetry in CeCoIn5. The magnetic field dependence of the differential conductance spectrum, where the applied field was parallel to the c-axis, was measured and the upper critical field observed was consistent with that determined by other experimental studies. Low-energy peak structures were observed in low-temperature differential conductance measurements performed on the itinerant ferromagnet ZrZn2. The temperature and field dependence of the spectra were measured and discussed within the context of surface superconductivity known to exist in ZrZn2.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Control of Dopant Type and Density in Colloidal Quantum Dot Films</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Furukawa, Melissa</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are an inexpensive and solution processable photovoltaic(PV) material reaching modest efficiencies of 6%. However, doping quantum dots still remains a challenge. This thesis explores the level of doping in lead sulfide (PbS)CQDs by surface ligands and bulk doping within the quantum dot lattice using metals. In light of the knowledge that oxygen creates traps on the surface of PbS CQDs, we have turned to the use of oxygen-free fabrication. We find that under a nitrogen environment, PbS CQD films are n-type and tunable in doping by use of halide ions. We show for the first time control over the doping density of n-type CQD films over a wide range. We also show the ability to fabricate p-type PbS films with high doping density that are compatible with n-type films. This compatibility enabled us to make the world’s first CQD homojunction PV device.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Surface Plasmon Polariton Based Polarization Modulators Using Metal-polymer Waveguides</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Liao, Xinqing</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A tunable polarization modulator based on the periodic metal strips embedded in a polymer waveguide is presented. The periodic metallic structure is analyzed by Finite Element simulation (COMSOL). The calculation results show that the giant birefringence is formed by the selective cut-off of TE polarization over TM polarization, which makes it possible to design an efficient polarization modulator with a short conversion length. The metallic strips are made by using four-layer lift-off fabrication technology. The transmission and group indices of TE and TM modes are measured. However, it is observed that TE and TM modes cut off at same time, which does not agree with our predictions. The reason for failure is that the change in refractive indices is different from what we expected, which makes the device perform in opposite way. Finally, further suggestions are provided to modify the design so that the device can achieve its expected function.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Emergent Low Temperature Phases in Strongly Correlated Multi-orbital and Cold Atom Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Puetter, Christoph Minol</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis considers various strongly correlated quantum phases in solid state and cold atom spin systems. In the first part we focus on phases emerging in multi-orbital materials. We study even-parity spin-triplet superconductivity originating from Hund's coupling between t2g orbitals and investigate the effect of spin-orbit interaction on spin-triplet and spin-singlet pairing. Various aspects of the pairing state are discussed against the backdrop of the spin-triplet superconductor Sr2RuO4. Motivated by the remarkable phenomena observed in the bilayer compound Sr3Ru2O7, which point to the formation of an electronic nematic phase in the presence of critical fluctuations, we investigate how such a broken symmetry state emerges from electronic interactions. Since the broken x-y symmetry is revealed experimentally by applying a small in-plane magnetic field component, we examine nematic phases in a bilayer system and the role of the in-plane magnetic field using a phenomenological approach. In addition, we propose a microscopic mechanism for nematic phase formation specific to Sr3Ru2O7. The model is based on a realistic multi-orbital band structure and local and nearest neighbour interactions. Considering all t2g-orbital derived bands on an equal footing, we find a nematic quantum critical point and a nearby meta-nematic transition in the phase diagram. This finding harbours important implications for the phenomena observed in Sr3Ru2O7. The second part is devoted to the study of the anisotropic bilinear biquadratic spin-1 Heisenberg model, where the existence of an unusual direct phase transition between a spin-nematic phase and a dimerized valence bond solid phase in the quasi-1D limit was conjectured based on Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We establish the quasi-1D phase diagram using a large-N Schwinger boson approach and show that the phase transition is largely conventional except possibly at two particular points. We further discuss how to realize and to detect such phases in an optical lattice.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer between a Monolayer of Quantum Dots as Donors adjacent to a Monolayer of Biorecognition Elements as Acceptors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Petryayeva, Eleonora</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The unique optical properties of quantum dots (QDs) have been widely used to develop bioassays based on Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). The solid-phase assays using QDs as FRET donors have numerous practical advantages, including at least 10-fold enhancement in FRET efficiency, which is not immediately explained by theoretical predictions that model energy transfer processes of QDs in two-dimensional layers. Donor-acceptor separation distance, acceptor and donor concentrations were found to influence FRET efficiency in solid-phase assays. A novel immobilization strategy was implemented which made use of the high affinity of imidazole moieties to QD shells to build solid-phase QD bioassays. A 96-well polystyrene plate is presented as a platform suitable for rapid and convenient multiplexed detection. A typical microtiter plate reader was shown to be capable of discriminating different FRET pairs to picomol detection levels of target oligonucleotides. Furthermore, the QD-FRET bioassays provided for mismatch discrimination, and multiple cycles of regeneration were also demonstrated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental Verification of a Three Dimensional Photonic Crystal Bandgap</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jamalapur, Sri Abhishek</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Photonic crystals (PC) are periodic structures that dictate the behavior of electromagnetic radiation and can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional or three-dimensional (3D). A 3DPC was modeled and fabricated based on a three-layer design resulting in a face centered cubic structure. Different simulation methods were used to show the existence of a complete 3D bandgap, and were verified experimentally by obtaining transmission measurements in several directions. A prototype of the structure was fabricated using ECCOSTOCK HiK high dielectric sheets (dielectric of 12) and machined using a computer and numerical controlled mill. Experiments to test this structure were performed in an anechoic chamber making use of a network analyzer, a pair of horn antennas, collimating lenses, and a track for alignment. Free-space Thru-Reflect-Line measurements were taken between 10GHz and 15GHz to obtain the transmission through the prototype. Finally, a defect layer was added to the structure at different locations and localized modes observed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Characterization of the Reflection and Dispersion Properties of 'Mushroom'-related Structures and their Applications to Antennas</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Raza, Shahzad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The conventional mushroom-like Sievenpiper structure is re-visited in this thesis and a relationship is established between the dispersion and reflection phase characteristics of the structure. It is shown that the reflection phase frequency at which the structure behaves as a Perfect Magnetic Conductor (PMC) can be predicted for varying angles of incidence from the modal distribution in the dispersion diagrams and corresponds to the supported leaky modes within the light cone. A methodology to independently tune the location of the PMC frequency point with respect to the surface wave band-gap location is then presented. The influence of having said PMC frequency point located inside or outside the surface wave band-gap on a dipole radiation pattern is then studied numerically. It is demonstrated that the antenna exhibits a higher gain when the PMC frequency and band-gap coincide versus when they are separated. Two design cases are then presented for when the aforementioned properties coincide and are separated and a gain improvement of 1.2 dB is measured for the former case.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Homo and Hetero-assembly of Inorganic Nanoparticles</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Resetco, Cristina</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis describes the synthesis and assembly of metal and semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs). The two research topics include i) hetero-assembly of metal and semiconductor NPs, ii) effect of ionic strength on homo-assembly of gold nanorods (GNRs). First, we present hetero-assembly of GNRs and semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) in a chain using biotin-streptavidin interaction. We synthesized alloyed CdTeSe QDs and modified them with mercaptoundecanoic acid to render them water-soluble and to attach streptavidin. We synthesized GNRs by a seed-mediated method and selectively modified the ends with biotin. Hetero-assembly of QDs and GNRs depended on the size, ligands, and ratio of QDs and GNRs. Second, we controlled the rate of homo-assembly of GNRs by varying the ionic strength of the DMF/water solution. The solubility of polystyrene on the ends of GNRs depended on the ionic strength of the solution, which correlated with the rate of assembly of GNRs into chains.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Application of Vertical-cavity Surface-emitting Lasers for Simultaneous Laser Speckle Contrast and Intrinsic Optical Signal Imaging: Toward Chronic Portable Cortical Hemodynamic Imaging</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ringuette, Dene</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We demonstrated simultaneous intrinsic optical signal imaging (IOSI) and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) using coherence modulation of vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) diodes. The unique properties of VCSELs were exploited to deliver rapidly switched coherent and non-coherent illumination suitable for high resolution LSCI and IOSI, respectively. Utilizing three near-infrared VCSELs we were able to map changes in cortical blood oxygenation and flow during ischemia. Additionally, the subtle reflectance changes associated with cortical spreading depression were imaged using non-coherent VCSEL illumination. We are currently using two-photon laser-scanning microscopy to quantify the accuracy of LSCI and IOSI implementations. The small size and efficiency of VCSELs and modern photo diodes, makes the development of implantable dual-mode imaging devices feasible. Devices capable of chronic imaging of cortical hemodynamics could significantly enhance the range of studies available to neuroscientists and significantly aid clinicians postoperatively. The research presented in this thesis significantly furthers this objective.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Expressive Motion Editing Using Motion Extrema</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Coleman, Patrick</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>When animating characters, a key goal is the creation of a believable, expressive performance that gives a character a unique personality with a distinct style of movement. While animators are skilled at creating expressive, personalized performances, it remains challenging to change performance-related aspects of movement in existing motion data. In recent years, motion data reuse has become increasingly important as recorded motion capture data has come into widespread use. This thesis investigates the use of a sparse set of pose-centric editing controls for editing existing motion data using techniques similar to those used by keyframe animators when they create new motion. To do this, this thesis proposes the use of motion extrema--the poses a character passes through when there is a significant change in movement--as a means for choosing effective pose-centric editing controls. First, I present algorithms for identifying motion extrema. Motion extrema can be associated with individual joints or the full body of the character. I introduce a set of approaches for identifying motion extrema; these include the use of extrema of differential measures and the explicit search for times at which the body or a joint is in a spatially extreme configuration. I then present three motion editing applications that use motion extrema as a foundation for applying motion edits. The first application, pose-centric editing, allows users to interactively change poses in a motion, and the system modifies the motion to respect existing ground contact. The second application--staggered poses, introduces a model of character pose that explicitly encodes how timing varies among motion extrema on different parts of the body. This timing variation is commonly used by animators to model overlapping action. By introducing an algorithm for finding timing variation on motion extrema in existing motion, this system enables users to make high-level changes to timing patterns to change overlap effects in existing motion. Finally, I present a procedural motion editing application that targets a specific aspect of motion style; this technique is called spatial exaggeration. Spatial exaggeration changes the geometric relationships among extreme poses. Such edits cause movement to appear more or less energetic. Overall, these applications demonstrate that performance-related aspects of existing motion can be edited using a sparse set of controls in the form of motion extrema.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Modern Foundations of Light Transport Simulation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lessig, Christian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Light transport simulation aims at the numerical computation of the propagation of visible electromagnetic energy in macroscopic environments. In this thesis, we develop the foundations for a modern theory of light transport simulation, unveiling the geometric structure of the continuous theory and providing a formulation of computational techniques that furnishes remarkably efficacy with only local information. Utilizing recent results from various communities, we develop the physical and mathematical structure of light transport from Maxwell's equations by studying a lifted representation of electromagnetic theory on the cotangent bundle. At the short wavelength limit, this yields a Hamiltonian description on six-dimensional phase space, with the classical formulation over the space of "positions and directions" resulting from a reduction to the five-dimensional cosphere bundle. We establish the connection between light transport and geometrical optics by a non-canonical Legendre transform, and we derive classical concepts from radiometry, such as radiance and irradiance, by considering measurements of the light energy density. We also show that in idealized environments light transport is a Lie-Poisson system for the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms, unveiling a tantalizing similarity between light transport and fluid dynamics. Using Stone's theorem, we also derive a functional analytic description of light transport. This bridges the gap to existing formulations in the literature and naturally leads to computational questions. We then address one of the central challenges for light transport simulation in everyday environments with scattering surfaces: how are efficient computations possible when the light energy density can only be evaluated pointwise? Using biorthogonal and possibly overcomplete bases formed by reproducing kernel functions, we develop a comprehensive theory for computational techniques that are restricted to pointwise information, subsuming for example sampling theorems, interpolation formulas, quadrature rules, density estimation schemes, and Monte Carlo integration. The use of overcomplete representations makes us thereby robust to imperfect information, as is often unavoidable in practical applications, and numerical optimization of the sampling locations leads to close to optimal techniques, providing performance which considerably improves over the state of the art in the literature.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Development of Frequency and Phase Modulated Thermal-wave Methodologies for Materials Non-destructive Evaluation and Thermophotonic Imaging of Turbid Media</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tabatabaei, Nima</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In frequency-domain photothermal radiometry (FD-PTR) a low-power intensity-modulated optical excitation generates thermal-wave field inside the sample and the subsequent infrared radiation from the sample is analyzed to detect material’s inhomogeneities. The non-contact nature of FD-PTR makes it very suitable for non-destructive evaluation of broad range of materials. Moreover, the methodology is based on intrinsic contrast of light absorption which can be used as a diagnostic tool for inspection of malignancy in biological tissues. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that the physics of heat diffusion allows for a highly damped and dispersive propagation of thermal-waves. As a result, the current FD-PTR modalities suffer from limited inspection depth and poor axial/depth resolution. The main objective of this thesis is to show that using alternative types of modulation schemes (such as linear frequency modulation and binary phase coding) and radar matched filter signal processing, one can obtain localized responses from inherently diffuse thermal wave fields. In this thesis, the photothermal responses of turbid, transparent, and opaque media to linear frequency modulated and binary phase coded excitations are analytically derived. Theoretical simulations suggest that matched-filtering in diffusion-wave field acts as constructive interferometry, localizing the energy of the long-duty excitation under a narrow peak and allowing one to construct depth resolved images. The developed technique is the diffusion equivalent of optical coherence tomography and is named thermal coherence tomography. It was found that the narrow-band binary phase coded matched filtering yields optimal depth resolution, while the broad-band linear frequency modulation can be used to quantify material properties through the multi-parameter fitting of the experimental data to the developed theory. Thermophotonic detection of early dental caries is discussed in detail as a potential diagnostic application of the proposed methodologies. The performance of the diagnostic system is verified through a controlled demineralization protocol as well as in teeth with natural caries.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Determining the Effective Parameters of Metamaterials</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Woodley, Jonathan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this dissertation the proper determination and allowable signs of the effective parameters of metamaterial structures will be examined. First, a method that was commonly used to determine the presence of a negative index of refraction will be discussed. It will be shown that this method, which relies on the appearance of transmission peaks in the region where the real parts of the effective permittivity and permeability are expected to be negative, does not provide sufficient evidence that a negative index exists. Two alternate methods will then be presented that can be used to properly determine the sign of the index. Then, the form of the index in media that exhibit backward wave propagation will be examined from a purely three dimensional wave propagation point of view. It will be shown that in an isotropic medium backward wave propagation requires that the index be negative and in an anisotropic medium it requires that the index be negative along at least one of the three principal axes. In short, the necessary and sufficient condition for the negative index of refraction is the existence of the backward wave. Next, a technique commonly used to retrieve the effective parameters in metamaterials from transmission and reflection data will be considered. It will be shown that this retrieval technique can lead to unphysical claims that the imaginary parts of the effective permittivity or permeability can be negative even though the medium remains passive. By comparing the effective parameters obtained analytically and from the retrieval technique it will be shown that these unphysical claims are the result of error in the numerical simulations. The concepts of causality and analyticity will also be discussed by considering the Lorentzian model and it will be shown that this model does not allow the imaginary parts of the permittivity or permeability to be negative in the metamaterials consisting of split ring resonators and split wires.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Competing Orders in Strongly Correlated Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ramachandran, Ganesh</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Systems with competing orders are of great interest in condensed matter physics. When two phases have comparable energies, novel interplay effects such can be induced by tuning an appropriate parameter. In this thesis, we study two problems of competing orders - (i) ultracold atom gases with competing superfluidity and Charge Density Wave(CDW) orders, and (ii) low dimensional antiferromagnets with Neel order competing against various disordered ground states. In the first part of the thesis, we study the attractive Hubbard model which could soon be realized in ultracold atom experiments. Close to half-filling, the superfluid ground state competes with a low-lying CDW phase. We study the collective excitations of the superfluid using the Generalized Random Phase Approximation (GRPA) and strong-coupling spin wave analysis. The competing CDW phase manifests as a roton-like excitation. We characterize the collective mode spectrum, setting benchmarks for experiments. We drive competition between orders by imposing superfluid flow. Superflow leads to various instabilities: in particular, we find a dynamical instability associated with CDW order. We also find a novel dynamical incommensurate instability analogous to exciton condensation in semiconductors. In the second part, inspired by experiments on Bi3Mn4O12(NO3)(BMNO), we first study the interlayer dimer state in spin-S bilayer antiferromagnets. At a critical bilayer coupling strength, condensation of triplet excitations leads to Neel order. In describing this transition, bond operator mean field theory suffers from systematic deviations. We bridge these deviations by taking into account corrections arising from higher spin excitations. The interlayer dimer state shows a field induced Neel transition, as seen in BMNO. Our results are relevant to the quantitative modelling of spin-S dimerized systems. We then study the J1−J2 model on the honeycomb lattice with frustrating next-nearest neighbour exchange. For J2&gt;J1/6, quantum and thermal fluctuations lead to ‘lattice nematic’ states. For S=1/2, this lattice nematic takes the form of a valence bond solid. With J2&lt;J1 /6, quantum fluctuations melt Neel order so as to give rise to a field induced Neel transition. This scenario can explain the observed properties of BMNO. We discuss implications for the honeycomb lattice Hubbard model.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantitative Evaluation of Semiconductor Nanocrystals as Contrast Agents for Fluorescence Molecular Imaging</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Roy, Mathieu</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Fluorescence molecular imaging has been triggering interest in the scientific community for the last decade due to its great potential for improved early cancer detection and image-guided treatment. Semiconductor nanoparticles, also known as quantum dots, have been identified as potential contrast agents for molecular imaging, but there is a lack of quantitative contrast optimization studies that would enable precise and robust dosimetry calculations. These calculations are crucial to determine the feasibility, risk and cost of any contrast-enhanced clinical imaging procedure. This thesis presents a first attempt at developing a quantitative dosimetry framework for quantum dot-based contrast-enhanced fluorescence molecular imaging, by combining novel experimental methods and validated mathematical models. Three studies were completed to develop the dosimetry framework. In the first study, we design a novel homogenized optical tissue phantom approach to investigate with precision the effects of various photophysical parameters, such as the excitation and emission wavelengths, tissue absorption and scattering coefficient spectra, tissue autofluorescence spectra, target fluorescence spectra and target depth, on the detected contrast. In the second study, we use the approach to investigate the influence of tissue optical absorption and scattering on contrast behavior for various ex vivo tissue samples, and develop performance metrics to quantify the optimization results. In the third study, we perform vascular fluorescence contrast-enhanced imaging in the dorsal skinfold window chamber mouse model to investigate the effects of pharmacokinetics, blood absorption, vessel diameter and injected dose on the detected contrast. We also describe the relationship between the injected volume and vascular contrast, and transfer the performance metrics developed previously to estimate the minimum injection dose under various conditions. These studies are expected to serve as a stepping stone to further develop contrast optimization and dosimetry models for the emerging field of fluorescence molecular imaging.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Study on Vibration-induced Particle Motion under Microgravity</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Saadatmand, Sayed Mehrrad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Production of protein and semi-conductor crystals with advanced quality and properties is considered to be possible under microgravity conditions due to the absence of natural convection effects. Such materials have several beneficial properties that can improve the human life. An example is the synthesis of protein crystals with improved structure that can be determined for the production of advanced drugs. In the past experiments conducted aboard several space platforms, however, g-jitter induced convective flow may have resulted in certain effects that reduced the quality of the produced crystals. To investigate the effects of g-jitter on the motion of small particles, experiments were conducted under normal gravity by suspending spherical stainless steel particles of different sizes with a thin wire or synthetic silk thread in a rectangular fluid cell. The fluid viscosities were 350 and 1,000 times higher than water. To produce the g-jitter induced motion in the fluid, the cell was subjected to horizontal sinusoidal vibrations with different frequencies and amplitudes. The focus of the experiments so far has been on vibration-induced force on the particle vibrating parallel to a near wall. Relatively low viscosity fluids such as water have been previously determined to produce a force on the particle which attracts the particle to the nearest fluid cell wall. The present experiments with a more viscous fluid have revealed an interesting change in the force from attraction in low viscosity fluids to repulsion in high viscosity liquids. Moreover, the repulsion force has been observed to increase with an increase in the fluid viscosity and the fluid cell amplitude. A numerical code, Partflow3d, has also been used to predict the vibration effects on the particle. Although, based on the objectives of this study, the numerical simulations were conducted only for a wire-free particle under microgravity, their results were qualitatively in agreement with the experimental results. The numerical simulations also revealed that the physical mechanism of the hydrodynamic attraction-repulsion force on the particle is related to Bernoulli’s principle of reduced pressure in high velocity zones in the fluid surrounding the particle. The results so far have shown new aspects of the g-jitter induced motion of the particle near a fluid cell wall. Better understanding of the forces affecting the particles in a fluid cell subjected to small vibrations, can reveal novel ways to produce new advanced materials and also improve material processing both in microgravity and normal gravity conditions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Eurasian Snow Cover and the Role of Linear Interference in Stratosphere-troposphere Interactions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Smith, Karen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The classical problem of predicting the atmospheric circulation response to extratropical surface forcing is revisited in the context of the observed connection between autumn snow cover anomalies over Eurasia and the wintertime Northern Annular Mode (NAM). In general circulation model (GCM) simulations with prescribed autumn Siberian snow forcing, a vertically propagating Rossby wave train is generated, driving dynamical stratospheric warming and a negative NAM response that couples to the troposphere. It is shown that unexplained aspects of the evolution of this response can be clarified by examining the time evolution of the phasing, and hence the linear interference, between the wave response and the background climatological wave. When the wave response and background wave are in phase (out of phase), wave activity into the stratosphere is amplified (attenuated) and the zonal mean stratosphere-troposphere NAM response displays a negative (positive) tendency. This effect is probed further in a simplified GCM with imposed lower tropospheric cooling. As in the comprehensive GCM, linear interference strongly influences the NAM response. The transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour is shown to depend on forcing strength. Linear interference also plays a key role in the observed October Eurasian snow cover-NAM connection. It is shown that the time lag between October Eurasian snow anomalies and the peak wave activity flux arises because the Rossby wave train associated with the snow is out of phase with the climatological stationary wave from October to mid-November. Beginning in mid-November, the associated wave anomaly migrates into phase with the climatological wave, leading to constructive interference and anomalously positive upward wave activity fluxes. Current generation climate models do not capture this behaviour. Linear interference is not only associated with stratospheric warming due to Eurasian snow cover anomalies but is a general feature of both Northern and Southern Hemisphere stratosphere-troposphere interactions, and in particular dominated the negative NAM events of the fall-winter of 2009-2010. The interannual variability in upward wave activity flux during the season of strongest stratosphere-troposphere interactions is primarily determined by linear interference of quasi-stationary waves. The persistence of the linear interference component of this flux may help improve wintertime extratropical predictability.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Broadband Microwave Negative Group Delay Transmission Line Phase Shifters</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Keser, Sinan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The analysis and design of passive broadband negative group delay (NGD) transmission line phase shifters is presented. By extending the metamaterial transmission line concept to include loss, a NGD unit cell is proposed. Phase shifters are supplemented with NGD unit cells to produce a flattened phase response significantly increasing phase bandwidths. The design methodology of a NGD phase shifter is presented with consideration of nominal phase, frequency, impedance, maximum insertion loss and bandwidth. The relation between gain, bandwidth and group delay signifies a fundamental design limitation and tradeoff. A significant application of NGD phase shifters for removing beam squint in series fed antenna arrays is discussed. Several NGD phase shifters are fabricated and experimentally verified in the UHF band upwards of 1 GHz using planar microstrip transmission lines loaded with passive surface mount RF components with both positive and negative phase shifts.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Influence of End Conditions on Vortex Shedding from a Circular Cylinder in Sub-critical Flow</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Khoury, Eric</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The effect of end boundary conditions on the three-dimensionality of the vortex shedding from a circular cylinder in sub-critical flow has been studied experimentally, with a focus on the unsteady nature of the vortex filaments. Analysis of the near-wake of the cylinder was undertaken to determine the dependency of the spanwise uniformity of the vortex shedding on the end conditions. Flow visualization was performed downstream of the cylinder, and the temporal variation of the vortex filament angle was observed. Vortex dislocations were found to occur in this Reynolds Number regime regardless of the end boundary conditions. Having a cylinder bounded by two elliptical leading edge geometry endplates at an L/D value of five yielded parallel shedding with a reduction in the time-based variation of the vortex filament angle, and was shown to be the ideal end conditions for modeling an infinite cylinder in a free-surface water channel.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Optical, Electrical and Thermal Modelling of Nanoscale Plasmonic Devices</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kruger, Brett Allan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The behaviour of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in nanoscale geometries is studied using numerical methods supported by theory and experiment. First, we derive the behaviour of SPPs at graded metal-dielectric interfaces, including dispersion relations, field profiles, propagation velocities, losses, and cutoff wavelength. Numerical simulations show excellent agreement with analytic solutions. In the second part of the thesis we design hybrid vanadium dioxide-plasmonic based absorption switches. The switches are designed and optimized using optical, electrical and thermal simulations. 5 $\mu$m switch designs have extinction ratios exceeding 30 dB and require powers of 10 mW. A switch is fabricated based on the proposed design. A 7 $\mu$m experimental switch reaches 16.4 dB of extinction and requires 64 mW of power, making it one of the most efficient optical switches ever demonstrated in terms of extinction and power consumption. Numerical simulations predict experimental results with a high degree of accuracy.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Combustion Properties of Biologically Sourced Alternative Fuels</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Barnwal, Abhishek</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The effects of pressure on various properties of ten different syngas fueled flames were analyzed using one and two dimensional simulations. One-dimensional premixed flames were modeled in CANTERA. Flame speed, adiabatic flame temperature and thermal diffusivity as functions of equivalence ratio and pressure were quantified for the fuels using four chemical kinetic mechanisms. Data from the different mechanisms displayed good agreement with data from previous experimental benchmarks. Two-dimensional axisymmetric co-flow flames were simulated in a state of the art computational framework for modeling laminar flames. Flame structure comparisons were made with past experimental and numerical results as well as with theoretical predictions. Good agreement in stoichiometric flame height was observed with past theoretical and numerical flame height measurements. Visible flame heights had little correlation with the stoichiometric flame heights. The flame radius was also noted to be proportional to p^-0.35 at high pressures instead of p^-0.5 as predicted by theory.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Computational Fluid Dynamics Analysis for Wastewater Floc Breakage in Orifice Flow</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Fernandes, Aaron Xavier</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the present work, the breakage of wastewater particles in orifice flow is investigated through numerical simulations. Using maximum strain rate along particle paths as the breakage criterion, breakage is predicted using computational fluid dynamics. The numerical simulations confirm that nominal orifice strain rate cannot explain the higher particle breakage in single-orifice systems compared to that of multi-orifice systems, instead particle breakage was found to correlate well with the maximum strain rates in the system. On the issue of effect of initial particle location on breakage, numerical modeling shows that particles travelling along the centerline are suspected to break less than those travelling near the wall. However, experiments designed to study the breakage of particles injected at various radial locations proved inconclusive. Finally, results suggest that while single orifice systems are ideal for strong particles, multi-orifice systems may be more effective in breaking weak particles.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical Modelling of Staged Combustion Aft-injected Hybrid Rocket Motors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Nijsse, Jeff</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The staged combustion aft-injected hybrid (SCAIH) rocket motor is a promising design for the future of hybrid rocket propulsion. Advances in computational fluid dynamics and scientific computing have made computational modelling an effective tool in design and development. The focus of this thesis is the numerical modelling of the SCAIH rocket motor in a turbulent combustion, high-speed, reactive flow accounting for solid soot transport and radiative heat transfer. The SCAIH motor has a shear coaxial injector with liquid oxygen injected centrally at sub-critical conditions: 150K, 150m/s (Mach≈0.9), and a gas-generator gas-solid mixture of one-third carbon soot by mass injected in the annual opening at 1175K, and 460m/s (Mach≈0.6). Flow conditions in the near injector region and the flame anchoring mechanism are of particular interest. Overall, the flow is shown to exhibit instabilities and the flame is shown to anchor directly on the injector faceplate with temperatures in excess of 2700K.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Evanescent Photosynthesis: A New Approach to Sustainable Biofuel Production</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ooms, Matthew</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Immobilization of photosynthetic cultures has been used to generate biofuels and high value compounds through direct conversion of CO2 and water using sunlight. Compared with suspended cultures, immobilized bacteria can achieve much higher densities resulting in greater areal productivity. Limitations exist however, on the density that can be reached without compromising access to light and other nutrients. In this thesis an optofluidic approach to overcoming the challenge of light delivery to high density cultures of cyanobacteria is described and proof of concept experiments presented. This approach uses optical waveguides to deliver light to cells through bacterial interaction with the evanescent field and is tailored to meet each cell's need for light and nutrients. Experiments presented here demonstrate biofilm proliferation in the presence of evanescent fields. Illumination of surfaces by surface plasmon enhanced evanescent fields is also shown to be an effective and potentially useful technique to grow biofilms within optofluidic architectures.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Generation of Transient Quantum Coherence Using Partially Coherent Radiation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sadeq, Zaheen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We investigate quantum coherences between excited states induced on quantum systems upon excitation by partially coherent radiation sources. Attempts at rejuvenating coherences using noisy sources are also explored. This work is most relevant to studies of photo-excitation of light harvesting systems under natural conditions as well as to quantum optical experiments using partially coherent lasers. The transient coherent response of a model $V$ system upon irradiation by various models of incoherent light is explored and it was found that it was possible to induce transient excited state coherences upon excitation. These excited state coherences eventually become a small fraction of population and the system reaches a mixed state. Lastly, we critique an existing literature model of excitation by noisy laser and we show that the coherence observed in that scenario is artificial. We propose an alternative using a physical model of noisy excitation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Magnetic Attitude Control For Spacecraft with Flexible Appendages</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Stellini, Julian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The design of an attitude control system for a flexible spacecraft using magnetic actuation is considered. The nonlinear, linear, and modal equations of motion are developed for a general flexible body. Magnetic control is shown to be instantaneously underactuated, and is only controllable in the time-varying sense. A PD-like control scheme is proposed to address the attitude control problem for the linear system. Control gain limitations are shown to exist for the purely magnetic control. A hybrid control scheme is also proposed that relaxes these restrictions by adding a minimum control effort from an alternate three-axis actuation system. Floquet and passivity theory are used to obtain gain selection criteria that ensure a stable closed-loop system, which would aid in the design of a hybrid controller for a flexible spacecraft. The ability of the linearized system to predict the stability of the corresponding nonlinear system is also investigated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Development and Error Analysis of a Conrad Probe for Measurements of 2D Velocity in a Laminar Boundary Layer</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yuan, Zhou</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The present study proposes to use a Conrad probe for transient growth study by measuring the two-dimensional velocity behind an array of roughness elements in the Blasius boundary layer. A look-up table approach is proposed to increase the accuracy of the data reduction process at low velocities, based on the results of the calibration performed in a round jet. A velocity correction method is proposed to minimize the errors due to high velocity shear and wall-proximity in the Blasius boundary layer by comparing Conrad probe results to previous hot-wire data. Measurements of the steamwise velocity perturbation obtained with the Conrad probe agree with previous studies. The measured spanwise perturbation confirms the transport process suggested by simulation. The results show that the perturbation amplitude increases by increasing both the freestream velocity and roughness elements height. However, the mechanism for changing the perturbation amplitude of influence differs for these two parameters.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Growth and Characterization of ZnSe and ZnTe Alloy Nanowires</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Li, Zhong</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The objective of this thesis is to explore the synthesis and characterization of high quality binary ZnTe nanowires with great potential for development of optoelectronic devices including high efficiency photovoltaic cells for energy conversion and high sensitivity photodetectors for green fluorescent protein bioimaging at single molecule level. To systematically explore the fabrication process for high quality nanowires, a chemical vapour deposition system was built for nanowire growth. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were used to optimize the reactor and growth parameters. The simulations were validated by experimental measurements. Room temperature photoluminescence measurements showed that high crystal quality with very low defects by single step growth was achieved. This single step growth technique makes a great improvement compared to the reported growth followed by annealing, which achieved equivalent crystal quality. This simplification could be of use in large scale synthesis of nanowires. The simulation results also showed that reactant species concentration is a key factor influencing the growth. A metal-organic chemical vapour deposition system was thus built to independently control reactant concentrations for ZnTe nanowire growth. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements of as-grown ZnTe nanowires showed a strong near band-edge emission. In addition, a deep level oxygen-related band was observed for the first time. From the detailed analysis of thermal quenching of the photoluminescence, it was shown that the deep level emission was partially from the intermediate band of the material. This is of great importance due to the theoretical absorption efficiency that is as high as 63% for intermediate band materials, which is more than two times of that of current single junction concentrators, and few materials possessing this property. Individual ZnTe nanowires, grown after optimization, were patterned and contacted, and their conductivity and photoconductivity were measured at room temperature. A single ZnTe nanowire serving as a photodetector was shown to have the highest reported visible responsivity of 360 A/W (at 530 nm), and a gain of 8,640 (at 3 V bias). The responsivity is roughly 18 times higher than that of silicon avalanche photodiodes. This demonstrates that ZnTe nanowires are strong candidates for single photon detection.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Reaction Dynamics of Alkyl Bromides at Silicon; Experiment and Theory</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Huang, Kai</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Physisorption and reaction at silicon surfaces of a series of brominated organic molecules: bromoethane, 1,2-dibromoethane, 1-bromopropane, 1-bromobutane and 1-bromopentane were examined by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). On Si(111)-7×7, a widely-spaced “one-per-corner-hole” pattern was observed, formed by the physisorption and reaction of several alkyl bromides. This “one-per-corner-hole” pattern suggested long-range repulsion between the adsorbates. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, performed by others in parallel with these experiments, showed that this long-range repulsion was due to lateral charge transfer in the Si(111)-7×7 surface consequent on the physisorption of an alkyl bromide or chemisorption of a Br atom. The reaction rate of bromine ‘abstraction’ (transfer of a Br-atom from the adsorbate to the silicon) was examined for two physisorbed states of 1 bromopentane on Si(111)-7×7, one vertical and one horizontal, each distinguishable by STM. The energy barrier was found to be significantly lower for abstraction of Br-atom from the vertical than for the horizontal 1 bromopentane, both for thermal and electron-induced reaction. This finding accords with previous DFT calculations for methyl bromide, for which theory exhibited a clear preference for a vertical transition state in the bromination of Si(111)-7×7. The effect of alkyl chain-length on the rate of thermally-induced dissociative attachment reactions was investigated for a series of primary bromo-alkanes (bromoethane, 1-bromopropane and 1-bromobutane) on a different face of silicon; Si(100)-c(4×2). These three bromo-alkanes all physisorbed exclusively ‘inter-row’, bridging the gap between Si dimer-rows of Si(100)-c(4×2). Thermal reaction was highly ‘localized’, i.e. the chemisorbed Br-atom was formed directly below the parent bromo-alkane. The thermal barrier heights were found experimentally to increase systematically with chain length. This trend was interpreted, on the basis of DFT calculations performed by the author, as being due to the extra energy required to lift the alkyl group in going from the initial physisorbed state to the more-nearly vertical transition state.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hybrid Plasmon Waveguides: Theory and Applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Alam, Muhammad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The study and applications of surface plasmon polaritons (SP) – also known as plasmonics – has attracted the interest of a wide range of researchers in various fields such as biology, physics, and engineering. Unfortunately, the large propagation losses of the SP severely limit the usefulness of plasmonics for many practical applications. In this dissertation a new wave guiding mechanism is proposed in order to address the large propagation losses of the plasmonic guides. Possible applications of this guiding scheme are also investigated. The proposed hybrid plasmonic waveguide (HPWG) consists of a metal layer separated from a high index slab by a low index spacer. A detailed analysis is carried out to clarify the wave guiding mechanism and it is established that the mode guided by the HPWG results from the coupling of a SP mode and a dielectric waveguide mode. A two dimensional HPWG is proposed and the effects of various parameters on the HPWG performance are analyzed in detail. This structure offers the possibility of integrating plasmonic devices on a silicon platform. The proposed waveguide supports two different modes: a hybrid TM mode and a conventional TE mode. The hybrid TM mode is concentrated in the low index layer, whereas the conventional TE mode is concentrated in the high index region. This polarization diversity is used to design a TM- and a TE-pass polarizer and a polarization independent coupler on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. Moreover, the performance of a HPWG bend is investigated and is compared with plasmonic waveguide bends. The proposed devices are very compact and outperform previously reported designs. The application of HPWG for biosensing is also explored. By utilizing the polarization diversity, the HPWG biosensor can overcome some of the limitations of plasmonic sensors. For example, unlike plasmonic sensors, the HPWG biosensor can remove the interfering bulk and surface effects.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Search for Universal Extra Dimensions in the Two Photon and Missing Transverse Energy Final State with the ATLAS Detector</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Fatholahzadeh, Baharak</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A search for diphoton events with large missing transverse energy is conducted using 3.1 pb^{-1} of integrated luminosity of proton-proton collisions at center of mass energy \sqrt{s}=7 TeV. The data were collected with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider during the period from March 30, 2010 until August 30, 2010. No excess of such events is observed above the Standard Model background prediction. This result is interpreted in the context of a gravity mediated One Universal Extra Dimension model with \Lambda R=20, N=6 and M_{D}=5 TeV, where \Lambda is the cutoff scale, N is the number of large extra dimensions and M_{D} is the Planck scale in the higher dimensional theory. The compactification radius of the Universal Extra Dimension, R, is excluded for values of 1/R &lt; 728 GeV at 95\% CL, providing the most stringent limit on this model at the time of publication.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Strong-Coupling Quantum Dynamics in a Structured Photonic Band Gap: Enabling On-chip All-optical Computing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ma, Xun Jr.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, we demonstrate a new type of resonant, nonlinear, light-matter interaction facilitated by the unique electromagnetic vacuum density-of-state (DOS) structure of Photonic Band Gap (PBG) materials. Strong light localization inside PBG waveguides allows extremely strong coupling between laser fields and embedded two-level quantum dots (QD). The resulting Mollow splitting is large enough to traverse the precipitous DOS jump created by a waveguide mode cutoff. This allows the QD Bloch vector to sense the non-smoothness of the vacuum structure and evolve in novel ways that are forbidden in free space. These unusual strong-coupling effects are described using a "vacuum structure term" of the Bloch equation, combined with field-dependent relaxation rates experienced by the QD Bloch vector. This leads to alternation between coherent evolution and enhanced relaxation. As a result, dynamic high-contrast switching of QD populations can be realized with a single beam of picosecond pulses. During enhanced relaxation to a slightly inverted steady state at the pulse peak, the Bloch vector rapidly switches from anti-parallel to parallel alignment with the pulse torque vector. This then leads to a highly inverted state through subsequent coherent "adiabatic following" near the pulse tail, providing a robust mechanism for picosecond, femto-Joule all-optical switching. The simultaneous input of a second, weaker (signal) driving beam at a different frequency on top of the stronger (holding) beam enables rich modulation effects and unprecedented coherent control over the QD population. This occurs through resonant coupling of the signal pulse with the Mollow sideband transitions created by the holding pulse, leading to either augmentation or negation of the final QD population achieved by the holding pulse alone. This effect is applied to ultrafast all-optical logic AND, OR and NOT gates in the presence of significant (0.1 THz) nonradiative dephasing and (about 1%) inhomogeneous broadening. Further numerical studies of pulse evolutions inside the proposed devices demonstrate satisfactory population contrast within a PBG waveguide length of about 10 micro meter. These results provide the building blocks for low-power, ultrafast, multi-wavelength channel, on-chip, all-optical computing.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nanoscale Chemical Imaging of Synthetic and Biological Materials using Apertureless Near-field Scanning Infrared Microscopy</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Paulite, Melissa Joanne</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Apertureless near-field scanning infrared microscopy is a technique in which an impinging infrared beam is scattered by a sharp atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip oscillating at the resonant frequency of the cantilever in close proximity to a sample. Several advantages offered by near-field imaging include nanoscale imaging with high spatial resolution (near-field imaging is not restricted by the diffraction limit of light) and the ability to differentiate between chemical properties of distinct compounds present in the sample under study due to differences in the scattered field. An overview of the assembly, tuning, and implementation of the near-field instrumentation is provided, as well as detailed descriptions about the samples probed and other instrumentation used. A description of the near-field phenomena, a comparison between aperture and apertureless-type near-field microscopy, and the coupled dipoles model explaining the origin of the chemical contrast present in near-field infrared imaging was discussed. Simultaneous topographic and chemical contrast images were collected at different wavelengths for the block copolymer thin film, polystyrene-b-poly(methyl ethacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) and for amyloid fibrils synthesized from the #21-31 peptide of β2-microglobulin. In both cases it was observed that the experimental scattered field spectrum correlates strongly with that calculated using the far-field absorption spectrum, and using near-field microscopy, nanoscale structural and/or compositional variations were observed, which would not have been possible using ensemble FTIR measurements. Lastly, tip-enhanced Raman spectra of the #21-31 and #16-22 peptide fragments from the β2-microglobulin and Aβ(1-40) peptide were collected, examined, and an outline of the optimization conditions described.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Basis Functions With Divergence Constraints for the Finite Element Method</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pinciuc, Christopher</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Maxwell's equations are a system of partial differential equations of vector fields. Imposing the constitutive relations for material properties yields equations for the curl and divergence of the electric and magnetic fields. The curl and divergence equations must be solved simultaneously, which is not the same as solving three separate scalar problems in each component of the vector field. This thesis describes a new method for solving partial differential equations of vector fields using the finite element method. New basis functions are used to solve the curl equation while allowing the divergence to be set as a constraint. The basis functions are defined on a mesh of bricks and the method is applicable for geometries that conform to a Cartesian coordinate system. The basis functions are a combination of cubic Hermite splines and second order Lagrange interpolation polynomials. The method yields a linearly independent set of constraints for the divergence, which is modelled to second order accuracy within each brick. Mesh refinement is accomplished by dividing selected bricks into $2\times 2\times 2$ smaller bricks of equal size. The change in the node pattern at an interface where mesh refinement occurs necessitates a modified implementation of the divergence constraints as well as additional constraints for hanging nodes. The mesh can be refined to an arbitrary number of levels. The basis functions can exactly model the discontinuity in the normal component of the field at a planar interface. The method is modified to solve problems with singularities at material boundaries that form $90^{\circ}$ edges and corners. The primary test problem of the new basis functions is to obtain the resonant frequencies and fields of three-dimensional cavities. The new basis functions can resolve physical solutions and non-physical, spurious modes. The eigenvalues obtained with the new method are in good agreement with exact solutions and experimental values in cases where they exist. There is also good agreement with results from second-order edge elements that are obtained with the software package HFSS. Finally, the method is modified to solve problems in cylindrical coordinates provided the domain does not contain the coordinate axis.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Measurement of High-Q2 Neutral Current Cross-sections with Longitudinally Polarised Positrons with the ZEUS Detector</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Stewart, Trevor</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The cross sections for neutral current (NC) deep inelastic scattering (DIS) in e+p collisions with a longitudinally polarised positron beam are measured at high momentum transfer squared (Q2 &gt; 185 GeV2) at the ZEUS detector at HERA. The HERA accelerator provides e+-p collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 318 GeV, which allows the weak contribution to the NC process to be studied at high Q2. The measurements are based on a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 135.5 pb-1 collected with the ZEUS detector in 2006 and 2007. The single differential NC cross sections dsigma/dQ2, dsigma/dx and dsigma/dy and the reduced cross section are measured. The structure function xF3 is determined by combining the e+p NC reduced cross sections with the previously measured e-p measurements. The interference structure function xF 3^gamma,Z is extracted at Q2 = 1500 GeV2. The cross-section asymmetry between the positive and negative polarisation of the positron beam is measured and the parity violation effects of the electroweak interaction are observed. The predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics agree well with the measurements.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Development of Methods for Retrospective Ultrasound Transmit Focusing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Warriner, Renee</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Single frame ultrasound B-mode image quality is largely governed by the ability to focus the ultrasound beam over a range in depths both in transmission and reception. By developing a comprehensive understanding of acoustic wave propagation two signal processing methods were identified for solving the transmission problem. We made use of both the impulse response using the classical point spread function (PSF) and the spatial sensitivity function (SSF) which describes the spatial distribution at a particular time. Using the angular spectrum method, an accurate analytical model was developed for the field distribution arising from a finite geometry, apodized and focused, plane piston transducer. While there is a thorough understanding of the radiated field arising from uniformly excited plane piston transducers, the focused equivalent (i.e., one that allows a continuous change in phase over the plane piston surface) is incomplete and assumes the Fresnel approximation. Our model addresses the effects of diffraction and evanescent waves without the use of the Fresnel approximation and is applicable at all near- and far-field locations in a lossless medium. The model was analyzed to identify new insights into wave propagation and compared with the Fresnel approximation and the spherically-focused, concave transducer. The piston transducer model was then extended to an attenuating and dispersive medium. After analysing existing models of power-law frequency dependent attenuation, a causal, spherical wave Green’s function was derived from the Navier-Stokes equation for a classical viscous medium. Modifications to the angular spectrum method were presented and used to analyze the radiated field of a focused, planar piston transducer. Finally, after presenting our signal processing strategy for improving imaging spatial resolution through minimization of the SSF, two signal processing methods were derived and analysed in simulation: a deconvolution technique to remove the effects of the ultrasound excitation wave and suppress additive noise from the received ultrasound signal, and a retrospective transmit focusing method that changed the response from a predefined transmit focus to an arbitrary transmit focal depth. Proof-of-concept simulations were presented using a variable number of scatterers and compared with the traditional matched filtering and envelope detection technique.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Influence of Synthesis Temperature on the Crystallographic and Luminescent Properties of NaYF4-based Upconverters and their Application to Amorphous Silicon Photovoltaics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Faulkner, Daniel Owen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>There are several factors which conspire to limit the efficiency of solar cells. One of these is the fact that a solar cell is unable to absorb photons of energy less than the band gap of the semiconductor from which it is made; in the case of some high-band gap materials such as amorphous silicon – the model system used in this study – this can mean that as much as 50% of the solar spectrum is unusable. Upconversion phosphors – materials which can, by way of two or more successive photon absorptions, convert low energy (typically near infrared) light into high energy (typically visible) light – offer a potential solution to this problem as they can be used to convert light, which would otherwise be useless to the cell, into light which can be used for power generation. In this thesis we work towards the application of NaYF4-based upconverters to enhanced efficiency amorphous silicon (a-Si) photovoltaic power generation. We begin by synthesizing these upconverters at a range of temperatures and studying the crystallographic and spectroscopic properties of the resulting materials, elucidating heretofore undocumented trends in their luminescence and crystallography, including the effect of synthesis temperature on upconversion intensity, crystallite size, and lattice parameter. We also investigate the emission quantum yield of these materials, beginning with an in depth discussion and investigation of two methods for recording absolute quantum yields. We demonstrate that the quantum yields of the materials may vary by a factor of over 100, depending on the synthesis conditions. After we have fully characterized these properties we turn our attention to the application of these materials to amorphous silicon solar cells, for which we provide a proof of concept by demonstrating the effect of upconversion luminescence on the photoconductance of an a-Si film. We conclude by developing a roadmap for future improvements in the field.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Information Transmission using the Nonlinear Fourier Transform</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Isvand Yousefi, Mansoor</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The central objective of this thesis is to suggest and develop one simple, unified method for communication over optical fiber networks, valid for all values of dispersion and nonlinearity parameters, and for a single-user channel or a multiple-user network. The method is based on the nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT), a powerful tool in soliton theory and exactly solvable models for solving integrable partial differential equations governing wave propagation in certain nonlinear media. The NFT decorrelates signal degrees of freedom in such models, in much the same way that the Fourier transform does for linear systems. In this thesis, this observation is exploited for data transmission over integrable channels such as optical fibers, where pulse propagation is governed by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. In this transmission scheme, which can be viewed as a nonlinear analogue of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing commonly used in linear channels, information is encoded in the nonlinear spectrum of the signal. Just as the (ordinary) Fourier transform converts a linear convolutional channel into a number of parallel scalar channels, the nonlinear Fourier transform converts a nonlinear dispersive channel described by a \emph{Lax convolution} into a number of parallel scalar channels. Since, in the spectral coordinates the NLS equation is multiplicative, users of a network can operate in independent nonlinear frequency bands with no deterministic inter-channel interference. Unlike most other fiber-optic transmission schemes, this technique deals with both dispersion and nonlinearity directly and unconditionally without the need for dispersion or nonlinearity compensation methods. This thesis lays the foundations of such a nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing system.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Comparison of CT and Optical Image-based Assessment of Liposome Distribution</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Huang, Huang</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The use of multimodal imaging as a tool to assess the in vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of nanoparticles is important in drug development and imaging-guided therapy. The current study reports the use of combined micro-CT and optical imaging FMT to quantitatively assess the whole body and intratumoural distribution of a nano-sized liposome-based CT/optical imaging probe carrying iohexol and Cy5.5. Micro-CT was used to guide the FMT tumour delineation and signal correction. This investigation demonstrates the critical role micro-CT can play in guiding FMT-based quantification of distribution. As well the combination of CT and optical imaging enable visualization of the liposomes at the whole body, tumor and cellular levels with high sensitivity and excellent anatomical background. Such non-invasive assessment of therapeutic distribution at the macro and micro scale is necessary for implementation of personalized medicine including image-guided patient stratification and real-time adjustment of therapeutic dose.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Functionalization of the Photonic Crystal Slab Biosensors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Aydin, Deniz</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This work describes the functionalization and testing of Si$_3$N$_4$-based photonic crystal slabs (PCS) for label-free biosensing. PCS support optical resonance modes that are sensitive to the local refractive index. Knowing that surface binding events change the local RI, analyte binding to the activated sensor can be detected. Various functionalization recipes were tried, and one was preferred for the biosensing experiments due to its higher yield and uniformity. Additionally, thickness of the topmost sensor layer was studied to assess biosensor performance quantified through sensitivity metrics. On the systems level, a reusable clamping system and customized microfluidic channels were designed, fabricated, and implemented on the PCS biosensors to enable device refurbishment. Proof-of-principle biodetection experiments were carried out using the established functionalization protocol on the in-house fabricated PCS. Conjugation of streptavidin and bovine serum albumin to the sensor surface was observed through wavelength shifts of the resonant modes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Design of a Shape Optimized Metallic Nano-heater</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Dewanjee, Arnab</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The absorption of the energy in the form of heat from electromagnetic radiation is strongly dependent on the shape of the surface. Also, the transfer of this generated thermal energy is dependent on the surface area of the object in contact with the surrounding medium. Here in this thesis, we present a structural optimization method for metal nanostructures based on the shape dependency of their electromagnetic heat dissipation and thermodynamic transfer to the surroundings. We have used a parallel genetic algorithm (GA) in conjunction with a coupled electromagnetic (FDTD) and thermodynamic modeling of the metallic nanostructures for the optimization. The optimized nano-structure demonstrates significant improvement in electromagnetic heating in the spectral window of optimization as well as expedited cooling properties. The symmetry of the structures which is inherent in the design procedure makes them independent of the polarization at normal incidence and insensitive to the azimuthal direction of incidence.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Lin, Charles Chih-Chin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The aim of this thesis is to establish a platform for implementing nanoscale plasmonic slot waveguide (PSW) devices that can interface with dielectric technology for hybrid silicon-plasmonic interconnect applications. For waveguide excitation, an orthogonal junction coupler that operates based on momentum matching is analyzed and then experimentally demonstrated to have coupling efficiency of 50 +/- 2 % between 450 nm wide silicon waveguide and 50 nm wide PSW across a 200 nm bandwidth. Next, for designing scalable optical components with multiple-input multiple-output capability and high fabrication tolerance, two dimensional PSW mesh structure that utilizes simultaneous power distribution and interference within a network of intersecting PSW junctions is introduced. Finally, a closed-form model for PSW mesh structures is derived by incorporating the characteristic impedance model into the scattering matrix formalism. The model can handle arbitrary combination of junctions and has less than 5 % discrepancy when compared to Finite-Difference Time-Domain results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Plasmonic Enhancement for Colloidal Quantum Dot Photovoltaics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Paz-Soldan, Daniel Alexander</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Colloidal quantum dots (CQD) are used in the fabrication of efficient, low-cost solar cells synthesized in and deposited from solution. Breakthroughs in CQD materials have led to a record efficiency of 7.0%. Looking forward, any path toward increasing efficiency must address the trade-off between short charge extraction lengths and long absorption lengths in the near-infrared spectral region. Here we exploit the localized surface plasmon resonance of metal nanoparticles to enhance absorption in CQD films. Finite-difference time-domain analysis directs our choice of plasmonic nanoparticles with minimal parasitic absorption and broadband response in the infrared. We find that gold nanoshells (NS) enhance absorption by up to 100% at λ = 820 nm by coupling of the plasmonic near-field to the surrounding CQD film. We engineer this enhancement for PbS CQD solar cells and observe a 13% improvement in short-circuit current and 11% enhancement in power conversion efficiency.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Parallel, Block-based, Adaptive Mesh Refinement, Finite-volume Scheme for Solution of Three-dimensional Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes Equations</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Prasad, Shawn Shamendra</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A parallel, block-based, adaptive mesh refinement, finite-volume scheme is developed and validated for the solution of the Favre-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations governing three-dimensional flow of a polytropic gas. The two-equation k-omega turbulence model is used to model the unresolved turbulent scales and their influence on the mean solution. The finite-volume spatial discretization is accomplished by using a finite-volume procedure on multiblock, body-fitted, hexahedral mesh. The inviscid flux functions make use of Roe's approximate Riemann solver. The viscous flux is evaluated using a diamond path reconstruction procedure on each cell boundary. Verification and validation of the solution method is accomplished through the application of the algorithm to a number of flow problems. The results from the application of the solution method to the flow problems are in good agreement with available experimental data. Therefore, the validity of the solution method for solving three-dimensional, turbulent flows is confirmed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hybrid Plasmonic Waveguides and Devices: Theory, Modeling and Experimental Demonstration</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sun, Xiao</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis prompt a theoretical analysis of the hybrid plasmonic waveguide (HPWG) and a TE-pass polarizer based on HPWG has been designed, fabricated and characterized. A combination of low propagation loss, high power density, and large confinement is useful for many applications. The analysis results in this thesis show that the HPWG offers a better compromise between loss and confinement as compared to pure plasmonic waveguides. Another interesting property of the HPWG is its polarization diversity. In the HPWG the transverse electric and the transverse magnetic modes reside in different layers. We have designed a very compact hybrid TE-pass polarizer using this property. The polarizer was fabricated and characterized. The device shows low insertion loss for the TE mode with a high extinction ratio at telecommunication wavelength range for a 30 µm long HPWG section. Its performance compares favorably against previously reported silicon based integrated optic TE-pass polarizers.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Self-referencing and Sensitivity Optimization in Photonic Crystal Slabs for Biosensing Applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Schilling, Ryan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Photonic crystal slabs (PCS) are explored in the context of optofluidic refractive index (RI) sensing for portable, label-free, biosensing applications. The accuracy of RI sensors is limited by noise signals that cause a change in RI that cannot be differentiated from the signal of interest. For this reason self-referencing schemes that provide rejection of common mode signals, and an inherent temperature stabilization approach, are explored. A novel referencing method that allows for frequency shifts to be read out in the transmission power spectrum is proposed and characterized. In terms of improving sensing metrics the relevant characteristics of various PCS architectures are explored numerically. In addition, a novel suspended \emph{air-substrate} device that offers greatly improved sensitivity is proposed and characterized. An experimental measurement near the theoretical detection limit for a PCS is demonstrated. In understanding measurement errors the crossed-polarization effect and its practical limitations are explored numerically.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nonlinear and Ultrafast Optical Probing of Nanoscale MnAs and Graphitic Films</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Dean, Jesse Jackson</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis reports on ultrafast linear and nonlinear optical probing of nanometer thick films. Exfoliated graphene and few-layer graphite are probed through optical second harmonic generation (SHG) with 800 nm, 150 fs pulses. Samples of varying thickness from 1 carbon layer to bulk graphite are deposited onto an oxidized silicon substrate. SHG measurements are taken as a function of azimuthal rotation angle of the films. It is found that the SHG from graphene is much weaker than that from bilayer graphene, and has a qualitatively different azimuthal pattern. As the sample thickness increases from bilayer graphene to bulk graphite, the SHG yield generally decreases. Both of these effects are explained in terms of the symmetry of graphene and graphite, and modeled using multilayer optical transfer matrices, and an identical set of nonlinear susceptibility tensor elements for the front and back surfaces. These tensors are independent of sample thickness. MnAs films of 150 and 190 nm thickness on (001)GaAs are optically excited with 775 nm, 200 fs pump pulses. Specular SHG at 388 nm and first order optical diffraction at ∼ 400 nm are used to probe the samples on timescales up to 2 μs. It is found that the SHG probes the temperature-dependent, spatially averaged, surface strain. This strain reaches a maximum deviation in ∼ 6–100 ps after optical excitation depending on the pump fluence and initial temperature. The strain then recovers in hundreds of picoseconds, a timescale consistent with heat diffusion. The optical diffraction probes the first Fourier component of the paramagnetic–ferromagnetic stripes inherent to MnAs films in the 10–40◦C temperature range. After optical excitation, the diffraction data show highly nonthermal behaviour in the MnAs films. If a sample is excited from the coexistence phase, the diffraction signal shows decaying oscillations with a period of ∼ 335±4 (408±4) ps for the 150 (190) nm films; this is consistent with the release of a standing acoustic wave. Decay occurs on a timescale of ∼ 2 ns consistent with local diffusion through the films. The stripes are restored on a timescale of hundreds of nanoseconds, with a temporal behavior consistent with a diffusion process, possibly thermal in origin.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Interplay between Spin-orbit Coupling, Electronic Correlations and Lattice Distortions in Perovskite Iridates</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Delisle Carter, Jean-Michel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis focuses on the interplay of the spin-orbit coupling, the electronic correlations and the bandwidth energy scales, along with the lattice distortions seen in perovskite iridates. In particular, we study the magnetic phases in these materials and the insulator to metal transition that occurs as the dimensionality of the system is changed. Motivated by the novel magnetic phases seen in the Sr2IrO4 system, we study the band structures of three materials in the Sr(n+1)Ir(n)O(3n+1) Ruddlesden-Popper series by use of a tight-binding model. From the effect of spin-orbit coupling, we see that the relevant bands near the Fermi energy are indeed made of effective J=1/2 states. This spin-orbit separation of the bands creates effectively smaller bandwidth which can then be split via magnetic ordering driven by electronic correlations. By the use of a self-consistent mean-field theory, we derive the ordering for each of the three materials studied and show that the nature of the magnetic ordering is highly dependent on the lattice structure. The ordering in the bilayer Sr3Ir2O7, which has been a topic of debate in recent experimental studies, is understood within the current approach to be a collinear antiferromagnetic order, in agreement with the latest results. Given that the iridate systems have large spin-orbit coupling, and that the topic of topological insulators has become a very popular subject of research, we discuss the proximity of the perovskite iridates to topological insulators. Since the SrIrO3 material displays a semimetal structure with nodal dispersion near the Fermi level, we looked at an extra term in the Hamiltonian that could lift the nodal lines and turn the system into an insulator. Further studies of the parity eigenvalues of the bands at each time reversal invariant momentum point confirms that for a range of this extra term, a topological phase can be achieved. A discussion on material realization of such a phase is also given where we suggest that a Sr2IrRhO6 superstructure might be a good candidate to achieve this state.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>High Precision Cosmology with CMB Data</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Farhang, Marzieh</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis we investigate the two cosmic epochs of inflation and recombination, through their imprints on the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation. To probe the early universe we develop a map-based maximum-likelihood estimator to measure the amplitude of inflation-induced gravity waves, parametrized by $r$, from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization maps. Being optimal by construction, the estimator avoids $E$-$B$ mixing, a possible source of contamination in the tiny $B$-mode detection, the target of many current and near future CMB experiments. For various observational cases, we probe the dependence of $r$ measurement on the signal from different scales of $E$ and $B$ polarization. We make forecasts for Spider-like and Planck-like experimental specifications and to investigate the sky-coverage optimization of the Spider-like case. We also use a novel information-based framework to compare how different generations of CMB experiments reveal information about the early universe, through their measurements of $r$. We also probe the epoch of recombination by investigating possible fluctuations in the free electron fraction $\Xe$ around the fiducial model of the standard recombination scenario. Though theoretically well studied, the detailed assumptions in the recombination history, based on standard atomic physics, have never been directly tested. However, for our CMB-based cosmological inferences to be reliable, the recombination scenario needs to be observationally verified. We approach this problem in a model-independent way and construct rank-ordered parameter eigen-modes with the highest power to probe $\Xe$. We develop an information-based criterion to truncate the eigen-mode hierarchy, which can be used in similar hierarchical model selections as well. The method is applied to simulations of Planck+ACTPol and a cosmic variance limited survey with differing simulated recombination histories and recovered $\Xe$ trajectories are constructed. We apply the method to currently available CMB datasets, WMAP9+ACT/SPT. The first constructed eigen-mode turns out to be a direct measure of the damping envelope. Its current measurement with SPT slightly indicates a damping tail anomaly, while ACT data agree well with the standard scenario. High resolution Planck data will resolve this tension with high significance.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nonlinear Quantum Optics in Artificially Structured Media</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Helt, Lukas Gordon</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents an analysis of photon pairs generated via either spontaneous parametric downconversion or spontaneous four-wave mixing in channel waveguides as well as in microring resonators side-coupled to channel waveguides. The state of photons exiting a particular device is calculated within a general Hamiltonian formalism that simplifies the link between quantum nonlinear optics experiments and classical nonlinear optics experiments. This state contains information regarding photon pair production efficiency as well as modal and spectral correlations between the two photons, characterized by a two-dimensional spectral distribution function called the biphoton wave function. In the limit of a low probability of pair production, photon pair production fficiencies are cast into forms resembling corresponding well-known classical nonlinear optical frequency conversion efficiencies, making it easy to see what plays the role of a classical “seed” field in an un-seeded (quantum) process. This also allows photon pair production efficiencies to be calculated based on the results of classical nonlinear optical experiments. It is further calculated that, unless enerated photons are collected over a very narrow frequency range, their generation efficiency does not scale the same way with device length in a channel waveguide, or resonance quality factor in a microring resonator, as might be expected from the corresponding classical frequency conversion efficiency. Although calculations do not include self- or cross-phase modulation, nor two-photon absorption or free-carrier absorption, it is calculated that their neglect is justified in the low pair production probability limit. Linear (scattering) loss is also neglected, though partially addressed in the final chapter of this thesis. Biphoton wave functions are calculated explicitly, such that their shape and orientation, including approximate analytic expressions for their widths, can easily be determined. This further allows estimation of the suitability of their associated photon pairs for various quantum information processing applications. As an alternative to dispersion engineering a channel waveguide photon pair source, it is calculated that microring resonators can very naturally produce nearly spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs, which behave very much like idealized single-mode photons and are thus useful for applications involving the interference of photons from multiple sources.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Interplay between Electron Correlations and Quantum Orders in the Hubbard Model</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Witczak-Krempa, William</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We discuss the appearance of quantum orders in the Hubbard model for interacting electrons, at half-filling. Such phases do not have local order parameters and need to be characterized by the quantum mechanical properties of their ground state. On one hand, we study the Mott transition from a metal to a spin liquid insulator in two dimensions, of potential relevance to some layered organic compounds. The correlation-driven transition occurs at fixed filling and involves fractionalization of the electron: upon entering the insulator, a Fermi surface of neutral spinons coupled to an internal gauge field emerges. We focus on the transport properties near the quantum critical point and find that the emergent gauge fluctuations play a key role in determining the universal scaling. Second, motivated by a class of three-dimensional transition metal oxides, the pyrochlore iridates, we study the interplay of non-trivial band topology and correlations. Building on the strong spin orbit coupling in these compounds, we construct a general microscopic Hubbard model and determine its mean-field phase diagram, which contains topological insulators, Weyl semimetals, axion insulators and various antiferromagnets. We also discuss the effects many-body correlations on theses phases. We close by examining a fractionalized topological insulator that combines the two main themes of the thesis: fractionalization and non-trivial band topology. Specifically, we study how the two-dimensional protected surface states of a topological Mott insulator interact with a three-dimensional emergent gauge field. Various correlation effects on observables are identified.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Controlling the Properties of 2D Chiral Fermions and Local Moments in Graphene</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Killi, Matthew P.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The primary subject of this thesis is graphene and how the rudimentary attributes of its charge carriers, and local moments on its surface, can be directly manipulated and controlled with electrostatic potentials. We first consider bilayer graphene subject to a spatially varying electrostatic potential that forms two neighbouring regions with opposite interlayer bias. Along the boundary, 1D chiral `kink' states emerge. We find that these 1D modes behave as a strongly interacting Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid whose properties can be tuned via an external gate. Next, we consider superlattices in bilayer graphene. Superlattices are seen to have a more dramatic effect on bilayer graphene than monolayer graphene because the quasiparticles are changed in a fundamental way; the dispersion goes from a quadratic band touching point to linearly dispersing Dirac cones. We illustrate that a 1D superlattice of either the chemical potential or an interlayer bias generates multiple anisotropic Dirac cones. General arguments delineate how certain symmetries protect the Dirac points. We then map the Hamiltonian of an interlayer bias superlattice onto a coupled chain model comprised of `topological' edge modes. We then discuss the relevance of spatially varying potentials to recent transport measurements. This is followed by another study that considers the effect of a magnetic field on graphene superlattices. We show that magnetotransport measurements in a weak perpendicular (orbital) magnetic field probe the number of emergent Dirac points and reveal further details about the dispersion. In the case of bilayer graphene, we also discuss the properties of kink states in an applied magnetic field. We then consider the implications of these results with regards to scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, valley filtering, and impurity induced breakdown of the quantum Hall effect. Finally, we investigate local moment formation of adatoms on bilayer graphene using an Anderson impurity model. We construct various phase diagrams and discuss their many unusual features. We identify regions where the local moments can be turned on or off by applying a external electric fields. Finally, we compute the RKKY interaction between local moments and show how it too can be controlled with electric fields.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Femtosecond Laser Fabrication of Optimized Multilayered Volume Diffractive Optical Elements</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ng, Mi Li</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Diffractive optical elements (DOEs) serve an important function in many dynamic and static optical systems. The theory and design of surface diffractive structures are well understood and practically applied at high spatial and phase resolution for a wide range of optical applications in science and industry. However, these structures normally only harness phase modulation of uniform fields for the beam diffraction and therefore limit their range of application, as well as being susceptible to surface damage. Multilayered volume diffractive elements offer a powerful opportunity to harness both phase and amplitude modulation for benefits in diffraction efficiency and beam shaping. However, multilayered combinations have been difficult to fabricate and provide only weak diffraction for phase gratings with low refractive index contrast. The advent of femtosecond laser writing inside transparent media has enabled the facile embedding of optical devices such as waveguides and diffractive optics into novel three-dimensional geometries that offer advanced functionality with compact design. In this work, femtosecond laser writing is pushed to the limits of forming high resolution phase elements with sufficiently strong refractive index contrast on which to develop volume phase gratings with the highest diffractive efficiency. The formation of both positive and negative zones of refractive index contrast together with rapid Talbot self imaging inside weakly contrasting phase gratings are major challenges here diminish the efficiency of assembled gratings. A method of strategic layering of otherwise weakly diffracting gratings onto Talbot planes is introduced to demonstrate, in FDTD models, the definitive enhancement of overall diffraction efficiency. A systematic optimization of laser writing in fused silica verify this enhancement or diminishment with weak volume gratings assembled on aligned or misaligned on Talbot planes. Advanced laser beam control methods were further demonstrated that underpin new direction for the facile assembly of highly functional DOEs that can exploit coherent light diffraction for opportunities in improving the performance of holographic devices and extend further to the powerful combination of phase and amplitude modulation control that is potentially available in a single optical device, thereby opening new directions for the design and fabrication of robust and strongly diffracting volume optical devices.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Search for New Phenomena with the Mono-jet Signature, and a Direct Measurement of the Z Boson Invisible Width, with the ATLAS Detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rezvani, Reyhaneh</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A search for new physics in events with an energetic jet and large missing transverse momentum is performed with the ATLAS detector, using 2011 dataset corresponding to 4.7 fb−1 integrated luminosity. A model–independent approach is adopted, making predictions in various kinematic regions sensitive to potentially new physics scenarios. Data–driven background determination methods are developed to obtain robust predictions of the Standard Model expectations of the number of events in each probed kinematic region. No deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed, and the results are hence interpreted in the context of the ADD scenario of Large Extra Dimensions, and pair production of WIMP dark matter candidates. This results in the world’s tightest constraints on the size of the D-dimensional Planck scale as the fundamental parameter of the ADD theory. The constraints obtained on Dark Matter suppression scale are stronger than those obtained from dedicated direct and indirect dark matter experiments for a large range of WIMP masses. Furthermore, data-driven estimates of various Standard Model processes contributing to the mono-jet final state allows a precise direct measurement of the invisible decay width of the Z boson. This results in a measurement at 5% precision level, comparable to the results of the L3 experiment, and better than all other LEP direct measurements.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Modeling Three-dimensional Flow and Heat Transfer in Variable Surface Tension Two-phase Flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Samareh Abolhassani, Babak</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the present study a parallel three dimensional Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is developed to simulate Marangoni force in immiscible fluids with variable surface tension. Conservation equations are solved based on cell-averaged one-field volume tracking scheme. Evaluating the convective term in the energy equation along the boundary between the fluids highly depends on the position and orientation of the interface; hence, using average cell values simply ignores the interface shape and leads to computational uncertainty. As a remedy to this issue, the original idea behind the volume tracking method is used not only to advect mass and momentum but also energy across cells. To verify the proposed algorithm, results are compared against theoretically predicted thermocapillary migration velocity of a droplet at the limit of zero Marangoni number. However, at relatively high Marangoni numbers, thermal boundary layers are very thin and challenging to resolve. To demonstrate the capabilities of the heat transfer module, simulations of a Fluorinert droplet moving in silicon oil under applied temperature gradient in microgravity are compared against the available experimental results and the migration velocity of the droplet are reported.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nonlinear Microscopy for Histology</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tuer, Adam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Histology has long recognized the intimate link between structure and function. Over centuries histologists have utilized an assortment of optical microscopy techniques to elucidate functional attributes of tissues through investigating tissue architecture. This thesis includes developments in the field of nonlinear optical microscopy for use in histology and pathology. The main contributions focused on the study of fibrillar collagen in the extracellular matrix (ECM) with polarization-dependent second harmonic generation (P-SHG) microscopy and the study of harmonophore-stained cellular nuclei with third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy. The P-SHG microscopy technique, “polarization-in, polarization-out” (PIPO), was developed to accurately determine the second-order polarization properties of thin tissue sections. The polarization instrumentation was implemented into a nonlinear optical microscope and a custom fitting algorithm extracted ratios of the second-order nonlinear susceptibility elements at every pixel of an obtained image. Hierarchical organization, at every level of structure, can contribute significantly to the macroscopic second-order polarization properties of fibrillar collagen in the ECM and quantifiable differences between the various tissue architectures were observed. A framework was developed, based on the collagen hierarchical organization, to interpret the submicron polarization properties of various tissues. Complimentary to the P-SHG study of connective tissue, the structure of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained nuclei was revealed by THG microscopy. Imaging the 3D organization of nuclei was possible using the inherent optical sectioning provided by nonlinear microscopy. The origin of THG was investigated with spectrally- and temporally-resolved measurements, as well as the THG ratio method. A rather complex situation involving multiple dye complexes was revealed. The structure of dye aggregates was investigated with THG PIPO microscopy. The techniques of PIPO and harmonophore-stained harmonic generation microscopy show great potential for ultimately furthering understanding of tissue structure and function. H&amp;E stained tissue investigations with THG microscopy has applications as a tool for cancer diagnostics. PIPO can elucidate the symmetry and organization of materials beyond tissues, including starch, nanowires, and protein crystals. In pathology, the developed collagen framework has strong implications, as collagen is recognized as playing a more active role in a number of diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, wound repair, and tumour development and progression.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Particle Definitions and the Information Loss Paradox</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Venditti, Alexander</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>An investigation of information loss in black hole spacetimes is performed. We demon- strate that the definition of particles as energy levels of the Harmonic oscillator will not have physical significance in general and is thus not a good instrument to study the ra- diation of black holes. This is due to the ambiguity of the choice of coordinates on the phase space of the quantum field. We demonstrate how to identify quantum states in the functional Schr ̈dinger picture. o We demonstrate that information is truly lost in the case of a Vaidya black hole (a black hole formed from null dust) if we neglect back reaction. This is done by quantizing the constrained classical system of a Klein-Gordon field in a Vaidya background. The interaction picture of quantum mechanics can be applied to this system. We find a physically well motivated vacuum state for a spherically symmetric space- time with an extra conformal Killing vector. We also demonstrate how to calculate the response of a particle detector in the a LeMaitre-Tolman-Bondi spacetime with a self- similarity. Finally, some of the claims and confusion surrounding Unruh radiation, Hawking radiation and the equivalence principle are investigated and shown to be false.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Quantum Light Source for Light-matter Interaction</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Xing, Xingxing</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>I present in this thesis the design, implementation and measurement results of a narrowband quantum light source based on cavity-enhanced Parametric Down-Conversion (PDC). Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is the workhorse in the field of optical quantum information and quantum computation, yet it is not suitable for applications where deterministic nonlinearities are required due to its low spectral brightness. By placing the nonlinear crystal inside a cavity, the spectrum of down-conversion is actively modified, such that all the non-resonant modes of down-conversion experience destructive interference, while the resonant mode sees constructive interference, resulting in great enhancement in spectral brightness. I design and construct such a cavity-enhanced down-conversion source with record high spectral brightness, making it possible to use cold atoms as the interaction medium to achieve large nonlinearity between photons. The frequency of the photons is tunable and their coherence time is measured to be on the order of 10 nanoseconds, matching the lifetime of the excited state of typical alkali atoms. I characterize extensively the output of the source by measuring the second-order correlation function, quantifying two-photon indistinguishability, performing quantum state tomography of entangled states, and showing different statistics of the source. The unprecedented long coherence time of the photon pairs has also made possible the encoding of quantum information in the time domain of the photons. I present a theoretical proposal of multi-dimensional quantum information with such long-coherence-time photons and analyze its performance with realistic parameter settings. I implement this proposal with the quantum light source I have built, and show for the first time that a qutrit can be encoded in the time domain of the single photons. I demonstrate the coherence is preserved for the qutrit state, thus ruling out any classical probabilistic explanation of the experimental data. Such an encoding scheme provides an easy access to multi-dimensional systems and can be used as a versatile platform for many quantum information and quantum computation tasks.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hierarchical Semiconductor, Metal and Hybrid Nanostructures and the Study of their Light-matter Interactions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lee, Anna</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The work presented in this thesis explores the optical properties of hierarchical structures composed of nanoscale building blocks ranging from metals to semiconductors and composites, organized through bottom-up design methods. 1) By following the dynamic generation of hot-spots in self-assembled chains of gold nanorods (NRs), we have established a direct correlation between ensemble-averaged surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and extinction properties of these nanoscale chains. Experimental results were supported by comprehensive finite-difference time-domain simulations (FDTD). The relationship established between the structure of nanorod ensembles and their optical properties provides a basis for producing dynamic, solution-based, plasmonic platforms for applications ranging from sensing to nanoelectronics. 2) We report theoretical and experimental analyses of the optical properties of side-by-side assembled gold NRs. Comprehensive FDTD simulations showed a blue shift of the surface plasmon resonance in the side-by-side assembled NR structures and a reduction of electric field intensity as the number of NRs per stack increased. These results were experimentally verified via extinction measurements and ensemble-averaged SERS spectroscopy. The experimental results and electrodynamic simulations were found to be in agreement. 3) The efficacy of hollow core photonic crystal fibers (HCPCF) as a platform for SERS spectroscopy was demonstrated. SERS measurements carried out using this platform showed the capability to monitor minute amounts of ligands on the surface of gold nanoparticles and SERS signals from HCPCF exhibited a 10-fold enhancement. Using the exchange of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide with α-methoxy-ω mercaptopolyethylene glycol on the surface of gold nanorods as an exemplary system, we showed the feasibility of using HCPCF SERS to monitor the change in surface chemistry of NRs. 4) Facile, solution-phase formation of ordered, lamellar quantum dot (QD) arrays exhibiting structural integrity and temporal stability, without the need for chemical crosslinking, was achieved. While micrometers in diameter, they are typically only two to three QD layers thick. These structures are capable of carrying a cargo of water-soluble ions, molecules, metal nanoparticles, or biomolecules. The photoluminescence of the host CdSe QDs were enhanced by the encapsulation of gold nanoparticles within the lamellae, demonstrating the ability to modulate their properties through the cargo they carry. 5) This chapter explores a bottom-up method to produce a metamaterial designed to function as an optical cloak in the visible range. A composite material consisting of an array of silver nanowires (NWs) in a dielectric host has been produced based on the theory of a non-magnetic optical cloak. The required radial array of silver NWs was achieved by electroless deposition of the metal into the channels of a porous alumina structure grown perpendicularly from the curved surface of a micrometer scale aluminum wire. The functionality of the cloak was demonstrated by partial cloaking in the visible range (540 nm).</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantum Transport in InAs Nanowires with Etched Constrictions and Local Side-gating</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ma, Yao</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>To study transport properties in single InAs nanowires (NW) with etched constrictions, a bunch of back-gated single InAs NW devices were made. The standard device contained a NW section with an etched constriction, placed between two pre-patterned side-gates. For comparison, devices either without etched constriction or without side-gates were also fabricated. Transport measurement results of three devices were presented and discussed. The device without side-gates exhibited Coulomb blockade due to electron tunneling through double quantum dots (QDs). The device without the etched constriction displayed conductance quantization. The standard device showed both Coulomb blockade (due to electron tunneling through either multiple QDs or single QD) and Fabry-Perot conductance oscillation at different gate bias regime. A 3-D electrostatic and 2-D eigenvalue coupled simulation was conducted to explain the observed conductance quantization. This model suggests that the nonuniform potential distribution in a thick NW dramatically modifies the confinement energies in the NW.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Numerical Model for Oil/water Separation from an Accelerating Oil-coated Solid Particle</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Abbas-Pour, Nima</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A computational fluid dynamics model has been developed to examine the separation of an oil film from a spherical oil-coated particle falling through quiescent water due to gravity. Using this model, the separation process was studied as a function of the viscosity ratio of oil to water, R, and the ratio of viscous forces to surface tension, represented by the Capillary number Ca. The governing equations of this flow-induced motion are derived in a non-inertial spherical coordinate system, and discretized using a finite volume approach. The Volume-of-Fluid method is used to capture the oil/water interface. The model predicts two mechanisms for oil separation: at R less than 1, the shear difference between the particle/oil interface and the oil/water interface is not significant and Ca determines whether separation occurs or not; at R larger than 1, the shear difference is considerable, and the Ca effect becomes less dominant.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Thermo-acoustic Velocity Coupling in a Swirl-stabilized Gas Turbine Model Combustor</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Caux-Brisebois, Vincent</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The research presented herein describes the coupling of acoustic and heat release fluctuations in a perfectly-premixed swirl-stabilized combustor by analysis of simultaneous high-repetition-rate laser diagnostics data. Nine cases are studied, varying the thermal power and the equivalence ratio. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the velocity data shows that cases with higher amplitude thermoacoustic oscillations have flow fields containing helical vortex cores (HVC); these cases are further analysed to determine the driving mechanisms of the oscillations. Flow and flame statistics are compiled as a function of both the phase in the thermoacoustic cycle and a phase representing the azimuthal position of the HVC relative to the measurement plane. These data are used to spatially map the thermoacoustic energy transfer field, as described by the Rayleigh integral. It is found that periodic deformations of the HVC cause large-scale flame motions, resulting in regions of positive and negative energy transfer.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Chen, Chao-Yang</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The electrical properties of nanowire-based n-InSb-n-InAs heterojunctions grown by chemical beam epitaxy were investigated both theoretically and experimentally. This heterostructure presented a type-III band alignment with the band bendings at 0.12 eV for InAs side and 0.16 − 0.21 eV in InSb. Analysis of the temperature dependent current voltage characteristics showed that the current through the heterojunction is caused mostly by generation-recombination processes in the InSb and at the heterointerface. Due to the partially overlapping valence band of InSb and the conduction band of InAs, the second process was fast and activationless. Theoretical analysis showed that, depending on the heterojunction parameters, the flux of non-equilibrium minority carriers may have a different direction, explaining the experimentally observed non-monotonic coordinate dependence of the electron beam induced current at the vicinity of heterointerface.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Investigation of the Flow Topology around a Simplified Two-wheel Landing Gear with Emphasis on the Stagnation Point</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Feltham, Graham</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Experiments were conducted in a recirculating water channel to determine the flow topology around a simplified two-wheel landing gear model. Both hydrogen bubble visualization and Particle Image Velocimetry techniques were employed. The Reynolds number based on wheel diameter was 32,500. The general flow topology was characterized for several wheel configurations. Previously undiscovered structures have been found in several regions of the flow field, and their behavior was found to depend strongly on the geometry of the wheels. The phenomena of vorticity amplification near the stagnation point of the wheels was also studied. Weak upstream vorticity was found to collect, grow, and amplify into large coherent structures which then shed in a regular manner. The size, location, and shedding frequency of these structures has been characterized. The impingement point of the upstream vorticity was found to dictate the dynamics of the phenomena.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This thesis presents the design and development of a novel two-axis micromirror utilizing electrostatic, repulsive-force rotational actuators for laser scanned vector display systems. The micromirror consists of a 1.0 mm reflective mirror plate that can be rotated at high speeds to steer a laser beam to generate images. Fabricated using PolyMUMPs, the micromirror is operated in a non-resonant mode between 0 V and 200 V and can achieve a maximum optical scanning angle of ±2.6° in each axis with a settling time as fast as 2.75 ms and a first resonant frequency of 1400 Hz. Open-loop control methods were developed for image correcting and improving image quality. The micromirror was integrated into a portable, handheld vector display device which included designing and developing driving circuits, device firmware, mechanical components and optical components.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Photosynthetic-plasmonic-voltaics: Plasmonically Excited Biofilms for Electricity Production</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Samsonoff, Nathan George</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Photosynthetic biofilms have much higher cell density than suspended cultures and when grown in a stacked waveguide configuration, can have orders of magnitude higher areal productivity. Evanescent and plasmonic growth of biofilm cultures have been demonstrated, solving issues with light penetration impeding growth, but thus far the technology has been limited to biofuel production applications. In this thesis, plasmonically excited cyanobacterial biofilms are used to produce electrical power in a photosynthetic-plasmonic-voltaic device. This approach uses red lasers to deliver light to cells via an optical waveguide through the generation of surface plasmons at the interface between a metal and dielectric, in this case a glass-gold-air interface. This gold film serves a dual purpose as a current collector for electrons generated at the cell surface. Experiments presented here demonstrate positive power output light response under both direct light and plasmonic excitation and produced equivalent power output of 6 uW/m2 under similar light power intensities.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Arrays of Silicon P-i-N Nanowires for Antenna-enhanced and Polarisation Sensitive Detection of Light</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Stewart, Corey</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A novel antenna effect is demonstrated in arrays of 500, 200 and 100 silicon nanowires embedded in silicon dioxide. The gratings are analyzed using spectral and polarisation resolved photocurrent microscopy. Resonant enhancements in the electric field and photocurrent response are observed at multiple wavelengths corresponding to coupling of incident radiation into the grating's multiple-scattering electromagnetic modes. The photoresponse retains the sinusoidal polarisation anisotropy expected in single nanowires. The resonances are modeled using electromagnetic scattering theory and show excellent agreement with measurement. An experimental quality factor of Q=10 was measured for the gratings, exceeding that of a single wire, but lower than expected from theory. The difference is ascribed to the finite length of the wires and their termination at ohmic contacts. Strategies to improve Q are discussed, and a grating is presented to resonantly enhance light detection at red, green and blue wavelengths for application as a colour imaging sensor.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Sources of Error in Image-based Computational Fluid Dynamics Modeling of Common Carotid Arteries</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Khan, Muhammad Owais</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Magnetic resonance imaging is often used as a source for reconstructing vascular anatomy for the purpose of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. We recently observed large discrepancies in such “image-based” CFD models of the normal common carotid artery (CCA) derived from contrast enhanced MR angiography (CEMRA). A novel quantitative comparison of velocity profile shape of N=20 cases revealed an average 25% overestimation of velocities by CFD, attributed to a corresponding underestimation of lumen area in the CEMRA-derived geometries. We hypothesized that this was due to blurring of edges in the images caused by dilution of contrast agent during the relatively long elliptic centric CEMRA acquisitions, and confirmed this with MRI simulations. CFD simulations incorporating realistic inlet velocity profiles and non-Newtonian rheology had a negligible effect on velocity profile skewing, suggesting a role for other sources of error or modeling assumptions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental Testing of Low Reynolds Number Airfoils for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Li, Leon</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This work is focused on the aerodynamics for a proprietary laminar flow airfoil for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications. The two main focuses are (1) aerodynamic performance at Reynolds number on the order of 10,000, (2) the effect of a conventional hot-wire probe on laminar separation bubbles. For aerodynamic performance, pressure and wake velocity distributions were measured at Re = 40,000 and 60,000 for a range of angles of attack. The airfoil performed poorly for these Reynolds numbers due to laminar boundary layer separation. 2-D boundary layer trips significantly improved the lift-to-drag ratio. For probe effects, three Reynolds numbers were investigated (Re = 100,000, 150,000, and 200,000), with three angles of attack for each. Pressure and surface shear distributions were measured. Flow upstream of the probe tip was not affected. Transition was promoted downstream due to the additional disturbances in the separated shear layer.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Lukat, Tricia</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Imaging of the osseous structures of the temporomandibular joint is best accomplished using computed tomography (CT). Cone beam CT offers a reduced radiation dose and improved spatial resolution compared to multislice helical CT. This study evaluates comparative dosimetry for temporomandibular joint imaging using two different cone beam CT systems, the Hitachi CB MercuRay and Kodak 9000 3D. These systems demonstrate differing properties with respect to field-of view sizes, operational technique factors, and spatial resolution. The Kodak 9000 3D unit offers an effective radiation dose reduction of greater than ten-fold compared with the Hitachi CB MercuRay, depending on kVp and mA. A subsequent clinical study evaluating the effect of spatial resolution on the ability to detect osseous changes related to temporomandibular joint degenerative disease found no significant difference in diagnostic efficacy between high and low spatial resolution images, however, observers consistently associated high spatial resolution with superior image quality.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Investigation of Light-harvesting Dynamics of Photosynthetic Pigment-protein Complexes using Ultrafast Spectroscopy</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>McClure, Scott</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We investigate the ultrafast electronic excitation dynamics of phycobiliproteins from cryptophyte algae using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy and frequency-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. We detail the development of a transient absorption spectrometer that utilizes balanced and fast detection methods to reduce noise and maintain high temporal and spectral resolution. We observe coherent oscillations and attribute them to vibrational coherences using the wave packet formalism. Analysis of the dynamic Stokes shift and motion of the wave packet on the potential-energy surface indicate the coherences are predominantly situated in the excited electronic state of the protein. These measurements imply that the ultrafast energy transfer within phycobiliproteins is coupled to the vibrational motion of its constituent chromophores. We demonstrate the capability and necessity of multiple ultrafast spectroscopic techniques for determining the origin of coherent motion in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dynamic Linkage Between Local Cross-frequency Coupling and Communication Through Coherence in an in Vitro Model of Human Neocortical Oscillatory Activity</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>McGinn, Ryan J.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The dynamical underpinnings of complex computation and information transmission within the brain, while of great interest to the neuroscience community at large, remain poorly understood. One of the striking manifestations of neuronal population activity is that of rhythmic oscillations in the local field potential. It is thought that distinct patterns of these oscillations such as cross-frequency coupling within a given spatial location and coherence between disparate brain regions may represent neuronal computation and communication, respectively. Here we show such dynamics within a human temporal neocortical in vitro model. In specific, we show theta-gamma cross frequency coupling in deep and superficial layers, phase coherence between layers at theta frequencies, and a measure of communication (phase dependent power correlations) between layers at theta frequency. Additionally, we show a novel correlation between communication across layers and cross frequency coupling within layers, demonstrating a dynamic link between local computation and intralaminar communication.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Improving the Detection Limit of Planar 2D Photonic Crystal Slab Refractive Index Sensors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Nicholaou, Costa</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Two dimensional photonic crystal slabs are studied theoretically and experimentally for the application of refractive index sensing with a focus on increasing both quality factor and sensitivity simultaneously. An overview of simulation and experimental techniques, along with fabrication protocols used is given. Through the use of new wafer architectures which allow for an air substrate, sensitivity is enhanced in some cases by more than a factor of 2 from our previous studies. Combining this with a novel lattice proposed which greatly reduces fabrication tolerances, experimental quality factors above 10,500 are achieved while maintaining an experimental sensitivity of above 800 nm/RIU. The effects of a finite photonic crystal slab are studied through the group velocity of guided mode resonances, with an emphasis on zero-group velocity. Future applications of the designs proposed are discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Harmonic Oscillations in Optical Waveguide Arrays</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wu, Jianxiong</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The analogy of optical system to other physical systems has been attracting much attention over the past decades. In coupled optical lattices, phenomena originated from electronic systems, such as Bloch oscillations, Dynamic localization and Zener tunneling, have been extensively investigated and led to novel research directions and applications. Following this idea, harmonic oscillations are spatially mimicked by the propagation of supermodes in quadratically-coupled waveguide arrays. By analyzing the field envelope with the propagation constants and the superposition of the supermodes, we achieve conjugate-imaging at the half-period plane and self-imaging at the full-period plane, which give rise to the linear switching. Combining the linear switching and the nonlinear light propagation triggered at high power level, we demonstrate the superior performances of nonlinear power switching compared with traditional nonlinear directional couplers. Through the linear and nonlinear observation on AlGaAs waveguide array, we present the first experimental proof of the harmonic oscillations in optical waveguide arrays.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Modeling, Fabrication, and Characterization of a Bragg Slot Waveguide with a Cavity</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yagnyukova, Mariya</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis encompasses a theoretical analysis, the fabrication, and optical characterization of a novel compact Bragg Slot Waveguide with a Cavity (BSWC). Strong light confinement in the low refractive index slot region formed by two silicon slabs on a silicon dioxide substrate [1] makes this structure useful for optofluidic, sensing, and optical trapping applications. The transmission spectrum of the BSWC can be engineered through the dimensional variations of the waveguide and through the refractive index change of the surrounding medium. BSWC is compact and can be integrated with various components on a chip for increased functionality. The results in this thesis show a good agreement between analytical and experimental results, while emphasizing the increasing importance of atomic-scale imperfections as a result of fabrication on the nano-scale. The impact of the slot width, slab width, and the cavity length on the waveguide transmission spectrum is investigated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Dimmable LED Driver For Visible Light Communication Based On the LLC Resonant Converter</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhao, Shuze</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This work presents a new wireless Visible Light Communication lighting system targeted to future Smart Buildings. A digitally controlled LLC resonant dc-dc converter targeted to white LED luminaires is demonstrated. Visible Light Communication is implemented with minimal incremental cost, by operating the LLC converter in burst mode, without causing any visible disturbance. The converter operates with a regulated average LED current by adjusting the switching frequency, while the burst pulse timing is controlled to minimize the current disturbance and minimize the value of the output capacitor. Variable Pulse Position Modulation is used to modulate the data, while supporting a range of dimming settings. A digital demodulation scheme that supports variable frequency transmission is demonstrated. The 80 W, 400 V to 23 V converter experimental prototype has a peak efficiency of 93.8 %. The bit error rate of the complete system is fully characterized versus distance and angle.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Influence of Crystalline Microstructure on Optical Response of Single ZnSe Nanowires</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Saxena, Ankur</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) are anticipated to play a crucial role in future electronic and optoelectronic devices. Their practical applications remain hindered by an urging need for feasible strategies to tailor their optical and electronic properties. Strategies based on strain and alloying are limited by issues such as defects, interface broadening and alloy scattering. In this thesis, a novel method to engineer the optoelectronic properties based on strain-free periodic structural modulations in chemically homogeneous Nanowire Twinning Superlattices (NTSLs) is experimentally demonstrated. NTSLs are an emerging new class of nanoscale material, composed of periodically arranged rotation twin-planes along the length of NWs. The main objective of this thesis is to establish the relationship between the electronic energy band gap (Eg) and the twin-plane spacing (d) in NTSLs, quantified using a periodicity parameter, based on ZnSe. ZnSe was chosen because of its excellent luminescence properties, and potential in fabrication of optoelectronic devices in the near-UV and blue region of the spectrum. A prerequisite to establishing this correspondence is a prior knowledge of the photoluminescence (PL) response and the nature of fundamental optical transitions in defect-free single crystal ZnSe NWs with zinc-blende (ZB) and wurtzite (WZ) crystal structures. There has been no systematic work done yet on understanding these fundamental optical processes, particularly on single NWs and in relation to their crystalline microstructure. Therefore, the secondary objective of this thesis is to study the influence of native point defects on the optical response of single ZnSe NWs in direct relation to their crystalline microstructure. The PL response from single ZB and WZ NWs was determined unambiguously, and excitonic emission linewidths close to 1 meV were observed, which are the narrowest reported linewidths thus far on ZnSe NWs. Based on this and extensive optical and structural characterization on individual NTSLs, a linear variation in Eg is shown through a monotonic shift in PL peak position from ZnSe NTSLs as a function of d, with Eg's that lie between those of ZB and WZ crystal structures. This linear variation in Eg was also validated by ab Initio electronic structure calculations. This establishes NTSLs as new nanoscale polytypes advantageous for applications requiring tunable band gaps.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Exploring Matter-wave Dynamics with a Bose-Einstein Condensate</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chang, Rockson</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Bose-Einstein condensates of dilute gases provide a rich and versatile platform to study both single-particle and many-body quantum phenomena. This thesis describes several experiments using a Bose-Einstein condensate of Rb-87 as a model system to study novel matter-wave effects that traditionally arise in vastly different systems, yet are difficult to access. We study the scattering of a particle from a repulsive potential barrier in the non-asymptotic regime, for which the collision dynamics are on-going. Using a Bose-Einstein condensate interacting with a sharp repulsive potential, two distinct transient scattering effects are observed: one due to the momentary deceleration of particles atop the barrier, and one due to the abrupt discontinuity in phase written on the wavepacket in position-space, akin to quantum reflection. Both effects lead to a redistribution of momenta, resulting in a rich interference pattern that may be used to reconstruct the single-particle wavefunction. In a second experiment, we study the response of a particle in a periodic potential to an applied force. By abruptly applying an external force to a Bose-Einstein condensate in a one-dimensional optical lattice, we show that the initial response of a particle in a periodic potential is in fact characterized by the bare mass, and only over timescales long compared to that of interband dynamics is the usual effective mass an appropriate description. This breakdown of the effective mass description on fast timescales is difficult to observe in traditional solid state systems due to their large bandgaps and fast timescale of interband dynamics. Both these experiments make use of the condensate's long coherence length, and the ability to shape and modulate the external potential on timescales fast compared to the particle dynamics, allowing for observation of novel matter-wave effects.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Exotic Phases In Geometrically Frustrated Quantum Magnets</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Dodds, Tyler</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Quantum magnetic materials provide pathways to exotic spin-disordered phases. We study two broad classes of quantum spin systems and their ground states. The first class is that of spin-dimer systems, which form valence-bond-solid states. In such systems, competition between interactions among the dimers can lead to interesting magnetization behaviour. We explain the magnetization of Ba3Cr2O8 as a Bose-Einstein condensate of spin-carrying excitations. Furthermore, we investigate possible dimerized and nearby magnetically ordered states in the Shastry-Sutherland compound (CuCl)LaNb2O7. The second class of spin systems feature geometric frustration, which may stabilize spin-liquid states without any order or particular dimerization. We argue the proximity of the face-centred-cubic double perovskite La2LiMoO6 to such a phase, to explain its lack of long-range order. We argue for the coexistence of such a state, along with spiral magnetic order, to explain the anomalous thermodynamic measurements in the spin-density-wave phase of powder samples of Volborthite, a distorted kagome-lattice spin system. Finally, we study spin liquid phases that have spin correlations consistent with those found from inelastic neutron scattering of the disordered kagome-lattice material Herbertsmithite. We predict electron spin resonance absorption lineshapes associated with these phases.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Planetary Dynamo Models: Generation Mechanisms and the Influence of Boundary Conditions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Dharmaraj, Girija</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The Earth's magnetic field is generated in its fluid outer core through dynamo action. In this process, convection and differential rotation of an electrically conducting fluid maintain the magnetic field against its ohmic decay. Using numerical models, we can investigate planetary dynamo processes and the importance of various core properties on the dynamo. In this thesis, I use numerical dynamo models in Earth-like geometry in order to understand the influence of inner core electrical conductivity and the choice of thermal and velocity boundary conditions on the resulting magnetic field. I demonstrate how an electrically conducting inner core can reduce the frequency of reversals and produce axial-dipolar dominated fields in our models. I also demonstrate that a strong planetary magnetic field intensity does not imply that the dynamo operates in the strong field regime as is usually presumed. Through a scaling law analysis, I find that irrespective of the choice of thermal or velocity boundary conditions, the available power determines the magnetic and velocity field characteristics like the field strength, polarity and morphology. Also, whether a dynamo model is in a dipolar, transitional or multipolar regime is dependent on the force balance in the model. I demonstrate that the Lorentz force is balanced by the Coriolis force in the dipolar dynamo regime models resulting in magnetostrophically balanced dynamos whereas the Lorentz force is balanced by the Inertial force (and not the Coriolis force) in the multipolar dynamo regime models resulting in a non-magnetostrophically balanced dynamo. The generation mechanism differs between the regimes and depends on the velocity boundary conditions. The zonal flows of the stress-free models are stronger than in the no-slip models, and bistability is more prominent when stress-free boundary conditions are used. A single scaling law may be feasible for all the models, but there does appear to be some variation for models with different thermal and velocity boundary conditions. The results presented in this thesis are not only applicable to the geodynamo, but will also aid in understanding the dynamos of other planets and exoplanets.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>X-ray Spectroscopy Studies of Iridates and Iron Based Superconductors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gretarsson, Hlynur</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Ir L3 edge Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) and La2 Resonant X-ray Emission Spectroscopy (RXES) have been used to investigate A2IrO3 (A= Na or Li) and CuIr2S4. First principle calculations show that the low-energy dd-excitations in the RIXS spectra of A2IrO3 originate from a split jeff=3/2 to jeff=1/2 excitation. A magnetic excitation is observed in Na2IrO3, whose dispersion is consistent with the theoretical prediction including a bond-dependent Kitaev interaction between jeff=1/2 magnetic moments. In CuIr2S4, RXES measurements reveal that the unoccupied Ir t2g level shift upward in energy as a result of the metal-insulator transition, confirming density functional theory calculations. In the x-ray irradiation induced phase of CuIr2S4, a mid-infrared peak emerges in the RIXS spectrum around 0.4 eV, suggesting that both the crystal structure and the electronic structure are modified due to x-ray irradiation. The size of the magnetic moments in Fe based superconductors has been investigated using Fe Kb X-ray Emission Spectroscopy (XES). Local magnetic moments are found in Fe pnictides and chalcogenides, independent of temperature or carrier concentration. This result supports the notion of local moments coexisting with metallic bands. Our investigation of Ca{1-x}RExFe2As2 (RE=La, Pr, and Nd) shows results consistent with a spin-state transition. We argue that the gradual change of the spin-state over a wide temperature range reveals the importance of multiorbital physics, and in particular the competition between the crystal field split Fe 3d orbitals and the Hund's rule coupling.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>AdS/CFT, Black Holes, And Fuzzballs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zadeh, Aida</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis we investigate two different aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We first investigate the holographic AdS/CMT correspondence. Gravitational backgrounds in d+2 dimensions have been proposed as holographic duals to Lifshitz-like theories describing critical phenomena in d+1 dimensions with critical exponent z&gt;1. We numerically explore a dilaton-Einstein-Maxwell model admitting such backgrounds as solutions. We show how to embed these solutions into AdS space for a range of values of z and d. We next investigate the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence and focus on the microscopic CFT description of the D1-D5 system on T^4*S_1. In the context of the fuzzball programme, we investigate deforming the CFT away from the orbifold point and study lifting of the low-lying string states. We start by considering general 2D orbifold CFTs of the form M^N/S_N, with M a target space manifold and S_N the symmetric group. The Lunin-Mathur covering space technique provides a way to compute correlators in these orbifold theories, and we generalize this technique in two ways. First, we consider excitations of twist operators by modes of fields that are not twisted by that operator, and show how to account for these excitations when computing correlation functions in the covering space. Second, we consider non-twist sector operators and show how to include the effects of these insertions in the covering space. Using the generalization of the Lunin-Mathur symmetric orbifold technology and conformal perturbation theory, we initiate a program to compute the anomalous dimensions of low-lying string states in the D1-D5 superconformal field theory. Our method entails finding four-point functions involving a string operator O of interest and the deformation operator, taking coincidence limits to identify which other operators mix with O, subtracting conformal families of these operators, and computing their mixing coefficients. We find evidence of operator mixing at first order in the deformation parameter, which means that the string state acquires an anomalous dimension. After diagonalization this will mean that anomalous dimensions of some string states in the D1-D5 SCFT must decrease away from the orbifold point while others increase. Finally, we summarize our results and discuss some future directions of research.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Applications of Optical Spectroscopy in Studies on Energy and Electron Transfer and Solvation Effects in Nanoscale and Molecular Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Oh, Megan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis describes three investigations, ranging in subject matters, all of which relating to systems capable of photoinduced reactions involving energy or electron transfer. The phenomenon and the effects of environment in the various systems are explored using different methodologies of optical spectroscopy. As the chapters progress, different investigations introduce and build on fundamental concepts encountered and in complexity of the methodologies used to explore the systems. The first chapter introduces the preparation of water-soluble CdSe nanocrystal clusters. The clusters, created using a protein, are 3-D close-packed self-assemblies of nanocrystals. Due to this close-packed nature, electronic interactions between the nanocrystals allow for energy migration within the cluster. The structural and optical properties of the clusters were described. Then using steady-state spectroscopy, properties of the original nanocrystals were compared to that of the cluster to determine the consequence of nanocrystal coupling interactions and their potential use toward the development of artificial light-harvesting systems. In the second chapter, CdSe nanocrystals are functionalized with a unique electro-active polymer, and the electron transfer between the nanocrystal and the electro-active polymer adsorbate is investigated. Using fluorescence decay measurements, the electron transfer reaction inherent to the system with respect to a comprehensive range of dielectric solvents was explored. The study illustrates the high complexity of seemingly typical nanocrystal-based systems and provides general awareness of what factors need to be considered when dealing with such systems. The final chapter starts with an informal review of ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy, focusing on two methods, three-pulse photon echo peak shift (3PEPS) and two-dimensional photon echo (2DPE) electronic spectroscopy, and how they are related. A straightforward approach for extracting 3PEPS data from 2DPE results is presented in a preliminary case study of a dye in two different solvents, one of which is electron-donating.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>New Harmonic Generation Microscopy Techniques based on Focal Volume Modelling</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sandkuijl, Daaf</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Nonlinear microscopy has become an indispensable tool in the study of biological systems. It includes many nonlinear contrast mechanisms, each sensitive to different biological structures. However, interpretation of the images generated in nonlinear microscopy is a complex matter due to factors such as the structural complexity of the sample, phase relationships between the excitation beam and the detected signal and the nonlinear interactions in the focal volume of the microscope. This thesis contains a new theoretical and numerical framework that describes the focusing of an excitation beam in a nonlinear microscope, the nonlinear optical interactions with the material in the focal volume, and the resulting nonlinear optical signal in the far field. The framework is the first to include reflection and refraction of the excitation beam and nonlinear signals by an arbitrary number of interfaces in the focal volume, which is especially significant for the interpretation of third harmonic generation (THG). It also uses the chirp-z transform to speed up calculations by orders of magnitude compared to numerical integration techniques. The framework is used to investigate second harmonic generation (SHG) by collagen. Focusing effects alter polarization-dependent SHG measurements of collagen properties compared to the plane wave approximation, and this is verified experimentally. Furthermore, a technique of imaging the far field SHG radiation from collagen fibres is proposed, which can be used to extract the orientation of collagen fibres unambiguously. The framework is then applied to analyze the influence of interfaces on THG. Reflection effects at interfaces significantly affect THG, which leads to the development of a new super-resolution THG imaging technique based on backward-propagating THG. This super-resolution technique is experimentally demonstrated by imaging surface profiles with tens of nanometers resolution, which is the first time that such resolution is obtained in coherent nonlinear microscopy. Therefore, this imaging technique shows promise to become an important tool in high-resolution imaging of (biological) samples. The theoretical and numerical framework provides a foundation for future research on the origin of nonlinear microscopy signals. The new imaging techniques based on this framework have great potential in quantifying fibrillar structures and interfaces in biological samples.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Plasmonic Antennas and Arrays for Optical Imaging and Sensing Applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wang, Yan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The optics and photonics development is currently driven towards nanometer scales. However, diffraction imposes challenges for this development because it prevents confinement of light below a physical limit, commonly known as the diffraction limit. Several implications of the diffraction limit include that conventional optical microscopes are unable to resolve objects smaller than 250nm, and photonic circuits have a physical dimension on the order of the wavelength. Metals at optical frequencies display collective electron oscillations when excited by photon energy, giving rise to the surface plasmon modes with subdiffractional modal profile at metal-dielectric interfaces. Therefore, metallo-dielectric structures are promising candidates for alleviating the obstacles due to diffraction. This thesis investigates a particular branch of plasmonic structures, namely plasmonic antennas, for the purpose of optical imaging and sensing applications. Plasmonic antennas are known for their ability of dramatic near-field enhancement, as well as effective coupling of free-space radiation with localized energy. Such properties are demonstrated in this thesis through two particular applications. The first one is to utilize the interference of evanescent waves from an array of antennas to achieve near-field subdiffraction focusing, also known as superfocusing, in both one and two dimensions. Such designs could alleviate the tradeoffs in the current near-field scanning optical microscopy by improving the signal throughput and extending the imaging distance. The second application is to achieve more efficient radiation from single-emitters through coupling to a highly directive leaky-wave antenna. In this case, the leaky-wave antenna demonstrates the ability of enhancing the directivity over a very wide spectrum.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantum Control of Vibrational States in an Optical Lattice</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhuang, Chao</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, I present an experimental study of quantum control techniques for transferring population between vibrational states of atoms trapped in an optical lattice. Results from a range of techniques are compared, including techniques tested previously in the same system. In the study of the Adiabatic Rapid Passage (ARP) technique, control of population transfer is realized through varying the chirp rate and modulation amplitude of a frequency-chirped sinusoidal displacement of the lattice. Meanwhile, dependence of population transfer on the chirp direction is observed, which is explained by a model of ARP in a 3-level system. In the study of the coherent control technique, interference between a one-phonon transition at 2\omega and a two-phonon transition at omega is experimentally demonstrated. The omega and 2\omega transitions are realized by sinusoidally displacing the optical lattice at omega and sinusoidally modulating the lattice depth at 2\omega, respectively. The branching ratio of transitions to the first excited state and to higher excited states is controlled by varying the relative phase between these two pathways. The highest measured branching ratio of 17\pm2 is achieved among all the experiments using this coherent control scheme. In the study of the GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) technique, a "pulse" involving both displacement and depth-modulation of the lattice is used to transfer population. This pulse is theoretically engineered with the GRAPE algorithm to optimize the fidelity between the first excited state and the final state, when the lattice Hamiltonian without gravity for a specific lattice depth is considered. The experimental result shows that there is almost no excitation into higher excited states during population transfer from the ground to the first excited state, even when this process is affected by gravity and inhomogeneous broadening in reality. By comparing all the techniques, the GRAPE technique is found to be the best in terms of increasing population transfer into the first excited state while reducing excitation into higher excited states. On the other hand, the ARP technique creates the highest normalized population inversion, a ratio of the difference to the sum of the ground and the first excited state populations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Search for Heavy Resonances Decaying to Top Quark Pairs in the Boosted All-Hadronic Decay Channel</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Farooque, Trisha</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model predict the existence of TeV-scale resonances that decay to top quark pairs. This thesis presents a search for such resonances produced in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider with 4.7 fb−1 of data collected by the ATLAS detector in 2011. The search is performed in the channel where both top quarks decay hadronically and emerge in highly boosted states, and the collimated decay products of each boosted top quark are reconstructed as a single large jet (a “top quark jet”). A tagging technique based on the distinctive masses and substructures of these top quark jets is used to distinguish them from light quark and gluon jets. The data are found to be consistent with Standard Model predictions, and 95% credibility level upper limits are set on the cross section times branching ratio for leptophobic Z' bosons in a Topcolour model and Kaluza-Klein gluons as predicted by the bulk Randall-Sundrum model. These limits exclude Kaluza-Klein gluons with masses between 1.02 TeV and 1.62 TeV. The substructure of light quark and gluon jets, which form the dominant background to hadronically decaying boosted top quarks, is studied in an auxiliary measurement using 35 pb−1 of data collected by ATLAS during the 2010 run period. The observed substructure of these jets are found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Getting up to Speed: Understanding the Factors Associated with Post-stroke Gait Velocity</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jongsma, Adam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The factors that influence gait velocity post-stroke are not clearly understood. This thesis sought to uncover the factors associated with gait velocity, particularly those related to maximum velocity. The first of two studies investigated the associations between physical factors and preferred and maximum gait velocity. Analysis revealed that individuals with stroke were able to increase gait velocity from preferred and that this increase, along with the achieved velocity, were related to functional balance. The second study characterized the strategy individuals used to increase gait velocity, and compared between the stroke and healthy population. It also probed the relationships between cadence, step length, strategy, and post-stroke impairment. This study demonstrated that individuals with stroke rely more on cadence than step length to increase gait velocity. These results revealed the role of balance control on limiting gait velocity and the need for specific measures of impairment in research to direct clinical practice.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>High Frequency Shear Wave Imaging: A Feasibility Study In Tissue Mimicking Gelatin Phantoms</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Maeva, Anna</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Shear wave (SW) imaging is an ultrasound elastogrpahy technique for estimating the elastic properties of biological tissues. Increasing the frequency would improve both the confinement of the radiation force generating the shear wave, and the imaging spatial resolution. The objectives of the study were to realize a simple high frequency (HF) system for the generation and detection of SW propagation and to implement this system to develop and characterize tissue-mimicking gelatin phantoms (TMGP) for HF SWI with elastic properties in the range of those encountered in biological tissue. A 5 MHz and 10 MHz focused transducer were used to induced SW’s in TMGP ranging from 4% to 12% gelatin with 3% silica for scattering and a 25 MHz single-element focused transducer recorded pulse-echo signals in order to capture the SW. The shear wave speeds in the TMGP were found to range linearly from 1.59-4.59 m/s in the 4% to 12% gelatin samples.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Drag on a Cylinder in a Viscoelastic Stokes Flow</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Shiau, Terence Campbell</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis reports on measurements of drag on an unbounded cylinder in a viscoelastic Stokes flow, and compares these values with a Newtonian equivalent. Cylinders of diameter 0.5 to 3.34 mm were submerged 10 to 36 mm into slowly rotating annular tanks with channel widths between 133 to 152 mm. Theoretical formulas and computer simulations were used to correct for the effects of ends and walls, yielding estimates of the unbounded drag. The methodology was verified by testing Newtonian fluids and comparing the results to Kaplun’s (1957) prediction for unbounded drag. The test fluids used were a silicone oil, a polybutene, and two Boger fluids. By comparing the Boger fluid results to equally viscous Newtonian results, the contributions of elasticity to the drag were determined. The Deborah number (De) was used to represent the magnitude of flow elasticity, and an onset of elastic effects was measured between 0.5 and 0.7.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Subwavelength Imaging using Scanning Near-field Antenna Arrays</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Markley, Loic</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis examines a series of near-field antenna arrays used to perform subwavelength focusing and subwavelength imaging outside the extreme near field. For this purpose, slot and dipole arrays have been designed to produce a subwavelength focal spot at a distance of a quarter wavelength from the array. The dipole arrays are then used as scanning probes to produce images with subwavelength resolution based on perturbations in the scattered field. Unlike negative-refractive-index metamaterial superlenses, the imaging resolution is not affected by losses in the array. Furthermore, the arrays are simple to fabricate and are frequency scalable up to Terahertz frequencies and beyond. A near-field analogue to classic antenna-array theory called ``shifted beam theory'' is presented as a design tool. Based on the linear independence of element field patterns in the near field, this theory is very intuitive and provides a simplified way to calculate the element current weights necessary to generate a given target near-field pattern. Two-dimensional near-field subwavelength focusing is demonstrated using a slotted transmission-screen, or ``meta-screen'', under plane-wave incidence. At a distance of a quarter wavelength, the transverse electric field was measured in experiment to have a full-width half-maximum beamwidth of 0.40 by 0.27 wavelengths. This is compared to a single slot transmission-screen which had a beamwidth of 0.60 by 0.58 wavelengths. Broadside and end-fire dipole arrays are used to perform subwavelength imaging in one and two dimensions, respectively. The experimental minimum resolvable separation between two objects at a quarter-wavelength distance was 0.26 wavelengths using the end-fire array probe, as compared to 0.43 wavelengths for a single monopole probe. For an experiment using eight objects scattered over a one-square-wavelength area, however, the array probe imaging resolution remained around 0.25 wavelengths while the baseline monopole probe was no longer able to resolve any of the objects. Experiments were also conducted using objects buried behind a dielectric barrier as well as objects immersed within a dielectric. These results were consistent with the resolution improvements observed in the free-space resolution experiments.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fully Quadratic Vibronic Model of Electronic Transitions through Conical Intersections</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Endicott, Julia</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We introduce a perturbative method for studying photoinduced electronic transitions through conical intersections. Our approach uses a quadratic vibronic coupling Hamiltonian and second order cumulant approximation for the diabatic coupling to derive an analytical expression for time evolution of electronic populations at given temperatures. The formalism is an extension of a previous method called the non-equilibrium Fermi golden rule approach which used the linear vibronic coupling Hamiltonian with the same cumulant treatment for diabatic coupling. The advantage of the quadratic Hamiltonian is that it can include electronic states with different frequencies and normal modes. We explore these advantages with 2D models showing the improved accuracy of the new quadratic method over the linear method. We then apply our formalism to some real molecules, 2,6-bis(methylene) adamantyl cation, and its dimethyl derivative, with parameters obtained from electronic structure calculations followed by diabatization. The results show good agreement with quantum dynamics techniques.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Design of a Bioreactor to Mimic Hemodynamic Shear Stresses on Endothelial Cells in Microfluidic Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lightstone, Noam S.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The mechanisms behind cardiovascular disease (CVD) initiation and progression are not fully elucidated. It is hypothesized that blood flow patterns regulate endothelial cell (EC) function to affect the progression of CVDs. A system that subjects ECs to physiologically-relevant shear stress waveforms within microfluidic devices has not yet been demonstrated, despite the advantages associated with the use of these devices. In this work, a bioreactor was designed to fulfill this need. Waveforms from regions commonly affected by CVDs including were derived. Pump motion and fluid flow profiles were validated by actuator motion tracking, particle image velocimetry, and flowmeters. While several relevant waveforms were successfully replicated, physiological waveforms could not be produced at physiological frequencies owing to actuator velocity and accuracy limitations, as well as dampening effects in the system. Overall, this work lays the foundation for designing a system that provides insight into the role of shear stress in CVD pathogenesis.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>On the Solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation by the Method of Separation of Variables</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bruce, Aaron</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The method of separation of variables facilitates the integration of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation by reducing its solution to a series of quadratures in the separable coordinates. The case in which the metric tensor is diagonal in the separable coordinates, that is, orthogonal separability, is fundamental. Recent theory by Benenti has established a concise geometric (coordinate-independent) characterisation of orthogonal separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation on a pseudoRiemannian manifold. It generalises an approach initiated by Eisenhart and developed by Kalnins and Miller. Benenti has shown that the orthogonal separability of a system via a point transformation is equivalent to the existence of a Killing tensor with real simple eigen values and orthogonally integrable eigenvectors. Applying a moving frame formalism, we develop a method that produces the orthogonal separable coordinates for low dimensional Hamiltonian systems. The method is applied to a two dimensional Riemannian manifold of arbitrary curvature. As an illustration, we investigate Euclidean 2-space, and the two dimensional surfaces of constant curvature, recovering known results. Using our formalism, we also derive the known superseparable potentials for Euclidean 2-space. Some of the original results presented in this thesis were announced in [8, 9, 10].</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Contributions to the Study of the Validity of Huygens' Principle for the Non-self-adjoint Scalar Wave Equation on Petrov Type D Spacetimes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chu, Kenneth</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis makes contributions to the solution of Hadamard's problem through an examination of the question of the validity of Huygens'principle for the non-self-adjoint scalar wave equation on a Petrov type D spacetime. The problem is split into five further sub-cases based on the alignment of the Maxwell and Weyl principal spinors of the underlying spacetime. Two of these sub-cases are considered, one of which is proved to be incompatible with Huygens' principle, while for the other, it is shown that Huygens' principle implies that the two principal null congruences of the Weyl tensor are geodesic and shear-free. Furthermore, an unpublished result of McLenaghan regarding symmetric spacetimes of Petrov type D is independently verified. This result suggests the possible existence of counter-examples of the Carminati-McLenaghan conjecture.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The modeling of blood rheology in small vessels</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Scott, Matthew</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Blood is a dense suspension of flexible red blood cells. In response to a background flow, these cells distribute themselves non-uniformly throughout the vessel. As a result, material properties that are well defined in homogeneous fluids, such as viscosity, are no longer so, and depend upon the flow geometry along with the particle properties. Using a simple model that accounts for the steady-state particle distribution in vessel flow, we derive an expression for the effective viscosity of blood and the suspension flow velocity field in a pressure-driven tube flow.    We derive the steady-state particle distribution from a conservation equation with convective flux arising from particle deformation in the flow. We then relate the particle microstructure to the overall flow through a generalized Newtonian stress-tensor, with the particle volume fraction appearing in the expression for the local viscosity. Comparing with experimental data, we show that the model quantitatively reproduces the observed rheology of blood in tube flow.    We reconsider the problem in an alternate geometry corresponding to the flow between two concentric cylinders. The steady-state particle distribution, suspension velocity field and the measured effective viscosity are all very different from their counterparts in tube flow, casting serious doubt upon the practice of using data from a Couette viscometer to parameterize constitutive models applied to vascular blood flow.    Finally, we calculate the effect of random fluctuations in the particle velocity on the averaged behaviour of the particle conservation equation. Using a smoothing method for linear stochastic differential equations, we derive a correction to the free Einstein-Stokes diffusion coeffcient that is due to the interaction of the particles with their neighbours.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Physically-based Simulation of Tornadoes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ding, Xiangyang</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this physically-based tornado simulation, the tornado-scale approach techniques are applied to simulate the tornado formation environment. The three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible viscous fluid flows are used to model the tornado dynamics. The boundary conditions applied in this simulation lead to rotating and uplifting flow movement as found in real tornadoes and tornado research literatures. Moreover, a particle system is incorporated with the model equation solutions to model the irregular tornado shapes. Also, together with appropriate boundary conditions, varied particle control schemes produce tornadoes with different shapes. Furthermore, a modified metaball scheme is used to smooth the density distribution. Texture mapping, antialising, animation and volume rendering are applied to produce realistic visual results. The rendering algorithm is implemented in OpenGL.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Starodubtsev, Artem</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The main technical problem with background independent approaches to quantum gravity is inapplicability of standard quantum field theory methods. New methods are needed which would be adapted to the basic principles of General Relativity. Topological field theory is a model which provides natural tools for background independent quantum gravity. It is exactly soluble and, at the same time, diffeomorphism invariant. Applications of topological field theory to quantum gravity include description of boundary states of quantum General Relativity, formulation of quantum gravity as a constrained topological field theory, and a new perturbation theory which uses topological field theory as a starting point. The later is the central theme of the thesis. Unlike the traditional perturbation theory it does not require splitting metric into a background and fluctuations, it is exactly diffeomorphism invariant order by order, and the coupling constant of this theory is dimensionless. We describe the basic ideas and techniques of this perturbation theory as well as inclusion of matter particles, boundary states, and other necessary tools for studying scattering problem in background independent quantum gravity.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Monte Carlo Study of the Magnetic Flux Lattice Fluctuations in High- T c   Superconductors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Beny, Cedric</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>By allowing to measure the magnetic field distribution inside a material, muon spin rotation experiments have the potential to provide valuable information about microscopic properties of high-temperature superconductors. Nevertheless, information about the intrinsic superconducting properties of the material is masked by random thermal and static fluctuations of the magnetic field which penetrates the material in the form of vortices of quantized magnetic flux. A good understanding of the fluctuations of those vortices is needed for the correct determination of intrinsic properties, notably the coherence length ξ, and the field penetration depth λ. We develop a simulation based on the Metropolis algorithm in order to understand the effect, on the magnetic field distribution, of disorder- and thermally-induced fluctuations of the vortex lattice inside a layered superconductor.    Our model correctly predicts the melting temperatures of the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6. 95  (YBCO) superconductor but largely underestimates the observed entropy jump. Also we failed to simulate the high field disordered phase, possibly because of a finite size limitation. In addition, we found our model unable to describe the first-order transition observed in the highly anisotropic Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ y  .    Our model predicts that for YBCO, the effect of thermal fluctuations on the field distribution is indistinguishable from a change in ξ. It also confirms the usual assumption that the effect of static fluctuations at low temperature can be efficiently modeled by convolution of the field distribution with a Gaussian function. However the extraction of ξ at low fields requires a very high resolution of the field distribution because of the low vortex density.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Quasilocal Hamiltonian for Gravity with Classical and Quantum Applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Booth, Ivan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>I modify the quasilocal energy formalism of Brown and York into a purely Hamiltonian form. As part of the reformulation, I remove their restriction that the time evolution of the boundary of the spacetime be orthogonal to the leaves of the time foliation. Thus the new formulation allows an arbitrary evolution of the boundary which physically corresponds to allowing general motions of the set of observers making up that boundary. I calculate the rate of change of the quasilocal energy in such situations, show how it transforms with respect to boosts of the boundaries, and use the Lanczos-Israel thin shell formalism to reformulate it from an operational point of view. These steps are performed both for pure gravity and gravity with attendant matter fields. I then apply the formalism to characterize naked black holes and study their properties, investigate gravitational tidal heating, and combine it with the path integral formulation of quantum gravity to analyze the creation of pairs of charged and rotating black holes. I show that one must use complex instantons to study this process though the probabilities of creation remain real and consistent with the view that the entropy of a black hole is the logarithm of the number of its quantum states.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Field-Free Alignment and Strong Field Control of Molecular Rotors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Spanner, Michael</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Methods of controlling molecular rotations using linearly polarized femtosecond and picosecond pulses are considered and analyzed theoretically. These laser pulses, typically in the infrared, are highly non-resonant with respect to the electronic degrees of freedom of the molecules and have intensities of ∼ 10^13 to 10^14 W/cm&amp;sup2;. It is shown how these laser pulses can force small linear molecules to align with the direction of the electric field vector of the laser both in the presence of the laser field as well as after the application of a short laser pulse. Recent experiments on laser-induced molecular alignment are modeled and excellent agreement between experiment and theory is found. Additional methods of controlling molecular rotational dynamics are outlined. The first method considers the forced rotational acceleration of diatomic molecules, called the  optical centrifuge . Here, the direction of polarization of a linearly polarized laser field is made to smoothly rotate faster and faster. The molecules, which tend to align with the polarization vector of the laser field, follow the rotation of the laser polarization and are accelerated to high angular momentum. The second method considers the control of field-free rotational dynamics by applying phase shifts to the molecular wave function at select times called  fractional revivals . At these select moments, an initially localized wave function splits into several copies of the initial state. Adding phase shifts to the copies then induces interference effects which can be used to control the subsequent evolution of the rotational wave function. This same control scheme has a close link to quantum information and this connection is outlined. Finally, a recently proposed method of controlling the quantum dynamics of the classically chaotic kicked rotor system [J. Gong and P. Brumer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 1741 (2001)] is analyzed from a phase space perspective. It is shown that the proposed quantum control can be linked to small islands of stability in the classical phase space. An experimentally feasible variant of this control scenario using wave packets of molecular alignment is proposed. Two applications of molecular alignment are discussed. The first application uses field-free aligned molecules as a non-linear medium for compression of a laser pulse to the 1 fs regime at optical wavelengths. At such durations, these laser pulses contain nearly a single oscillation of the electric field and represent the shortest laser pulses physically achievable for such frequencies. The second application uses molecular alignment to create a sort of gas phase "molecular crystal" which forms a basis for laser-induced electron diffraction and imaging of the aligned molecules. Here, a first laser pulse aligns the molecules in space. A second laser pulse is then used to ionize outer-shell electrons, accelerate them in the laser field, and steer them back to collide with the parent ion creating a diffraction image with sub-femtosecond and sub-Angstrom resolution.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Modelling Quantum Well Lasers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Weetman, Philip</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, two methods to model quantum well lasers will be examined. The first model is based on well-known techniques to determine some of the spectral and dynamical properties of the laser. For the spectral properties, an expression for TE and TM modal amplitude gain is derived. For the dynamical properties, the rate equations are shown. The spectral and dynamical properties can be examined separately for specific operating characteristics or used in conjunction with each other for a complete description of the laser. Examples will be shown to demonstrate some of the analysis and results that can be obtained. The second model used is based on Wigner functions and the quantum Boltzmann equation. It is derived from general non-equilibrium Greens functions with the application of the Kadanoff-Baym ansatz. This model is less phenomenological than the previous model and does not require the separation of physical processes such as the former spectral and dynamical properties. It therefore has improved predictive power for the performance of novel laser designs. To the Author's knowledge, this is the first time such a model has been formulated. The quantum Boltzmann equations will be derived and some calculations will be performed for a simplified system in order to illustrate some calculation techniques as well as results that can be obtained.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Taub-NUT Spacetime in the (A)dS/CFT and M-Theory</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Clarkson, Richard</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the following thesis, I will conduct a thermodynamic analysis of the Taub-NUT spacetime in various dimensions, as well as show uses for Taub-NUT and other Hyper-Kahler spacetimes.    Thermodynamic analysis (by which I mean the calculation of the entropy and other thermodynamic quantities, and the analysis of these quantities) has in the past been done by use of background subtraction. The recent derivation of the (A)dS/CFT correspondences from String theory has allowed for easier and quicker analysis. I will use Taub-NUT space as a template to test these correspondences against the standard thermodynamic calculations (via the Nöether method), with (in the Taub-NUT-dS case especially) some very interesting results.    There is also interest in obtaining metrics in eleven dimensions that can be reduced down to ten dimensional string theory metrics. Taub-NUT and other Hyper-Kahler metrics already possess the form to easily facilitate the Kaluza-Klein reduction, and embedding such metrics into eleven dimensional metrics containing M2 or M5 branes produces metrics with interesting Dp-brane results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Physics in Higher-Dimensional Manifolds</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Seahra, Sanjeev</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, we study various aspects of physics in higher-dimensional manifolds involving a single extra dimension. After giving some historical perspective on the motivation for studying higher-dimensional theories of physics, we describe classical tests for a non-compact extra dimension utilizing test particles and pointlike gyroscopes. We then turn our attention to the problem of embedding any given  n -dimensional spacetime within an ( n +1)-dimensional manifold, paying special attention to how any structure from the extra dimension modifies the standard  n -dimensional Einstein equations. Using results derived from this investigation and the formalism derived for test particles and gyroscopes, we systematically introduce three specific higher-dimensional models and classify their properties; including the Space-Time-Matter and two types of braneworld models. The remainder of the thesis concentrates on specific higher-dimensional cosmological models drawn from the above mentioned scenarios; including an analysis of the embedding of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker submanifolds in 5-dimensional Minkowski and topological Schwarzschild spaces, and an investigation of the dynamics of a  d -brane that takes the form of a thin shell encircling a ( d +2)-dimensional topological black hole in anti-deSitter space. The latter is derived from a finite-dimensional action principle, which allows us to consider the canonical quantization of the model and the solutions of the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt equation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Mass Transfer to/from Distributed Sinks/Sources in Porous Media</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhao, Weishu</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This research addresses a number of fundamental issues concerning convective mass transfer across fluid-fluid interfaces in porous media. Mass transfer to/from distributed sinks/sources is considered for i) the slow dissolution of liquid filaments of a wetting non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) held in the corners of angular pores or throats and ii) the fate of gas bubbles generated during the flow of a supersaturated aqueous phase in porous media. 1. Effects of the stability of NAPL films on wetting NAPL dissolution Wettability profoundly affects the distribution of residual NAPL contaminants in natural soils. Under conditions of preferential NAPL wettability, NAPL is retained within small pores and in the form of thick films (liquid filaments) along the corners and crevices of the pore walls. NAPL films in pore corners provide capillary continuity between NAPL-filled pores, dramatically influencing the behaviour of NAPL dissolution to the flowing aqueous phase by convection and diffusion. A pore network model is developed to explore the dissolution behaviour of wetting NAPL in porous media. The effects of initial NAPL distribution and NAPL film stability on dissolution behaviour are studied using the simulator. NAPL phase loses continuity and splits into disconnected clusters of NAPL-filled pores due to rupture of NAPL films. Quasi-state drainage and fingering of the aqueous phase into NAPL-filled pores is treated as an invasion percolation process and a stepwise procedure is adopted for the solution of flow and solute concentration fields. NAPL film stability is shown to critically affect the rate of mass transfer as such that stable NAPL films provide for more rapid dissolution. The network simulator reproduces the essential physics of wetting NAPL dissolution in porous media and explains the concentration-tailing behaviour observed in experiments, suggesting also new possibilities for experimental investigation. 2. Convective Mass Transfer across Fluid Interfaces in Straight Angular Pores Steady convective mass transfer to or from fluid interfaces in pores of angular cross-section is theoretically investigated. The model incorporates the essential physics of capillarity and solute mass transfer by convection and diffusion in corner fluid filaments. The geometry of the corner filaments, characterized by the fluid-fluid contact angle, the corner half-angle and the interface meniscus curvature, is accounted for. Boundary conditions of zero surface shear (???perfect-slip???) and infinite surface shear (???no-slip???) at the fluid-fluid interface are considered. The governing equations for laminar flow within the corner filament and convective diffusion to or from the fluid-fluid interface are solved using finite-element methods. Flow computations are verified by comparing the dimensionless resistance factor and hydraulic conductance of corner filaments against recent numerical solutions by Patzek and Kristensen [2001]. Novel results are obtained for the average effluent concentration as a function of flow geometry and pore-scale Peclet number. These results are correlated to a characteristic corner length and local pore-scale Peclet number using empirical equations appropriate for implementation in pore network models. Finally, a previously published ???2D-slit??? approximation to the problem at hand is checked and found to be in considerable error. 3. Bubble evolution driven by solute diffusion during the process of supersaturated carbonated water flooding In situ bubble growth in porous media is simulated using a pore network model that idealizes the pore space as a lattice of cubic chambers connected by square tubes. Evolution of the gas phase from nucleation sites is driven by the solute mass transfer from the flowing supersaturated water solution to the bubble clusters. Effects of viscous aqueous phase flow and convective diffusion in pore corners are explicitly accounted for. Growth of bubble clusters is characterised by a pattern of quasi-static drainage and fingering in the gas phase, an invasion percolation process controlled by capillary and gravitational forces. A stepwise solution procedure is followed to determine the aqueous flow field and the solute concentration field in the model by solving the conservation equations. Mobilization of bubbles driven by buoyancy forces is also studied. Results of bubble growth pattern, relative permeability and macroscopic mass transfer coefficient are obtained under different gas saturations and aqueous flow conditions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fiber Birefringence Modeling for Polarization Mode Dispersion</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Huang, Weihong</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis concerns polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fiber communications. Specifically, we study fiber birefringence, PMD stochastic properties, PMD mitigation and the interaction of fiber birefringence and fiber nonlinearity. Fiber birefringence is the physical origin of polarization mode dispersion. Current models of birefringence in optical fibers assume that the birefringence vector varies randomly either in orientation with a fixed magnitude or simultaneously in both magnitude and direction. These models are applicable only to certain birefringence profiles. For a broader range of birefringence profiles, we propose and investigate four general models in which the stochastically varying amplitude is restricted to a limited range. In addition, mathematical algorithms are introduced for the numerical implementation of these models. To investigate polarization mode dispersion, we first apply these models to single mode fibers. In particular, two existing models and our four more general models are employed for the evolution of optical fiber birefringence with longitudinal distance to analyze, both theoretically and numerically, the behavior of the polarization mode dispersion. We find that while the probability distribution function of the differential group delay (DGD) varies along the fiber length as in existing models, the dependence of the mean DGD on fiber length differs noticeably from earlier predictions. Fiber spinning reduces polarization mode dispersion effects in optical fibers. Since relatively few studies have been performed of the dependence of the reduction factor on the strength of random background birefringence fluctuations, we here apply a general birefringence model to sinusoidal spun fibers. We find that while, as expected, the phase matching condition is not affected by random perturbations, the degree of PMD reduction as well as the probability distribution function of the DGD are both influenced by the random components of the birefringence. Together with other researchers, I have also examined a series of experimentally realizable procedures to compensate for PMD in optical fiber systems. This work demonstrates that a symmetric ordering of compensator elements combined with Taylor and Chebyshev approximations to the transfer matrix for the light polarization in optical fibers can significantly widen the compensation bandwidth. In the last part of the thesis, we applied the Manakov-PMD equation and a general model of fiber birefringence to investigate pulse distortion induced by the interaction of fiber birefringence and fiber nonlinearity. We find that the effect of nonlinearity on the pulse distortion differs markedly with the birefringence profile.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Modeling and Simulation of Polarization Mode Dispersion and Polarization Dependent Loss</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Reimer, Michael</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Novel theoretical formulations and efficient simulation methods for polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) and polarization-dependent loss (PDL) that are directly applicable to optical network design are developed. In particular, a formalism based upon the Magnus expansion is advanced for the determination of the frequency evolution of the Mueller matrix in terms of increasing orders of PMD and PDL. Several previous models of polarization evolution are shown to be specializations of this more general formalism. A least-squares algorithm that extracts PMD and PDL coefficients from repeated measurements of the output Stokes vector of an optical system for a random set of input polarization states is introduced and subsequently applied to the rapid experimental determination of the probability density of the differential group delay of a fiber-squeezer based PMD emulator. The applicability of Clifford algebra and Pade-approximant techniques to the efficient simulation of the wavelength dependence of PMD and PDL is also discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Stability and Boundedness of Impulsive Systems with Time Delay</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wang, Qing</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The stability and boundedness theories are developed for impulsive differential equations with time delay. Definitions, notations and fundamental theory are presented for delay differential systems with both fixed and state-dependent impulses. It is usually more difficult to investigate the qualitative properties of systems with state-dependent impulses since different solutions have different moments of impulses. In this thesis, the stability problems of nontrivial solutions of systems with state-dependent impulses are ``transferred" to those of the trivial solution of systems with fixed impulses by constructing the so-called ``reduced system". Therefore, it is enough to investigate the stability problems of systems with fixed impulses. The exponential stability problem is then discussed for the system with fixed impulses. A variety of stability criteria are obtained and`numerical examples are worked out to illustrate the results, which shows that impulses do contribute to the stabilization of some delay differential equations. To unify various stability concepts and to offer a general framework for the investigation of stability theory, the concept of stability in terms of two measures is introduced and then several stability criteria are developed for impulsive delay differential equations by both the single and multiple Lyapunov functions method. Furthermore, boundedness and periodicity results are discussed for impulsive differential systems with time delay. The Lyapunov-Razumikhin technique, the Lyapunov functional method, differential inequalities, the method of variation of parameters, and the partitioned matrix method are the main tools to obtain these results. Finally, the application of the stability theory to neural networks is presented. In applications, the impulses are considered as either means of impulsive control or perturbations.Sufficient conditions for stability and stabilization of neural networks are obtained.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>On the Application of Photoacoustic Absorption Spectral Data to the Modeling of Leaf Optical Properties</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Eng, Denise</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Due to the importance of plants in the Earth's ecosystem, their photobiological responses have become the subject of extensive research in life sciences. Leaf optical models have been developed to assist in the analysis of remotely sensed data to derive information on leaf biochemistry and anatomy from foliar spectral curves (transmittance and reflectance). In this paper, we investigate the implications of using in vitro pigment absorption spectra to model foliar optical properties in the visible domain. Typically pigment absorption spectra have been determined using light absorption spectroscopy or by applying a data fitting approach. Alternatively, we propose the use of photoacoustic absorption spectroscopy, which despite being available in the literature has not been used in the modeling of foliar optical properties before. We also perform computational experiments in which foliar modeled reflectance and transmittance spectral curves generated using these different absorption data sets are compared with actual measured data. Our findings indicate that the proposed alternative not only allows key pigments to be individually incorporated into the models, which, in turn, increases the predictability of the simulations, but also enables the generation of modeled leaf spectra that are closer approximations to measured leaf spectra than those obtained using absorption data derived from standard absorption spectroscopy procedures.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Norris, Ryan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents the design of a two-dimensional phononic band gap crystal simulator, and phononic crystal analysis.    Phononic crystals and their application to microwave acoustic filters are studied. Wave mechanics is introduced. A two-dimensional phononic crystal simulator is developed. Simulator operation is validated through comparison with published data. Design parameters for phononic crystal band gap engineering are outlined. Digital signal processing and wave mechanics are utilized to analyze fractal and circular inclusion based phononic crystals. Topics for further study are given.    Phononic crystal band structure is found to be sensitive to inclusion boundary geometry. Fractal inclusion based crystals provide multiple pass band characteristics. The evolution of a fractal inclusion in a phononic crystal may cause band gap widening and the formation of new band gaps. Circular inclusion based phononic crystals have piecewise-linear phase characteristics and quality factors up to 600.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Fast Hybrid Method for Analysis and Design of Photonic Structures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rohani, Arash</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents a very efficient hybrid method for analysis and design of optical and passive photonic devices. The main focus is on unbounded wave structures. This class of photonic systems are in general very large in terms of the wavelength of the driving optical sources. The size of the problem space makes the electromagnetic modelling of these structure a very challenging problem. Our approach and main contribution has been to combine or hybridize three methods that together can handle this class of photonic structures as a whole.    The basis of the hybrid method is a novel Gaussian Beam Tracing method GBT. Gaussian Beams (GB) are very suitable elementary functions for tracing and tracking purposes due to their finite extent and the fact that they are good approximations for actual laser beams. The GBT presented in this thesis is based on the principle of phase matching. This method can be used to model the reflection and refraction of Gaussian beams from general curved surfaces as long as the curvature of the surface is relatively small. It can also model wave propagation in free space. The developed GBT is extremely fast as it essentially uses simple algebraic equations to find the parameters of the reflected and refracted beams once the parameters of the incident beam is known. Therefore sections of the systems whose dimensions are large relative to the optical wavelength are simulated by the GBT method.    Fields entering a photonic system may not possess an exact Gaussian profile. For example if an aperture limits the input laser to the system, the field is no longer a GB. In these and other similar cases the field at some aperture plane needs to be expanded into a sum of GBs. Gabor expansion has been used for this purpose. This method allows any form of field distribution on a flat or curved surface to be expanded into a sum of GBs. The resultant GBs are then launched inside the system and tracked by GBT. Calculation of the coefficients of the Gabor series is very fast (1-2 minutes on a typical computer for most applications).    In some cases the dimensions or physical properties of structures do not allow the application of the GBT method. For example if the curvature of a surface is very large (or its radius of curvature is very small) or if the surface contains sharp edges or sub-wavelength dimensions GBT is no longer valid. In these cases we have utilized the Finite Difference Time Domain method (FDTD). FDTD is a rigorous and very accurate full wave electromagnetic solver. The time domain form of Maxwell's equations are discretized and solved. No matrix inversion is needed for this method. If the size of the structure that needs to be analyzed is large relative to the wavelength FDTD can become increasingly time consuming. Nevertheless once a structure is simulated using FDTD for a given input, the output is expanded using Gabor expansion and the resultant beams can then be efficiently propagated through any desired system using GBT. For example if a diffraction grating is illuminated by some source, once the reflection is found using FDTD, it can be propagated very efficiently through any kind of lens or prism (or other optical structures) using GBT. Therefore the overall computational efficiency of the hybrid method is very high compared to other methods.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Boundary Integral Equation Method in Elasticity with Microstructure</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Shmoylova, Elena</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Problems involving mechanical behavior of materials with microstructure are receiving an increasing amount of attention in the literature. First of all, it can be attributed to the fact that a number of recent experiments shows a significant discrepancy between results of the classical theory of elasticity and the actual behavior of materials for which microstructure is known to be significant (e. g. synthetic polymers, human bones). Second, materials, for which microstructure contributes significantly in the overall deformation of a whole body, are becoming more and more important for applications in different areas of modern day mechanics, physics and engineering.    Since the classical theory is not adequate for modeling the elastic behavior of such materials, a new theory, which allows us to incorporate microstructure into a classical model, should be used.    The foundations of a theory allowing to account for the effect of material microstructure were developed in the beginning of the twentieth century and is known as the theory of Cosserat (micropolar, asymmetric) elasticity. For the last forty years significant results have been accomplished leading to a better understanding of processes occurring in Cosserat continuum. In particular, significant progress has been achieved in the investigation of three-dimensional problems of micropolar elasticity, plane and anti-plane problems, bending of micropolar plates. These problems can be effectively solved in a very elegant manner using the boundary integral equation method.    However, the boundary integral equation method imposes significant restrictions on properties of boundaries of domains under consideration. In particular, it requires that the boundary be represented by a twice differentiable curve which makes it impossible to apply the method for domains with reduced boundary smoothness or domains containing cuts or cracks. Therefore, the rigorous treatment of boundary value problems of Cosserat elasticity for domains with irregular boundaries has remained untouched until today.    A mathematically sophisticated, but very effective approach which allows to overcome the difficulty relating to the boundary requirement consists of the formulation of the corresponding boundary value problems in terms of the distributional setting in Sobolev spaces. In this case the appropriate weak solution may be found in terms of the corresponding integral potentials which perfectly works for domains with reduced boundary smoothness.    The objective of this work is to develop such a method that allows us to describe and solve the boundary value problems of plane Cosserat elasticity for domains with non-smooth boundaries and for domains weakened by cracks. We illustrate the method by establishing the analytical solutions for boundary value problems of plane Cosserat elasticity, which plays an important role as a pilot problem for the investigation of more challenging problems of three-dimensional theory of micropolar elasticity. We show that the analytical solutions derived in this work may be successfully approximated numerically using the boundary element method and that these solutions can be extremely important for applications in engineering science.    One of the important applied problems considered herein is the problem of stress distribution around a crack in a human bone. The bone is modeled under assumptions of plane Cosserat elasticity and the solution derived on the basis of the method developed in this dissertation shows that material microstructure does indeed have a significant effect on stress distribution around a crack.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Towards Large Eddy Simulation of Boundary Layer Flows at High Reynolds Number: Statistical Modeling of the Inner Layer</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Larsson, Johan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Most fluid flows of practical interest involve and are affected by turbulence. One of the most promising computational methods for the prediction of turbulent flows is the so-called large eddy simulation (LES) methodology. Experience over the past decades have shown the capability of LES to provide accurate predictions for several types of flow at a reasonable computational cost. It has also become clear, however, that the LES methodology fails when applied to boundary layer flows at high Reynolds numbers. Since many engineering applications fall in exactly that category, this failure is often considered the most severe bottleneck of LES.    The present thesis is an attempt to move towards a solution of this problem. Inspired by the idealized picture of a turbulent boundary layer, a statistical model is used for the approximately universal turbulence in the inner boundary layer, whereas the more flow dependent outer boundary layer is solved by LES. Ideally, this results in a computational method that provides accurate predictions of rather general turbulent flows, while maintaining a tractable computational cost. In practice, the results are a vast improvement compared to LES without any inner layer modeling, but a transition layer appears where the state of the turbulence changes from being modeled statistically to resolved by LES. This so-called 'artificial buffer layer' results in the skin friction being consistently underpredicted by 10-15%.    The physics and dynamics of this artificial buffer layer are investigated and characterized, and it is argued that there exist several similarities with true buffer layer turbulence. Additional forcing of the momentum equations is used as a means to trigger resolved turbulence motions more quickly, and it is demonstrated that the results are better: the artificial buffer layer is smaller, the skin friction is accurately predicted, and the dynamics in the inner layer have more correct length scales. The results with the additional forcing are very sensitive to the forcing amplitude, and a simple control algorithm for this parameter is proposed and tested with favourable results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hydrodynamic Stability of Free Convection from an Inclined Elliptic Cylinder</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Finlay, Leslie</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The steady problem of free convective heat transfer from an isothermal inclined elliptic cylinder and its stability is investigated. The cylinder is inclined at an arbitrary angle with the horizontal and immersed in an unbounded, viscous, incompressible fluid. It is assumed that the flow is laminar and two-dimensional and that the Boussinesq approximation is valid. The full steady Navier-Stokes and thermal energy equations are transformed to elliptical co-ordinates and an asymptotic analysis is used to find appropriate far-field conditions. A numerical scheme based on finite differences is then used to obtain numerical solutions. Results are found for small to moderate Grashof and Prandtl numbers, and varying ellipse inclinations and aspect ratios.    A linear stability analysis is performed to determine the critical Grashof number at which the flow loses stability. Comparisons are made with long-time unsteady solutions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Consolidation and wave propagation in a porous medium</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gerasik, Vladimir</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Basic diffusion analytical solutions of one-dimensional consolidation are presented for the case of a semi-infinite domain. Typical tractions considered include instantaneous loads of the medium with a free boundary pressure, as well as the case of a permeable membrane located at the forced boundary.    Two-dimensional boundary value problems for a porous half-space, described by the widely recognized Biot's equations of poroelasticity, including inertia effects is discussed. In this poroelastic version of Lamb's problem in the classical theory of linear elastic waves, the surface of a porous half-space is subjected to a prescribed line traction. The following two broadly applicable cases are considered: 1) A steady state harmonic load, 2) An impulsive load (Dirac delta function time dependence). A general analytical solution of the problem in the Fourier -- Laplace space was obtained by the application of the standard Helmholtz potential decomposition, which reduces the problem to a system of wave equations for three unknown potentials, which correspond to three types of motion: P1, slow P2 wave, and the shear wave S. The possibilities of, and procedure for, obtaining analytic solutions in the physical space subsequently are discussed in detail. When viscous dissipation effects are taken into account, a steady-state harmonic line traction solution can be represented in the form of well convergent integrals, while for the case when viscous dissipation is ignored, closed form analytic solutions can be obtained for impulsive forcing with the application of the Cagniard -- de Hoop inversion technique. Numerical studies of the dispersion relation of the Rayleigh, or surface, wave for cases in which the dissipation is not negligible are presented.</dc:description>

Specifically, in four dimensions we construct new families of axisymmetric vacuum solutions using a solution-generating technique based on the hidden  SL (2,R) symmetry of the effective action. In particular, using the Schwarzschild solution as a seed we obtain the Zipoy-Voorhees generalisation of the Taub-NUT solution and of the Eguchi-Hanson soliton. Using the  C -metric as a seed, we obtain and study the accelerating versions of all the above solutions. In higher dimensions we present new classes of NUT-charged spaces, generalizing the previously known even-dimensional solutions to odd and even dimensions, as well as to spaces with multiple NUT-parameters. We also find the most general form of the odd-dimensional Eguchi-Hanson solitons. We use such solutions to investigate the thermodynamic properties of NUT-charged spaces in (A)dS backgrounds. These have been shown to yield counter-examples to some of the conjectures advanced in the still elusive dS/CFT paradigm (such as the maximal mass conjecture and Bousso's entropic N-bound). One important application of NUT-charged spaces is to construct higher dimensional generalizations of Kaluza-Klein magnetic monopoles, generalizing the known 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein soliton. Another interesting application involves a study of time-dependent higher-dimensional bubbles-of-nothing generated from NUT-charged solutions. We use them to test the AdS/CFT conjecture as well as to generate, by using stringy Hopf-dualities, new interesting time-dependent solutions in string theory. Finally, we construct and study new NUT-charged solutions in higher-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theories, generalizing the known Reissner-Nordström solutions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Multifrequency Raman Generation in the Transient Regime</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Turner, Fraser</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Two colour pumping was used to investigate the short-pulse technique of Multifrequency Raman Generation (MRG) in the transient regime of Raman scattering. In the course of this study we have demonstrated the ability to generate over thirty Raman orders spanning from the infrared to the ultraviolet, investigated the dependence of this generation on the pump intensities and the dispersion characteristics of the hollow-fibre system in which the experiment was conducted, and developed a simple computer model to help understand the exhibited behaviours. These dependence studies have revealed some characteristics that have been previously mentioned in the literature, such as the competition between MRG and self-phase modulation, but have also demonstrated behaviours that are dramatically different than anything reported on the subject. Furthermore, through a simple modification of the experimental apparatus we have demonstrated the ability to scatter a probe pulse into many Raman orders, generating bandwidth comparable to the best pump-probe experiments of MRG. By using a numeric fast Fourier transform, we predict that our spectra can generate pulses as short as 3. 3fs, with energies an order of magnitude larger than pulses of comparable duration that are made using current techniques.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Instabilities in Higher-Dimensional Theories of Gravity</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hovdebo, Jordan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A number of models of nature incorporate dimensions beyond our observed four. In this thesis we examine some examples and consequences of classical instabilities that emerge in the higher-dimensional theories of gravity which can describe their low energy phenomenology.    We first investigate a gravitational instability for black strings carrying momentum along an internal direction. We argue that this implies a new type of solution that is nonuniform along the extra dimension and find that there is a boost dependent critical dimension for which they are stable. Our analysis implies the existence of an analogous instability for the five-dimensional black ring. We construct a simple mode of the black ring to aid in applying these results and argue that such rings should exist in any number of space-time dimensions.    Next we consider a recently constructed class of nonsupersummetric solutions of type IIB supergravity which are everywhere smooth and have no horizon. We demonstrate that these solutions are all classically unstable. The instability is a generic feature of horizonless geometries with an ergoregion. We consider the endpoint of this instability and argue that the solutions decay to supersymmetric configurations. We also comment on the implications of the ergoregion instability for Mathur's 'fuzzball' proposal.    Finally, we consider an interesting braneworld cosmology in the Randall-Sundrum scenario constructed using a bulk space-time which corresponds to a charged AdS black hole. In particular, these solutions appear to 'bounce', making a smooth transition from a contracting to an expanding phase. By considering the space-time geometry more carefully, we demonstrate that generically in these solutions the brane will encounter a singularity in the transition region.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Device for Measuring Groundwater Velocity in the Capillary Fringe</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Berg, Steven James</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Groundwater flow in the capillary fringe is rarely measured during hydrogeological studies because of the difficulties associated with investigating this region. Previous research using a point velocity probe (PVP) to investigate groundwater velocity below the water table suggested that the PVP may also be capable of measuring groundwater velocity within the capillary fringe. The earlier PVP was redesigned for this study to allow for groundwater velocity data to be collected remotely. Using this system, groundwater velocity in the capillary fringe was investigated under field and laboratory conditions. Field experiments to investigate horizontal flow in the capillary fringe were conducted either by collecting vertical velocity profiles across the water table, or by holding the probe stationary and allowing seasonal recharge to move the capillary fringe and water table past the probe. Laboratory experiments were conducted in a controlled flow tank that simulated regions of an aquifer up to 85 cm above the water table. The redesigned PVP performed well as a remote system and provided velocity measurements up to 12 cm above the water table under field conditions. These values were consistent with those measured below the water table. In the laboratory, under conditions of drainage, groundwater velocity measurements in the capillary fringe consistent with values below the water table were measured up to 44 cm above the water table. The ability to measure horizontal flow of groundwater in the capillary fringe may open up new avenues for research in the study of contaminant transport in phreatic aquifers.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>New Route to Frustration by Quantum Many-Body Effects in the Spin Liquid Pyrochlore Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Molavian Jazi, Hamidreza</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis we investigate the frustrated spin liquid Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ theoretically. The low-energy effective Hamiltonian of this compound is derived by integrating out the excited crystal field states. It is shown that the pairwise interaction in the effective Hamiltonian is renormalized by all the other Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ ions in the system and dynamically generate frustration. The phase diagram of Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ in the single tetrahedron approximation is calculated. It is shown that Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ is in a singlet state which is a linear combination of all frustrated two-in/two-out states. Motivated by experimental results, the diffuse neutron scattering of Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ is obtained within the single tetrahedron approximation. This diffuse neutron scattering captures semi-quantitatively most of the experimental neutron scattering features. The magnetization of Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ in the single tetrahedron approximation is calculated. Two experiments based on diffuse neutron scattering and magnetization in high symmetry directions are proposed to verify the spin ice like ground state of Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental Investigation of the Flow Behaviour Inside a Centrifugal Impeller Channel at Design and Off-Design Flow Rates</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Altaf, Ammar</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>An experimental study of the flow behavior inside the channels of an 8-blade backswept low specific speed impeller at design and off-design conditions is presented. The measurements took place at both the inlet and the outlet of the impeller channel at the mid height of the channel passage. The particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique was used to measure the velocity components in the inlet and outlet frames of the impeller channel. The flow behavior inside the channel, the mean normalized primary and secondary velocity components at six radial locations inside the channels, and turbulence intensity in terms of the variation in the relative velocity components were investigated at the design condition, 75%, 50%, 40%, 30% and 25% of the design flow rate. The results demonstrated a well behaved flow with no evidence of flow separation at the design condition. The fluid flow inside the impeller channel started experiencing a flow separation, when the flow rate is reduced, which propagated throughout the channel passage and caused the channel to stall with a large recirculation zone at severe off-design flow rates.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Spectral analysis of internal waves generated by tide-topography interaction</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Korobov, Alexander</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Internal waves in the deep ocean play a deciding role in processes such as climate change and nutrient cycles. Winds and tidal currents over topography feed energy into internal waves at large scales; through nonlinear interaction the energy then cascades to turbulence scales and contributes to deep-ocean mixing. The connection of internal waves to deep-ocean mixing is what makes them important. In this thesis we address the problem of energy transfer in internal waves by modelling a two-dimensional flow over idealized topography and analysing the spectra of the generated wave fields. The main tool used is the nonparametric spectral analysis, some aspects of which are reviewed in one of the chapters. The numerical experiments were performed for a number of latitudes, topographies and background flows. The wave field generated by tide-topography interaction includes both progressive and trapped internal waves. The wave spectrum was found to exhibit a self-similar structure with prominent peaks at tidal harmonics and interharmonics, whose magnitudes decay exponentially as a function of the frequency. Subharmonics are generated by an instability of tidal beams, which is particularly strong for near-critical latitudes, where the Coriolis frequency is half the tidal frequency; other interharmonics are produced through resonant and non-resonant triad wave-wave interaction. As the triad interaction can be either resonant or non-resonant, some harmonics and interharmonics correspond to progressive waves, if the frequency is within the free internal wave range, while the others are trapped waves if the frequency is outside the range. Spatial scales of harmonics and interharmonics were investigated. In particular, it was shown that interharmonics typically have smaller vertical scales. Through the use of spatial analysis it was shown that there is a discrete number of wave-wave interactions responsible for the total energy transfer. The results of the thesis provide insight into the complex nature of internal wave interactions and may be helpful for interpreting recent observational results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Effects of the Earth's Rotation on Internal Wave Near-resonant Triads and Weakly Nonlinear Models</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hu, Youna</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis investigates the effects of the earth's rotation on internal waves from two perspectives of nonlinear internal wave theory: near-resonant triads and weakly nonlinear models. We apply perturbation theory (multiple scale analysis) to the governing equations of internal waves and develop a near-resonant internal wave triad theory. This theory explains a resonant-like phenomenon in the numerical results obtained from simulating internal waves generated by tide topography interaction. Furthermore, we find that the inclusion of the earth's rotation (nonzero $f$) in the numerical runs leads to a very special type of resonance: parametric subharmonic instability. Through using perturbation expansion to solve separable solutions to the governing equations of internal waves, we derive a new rotation modified KdV equation (RMKdV). Of particular interest, the dispersion relation of the new equation obeys the exact dispersion relation for internal waves for both small and moderate wavenumbers ($k$). Thus this new RMKdV is able to model wea kly nonlinear internal waves with various wavenumbers ($k$), better than the Ostrovsky equation which fails at describing waves of small $k$.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Signatures of New Physics from the Primordial Universe</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ashoorioon, Amjad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>During inflation quantum fluctuations of the field driving inflation, known as inflaton, were stretched by inflationary expansion to galactic size scales or even larger. A possible implication of inflation -- if it is correct -- is that our observable universe was once of sub-Planckian size. Thus inflation could act as a magnifier to probe the short distance structure of space-time. General arguments about the quantum theory of gravity suggest that the short distance structure of space-time can be modeled as arising from some corrections to the well-known uncertainty relation between the position and momentum operators. Such modifications have been predicted by more fundamental theories such as string theory. This modified commutation relation has been implemented at the first quantized level to the theory of cosmological perturbations. In this thesis, we will show that the aforementioned scenario of implementing the minimal length to the action has an ambiguity: total time derivatives that in continuous space-time could be neglected and do not contribute to the equations of motion, cease to remain total time derivatives as we implement minimal length. Such an ambiguity opens up the possibility for trans-Planckian physics to leave an imprint on the ratio of tensor to scalar fluctuations. In near de-Sitter space, we obtain the explicit dependence of the tensor/scalar on the minimal length. Also the first consistency relation is examined in a power-law background, where it is found that despite the ambiguity that exists in choosing the action, Planck scale physics modifies the consistency relation considerably as it leads to large oscillations in the scalar spectral index in the observable range of scales. In the second part of the thesis, I demonstrate how the assumption of existence of invariant minimal length can assist us to explain the origin of cosmic magnetic fields. The third part of the thesis is dedicated to the study of signatures of M-theory Cascade inflation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Holographic studies of thermal gauge theories with flavour</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Thomson, Rowan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The AdS/CFT correspondence and its extensions to more general gauge/gravity dualities have provided a powerful framework for the study of strongly coupled gauge theories. This thesis explores properties of a large class of thermal strongly coupled gauge theories using the gravity dual. In order to bring the holographic framework closer to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), we study theories with matter in the fundamental representation. In particular, we focus on the holographic dual of SU(Nc) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory coupled to Nf&lt;&lt;Nc flavours of fundamental matter at finite temperature, which is realised as Nf Dq-brane probes in the near horizon (black hole) geometry of Nc black Dp-branes. We explore many aspects of these Dp/Dq brane systems, often focussing on the D3/D7 brane system which is dual to a four dimensional gauge theory. We study the thermodynamics of the Dq-brane probes in the black hole geometry. At low temperature, the branes sit outside the black hole and the meson spectrum is discrete and possesses a mass gap. As the temperature increases, the branes approach a critical solution. Eventually, they fall into the horizon and a phase transition occurs. At large Nc and large 't Hooft coupling, we show that this phase transition is always first order. We calculate the free energy, entropy and energy densities, as well as the speed of sound in these systems. We compute the meson spectrum for brane embeddings outside the horizon and find that tachyonic modes appear where this phase is expected to be unstable from thermodynamic considerations. We study the system at non-zero baryon density nb and find that there is a line of phase transitions for small nb, terminating at a critical point with finite nb. We demonstrate that, to leading order in Nf/Nc, the viscosity to entropy density ratio in these theories saturates the conjectured universal bound. Finally, we compute spectral functions and diffusion constants for fundamental matter in the high temperature phase of the D3/D7 theory.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Investigating Photonic Quantum Computation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Myers, Casey Robert</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The use of photons as qubits is a promising implementation for quantum computation. The inability of photons to interact, especially with the environment, makes them an ideal physical candidate. However, this also makes them a difficult system to perform two qubit gates on. Recent breakthroughs in photonic quantum computing have shown methods around the requirement of direct photon-photon interaction. In this thesis we study three recently discovered schemes for optical quantum computation. We first investigate the so called linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) scheme, exploring a method to improve the original proposal by constructing a photon-number QND detector that succeeds with a high probability. In doing this we present a new type of LOQC teleporter, one that can detect the presence of a single photon in an arbitrary polarisation state when the input state is a sum of vacuum and multi-photon terms. This new type of teleporter is an improvement on the original scheme in that the entangled states required can be made offline with fewer entangling operations. We next investigate the so called quantum bus (qubus) scheme for photonic quantum computing. We show a scheme to measure the party of n qubit states by using a single qubus mode, controlled rotations and displacements. This allows for the syndrome measurements of any stabilizer quantum error correcting code. We extend these results to a fault tolerant scheme to measure an arbitrary Pauli operator of weight n, incorporating so called single bit teleportations. We investigate the construction of a Toffoli gate by using a single qubus mode, controlled rotations and displacements that works with a success probability of at least 25%. We also investigate the use of single bit teleportations to construct a universal set of gates on coherent state type logic and in the construction of cluster states. We finally investigate the optical Zeno gate, a gate that uses the Zeno effect in the form of two photon absorbers to induce a CSIGN. We model realistic two photon absorption and include realistic single photon loss for this gate, examining the use of encoding to overcome the single photon loss, showing that our results are competitive with the leading equivalent LOQC scheme.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Finite-Difference Time-Domain Simulations of Light Scattering from Retinal Photoreceptors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Abdallah, Samer S.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Recently, a novel optical imaging technique was successfully used in measuring the functional response of living retinal tissues. The technique, functional ultra high resolution optical coherence tomography, measures localized differential changes in the retina reflectivity over time resulting from external white light stimulation. This result can be used to develop a non-invasive diagnostic method for the early detection of retinal diseases. However, the physiological causes of the experimentally observed optical signals, most of which originate from the photoreceptors layer, are still not well understood. Due to the complexity of the photoreceptors, using purely experimental methods to isolate the changes in light reflectivity corresponding to individual physiological processes is not feasible. Therefore, we have employed the finite-difference time-domain method to model the changes in light scattering patterns of the photoreceptor cells caused by light-induced physiological processes. Processes such as cell swelling, cell elongation and hyperpolarization of doublelipid membrane structures were simulated by changing the size parameters and optical properties of the cells components. Simulation results show that the hyperpolarization of double-lipid membranous structures and cell swelling are the most likely causes for the experimentally observed changes in optical reflectivity. A number of experiments were suggested to verify the conclusions drawn from this numerical work. This numerical work includes an analysis of various errors in FDTD computational models.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A CFD Investigation of Turbulent Buoyant Helium Plumes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chung, William</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The objective of this work is to assess the capabilities of two modeling approaches, Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES), to investigate turbulent buoyant helium plumes for the purpose of studying the dynamics of buoyancy driven plumes in the near source region. In this case, the velocity and plume concentration of the plume are predicted. RANS was applied to a model planar wall plume and predictions were compared to experimental data gathered in the self-preserving region. It was also used to model an axisymmetric plume with results compared to experimental data gathered in the near source region. The Simple Gradient Diffusion Hypothesis (SGDH) and the Generalized Gradient Diffusion Hypothesis (GGDH) were implemented in the standard k-epsilon model for the planar plume. The CFX buoyancy model in the commercial code, as well as SGDH and GGDH, were applied in predicting the characteristics of the axisymmetric plume. For the planar plume, good agreement with the experimental data was found when the SGDH approach was used. Both spreading rates and maximum values of velocity and mixture fraction were well predicted. Larger discrepancies between predictions and data were noticed with the GGDH model. Both models showed minimal sensitivity to the model constant, C3epsilon. In the case of the axisymmetric plume, all models were highly sensitive to the buoyancy constant. The GGDH model yielded the best results. In particular very good agreement was achieved for the radial profiles of the streamwise velocity. The axisymmetric plume was also simulated using LES. Initially the Smagorinsky constant was set at the default value of 0.2 and the grid size was varied to determine the dependency of the time averaged and rms quantities for velocity and plume concentration on the grid spacing. The two finest meshes tested produced similar time averaged values for velocity and plume concentration indicating that they were less sensitive to grid spacing. These time averaged results also showed that values for streamwise velocity and plume concentration along the central axis were significantly over predicted compared to the experimental results. Time-averaged centerline streamwise velocity plots showed that the streamwise velocity from the numerical results continue to increase while the experimental values begin to decrease after 0.69 m. This indicated that the transition from laminar-toturbulence was poorly predicted. Rms quantities remained sensitive to the mesh spacing even at the finest mesh tested; however the accuracy of the rms results appeared to improve as the grid was refined. Setting the Smagorinsky constant to zero produced a more accurate time averaged predictions but the rms quantities worsened.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Intense laser field ionization of atom and molecular ion</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Long, Zi Jian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In order to understand how does the intense laser interact with matter we first of all study the ionization process. In this highly nonlinear region the conventional perturbation theory will fail to predict the experimental results. Alternative theories have been proposed in the past few decades. The fundamental difficulty in these new approaches is when laser field becomes so intense such that it is comparable to the Coulomb field at where the ground state electron mainly concentrate, we have to treat the laser field and the Coulomb field on an equal footing. The analytical solution that can describe the propagation of electron in both the laser field and the Coulomb field has not been found; therefore, in these new theories the ionization process is either divided temporarily into laser period and Coulomb period or spatially into laser field domain and Coulomb field domain. The propagation of electron in the full Hamiltonian is avoided.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>On the Classification of the R-separable webs for the Laplace equation in E^3</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chanachowicz, Mark</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the first two Chapters I outline the theory and background of separation of variables as an ansatz for solving fundamental partial differential equations (pdes) in Mathematical Physics. Two fundamental approaches will be highlighted, and more modern approaches discussed. In Chapter 3 I calculate the general trace-free conformal Killing tensor defined in Euclidean space - from the sum of symmetric tensor products of conformal Killing vectors. In Chapter 4 I determine the subcases with rotational symmetry and recover known examples pertaining to classical rotational coordinates. In Chapter 5 I obtain the induced action of the conformal group on the space of trace-free conformal Killing tensors. In Chapter 6 I use the invariants of trace-free conformal Killing tensors under the action of the conformal group to characterize, up to equivalence, the symmetric R-separable webs in E^3 that permit conformal separation of variables of the fundamental pdes in Mathematical Physics. In Chapter 7 the asymmetric R-separable metrics are obtained via a study of the separability conditions for the conformally invariant Laplace equation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Stochastic Stability of Flow-Induced Vibration</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhu, Jinyu</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Flow-induced structural vibration is experienced in many engineering applications, such as aerospace industry and civil engineering infrastructures. One of the main mechanisms of flow-induced vibration is instability which can be triggered by parametric excitations or fluid-elastic forces. Experiments show that turbulence has a significant impact on the stability of structures. The objective of this research is to bridge the gap between flow-induced vibration and stochastic stability of structures. The flow-induced vibration of a spring-supported circular cylinder is studied in this research. The equations of motion for the cylinder placed in a cross-flow are set up, in which the vortex force is modeled by a bounded noise because of its narrow-band characteristics. Since the vibration in the lift direction is more prominent in the lock-in region, the system is reduced to one degree-of-freedom, i.e., only the vibration of the cylinder in the lift direction is considered. The equation of motion for the cylinder can be generalized as a two-dimensional system excited by a bounded noise. Stochastic analysis is used to determine the moment Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov exponents for the generalized system. The results are then applied to study the parametric instability of a cylinder in the lock-in region. Fluidelastic instability can occur when the cylinder is placed in a shear flow. The equations of motion are established by using the quasi-steady theory to model the fluid-elastic forces. To study the turbulence effect on the stability of the cylinder, a real noise or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is used to model the grid-generated turbulence. The equations of motion are randomized resulting in a four-dimensional system excited by a real noise. The stability of the stochastic system is studied by determining the moment Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov exponents. Parameters of the system and the noise are varied to investigate their effects on the stability. It is found that the grid-generated turbulence can stabilize the system when the parameters take certain values, which agrees with the experimental observations. Many flow-induced vibration problems can be modeled by a two degrees-of-freedom system parametically excited by a narrow-band process modeled by a bounded noise. The system can be in subharmonic resonance, combination (additive or differential) resonance, or both if the central frequency of the bounded noise takes an appropriate value. The method for a single degree-of-freedom system is extended to study the stochastic stability of the two degrees-of-freedom system. The moment Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov exponents for the three cases are obtained using a perturbation method. The effect of noise on various types of parametric resonance, such as subharmonic resonance, combination additive resonance, and combined subharmonic and combination additive resonance, is investigated. The main contributions of this thesis are stochastic stability analysis of one-degree-of-freedom systems and two-degree-of-freedom systems. Stability analysis for systems under the excitation of real noise and bounded noise is carried out by determining the moment Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov exponents. Good agreement is obtained between analytical results and those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. In the two degrees-of-freedom case, the effect of free stream turbulence on cylinder vibration and its stability is examined.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Vacuum Energy in Expanding Spacetime and Superoscillation - Induced Resonance</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Prain, Angus</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis is divided into two parts. The first part is a study of the general problem of vacuum energy or so-called `zero point fluctuations' of a quantum field on expanding spacetimes and the interplay between the dilution of energy as a mode expands and the generation of energy as new modes enter from below the ultraviolet cutoff. The second deals with the phenomenon of superoscillations and some of the consequences in quantum theory and cosmology. Modern theoretical cosmology sits upon the theory of inflation which assumes that the universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion sometime in the past. Indeed, a whole new scientific discipline was born known as high precision observational cosmology when ground breaking detailed measurements were made in the late 1990's that confirmed some predictions of the theory of inflation. However, inflation is essentially a classical phenomenon with the inclusion of the quantum theory relegated to the provision of initial perturbations of an otherwise homogeneous and isotropic spacetime usually interpreted as the inexorable quantum fluctuations of a (classical) scalar field coupled to the metric. Quantum field theory on curved spacetime, on the other hand, has some novel features in comparison to it's flat spacetime cousin. The inclusion of some of these effects into a discussion of the novel inflationary picture should provide some very interesting and non-trivial insights to the very early universe and perhaps might shed some light on the fundamental nature of the gravitational interaction itself. Usually when studying quantum fields in curved spacetime and the energetic interaction between gravity and the quanta one works in the semi-classical picture where gravity remains a classical field. This is not only because a fully consistent quantum theory of gravity has not been constructed yet. Indeed, there should exist a presumably quite extensive regime where the picture of quantum fields propagating on a classical background remains a valid approximation. In the first part of this thesis we study this regime and some of the interesting physics that arises. Eventually, however, we go one step further than a semi-classical treatment and investigate the hypothesis that the dynamics of cosmologically significant spacetimes is provided by the spacetime dependence of the quantum vacuum energy of a scalar field on that spacetime. Put more simply, we discuss the possibility that the tendency for a spacetime to expand and accelerate it's expansion reduces to the statement that it is vacuum-energetically favorable to do so. The idea that the gravitational degrees of freedom are induced in this way is an old one due to Sakharov and is one represented in this thesis in simplified form and with specific calculations and examples. We find that such an interpretation is at least not excluded and, in fact, sits satisfactorily with the ideas of inflation. Along the way to our conclusive discussion of the `induced cosmology' we discuss, after briefly reviewing inflation and quantum field theory in curved spacetime, the general problem of vacuum energy in curved spacetime and some simplified models of the quantum mechanical ground state energy of a collection of harmonic oscillators on expanding spaces including some discrete models. Our philosophy throughout will be one of pragmatism; we assume a cutoff on momenta (or length scales) at an unspecified energy scale and assume our conclusions hold, if not all the way from the Planck scale (which would presumably be subject to beyond the standard model `quantum gravitational' effects), then at least in some meso-scale between the Hubble scale and the Planck scale. It is certainly true that a quantum scalar field really is a collection of independent harmonic oscillators one for each different comoving length scale (wavelength). The question that we seek to address in this thesis is ``what of the vacuum energy of those modes associated with neither the extreme ultraviolet (where ordinary field theory breaks down) nor the extreme infrared (where ordinary general relativity is assumed to break down)?". After discussing an infrared divergence which we find to be present in a larger class of powerlaw spacetimes than has been previously found, we also implement an infrared cutoff on energies. An interpretation of the infrared cutoff as the realization of a local expansion of a patch of an otherwise flat and very large `ambient' spacetime is attempted and the corresponding picture of an energetic initiation of inflation is provided. The phenomenon of superoscillations for bandlimited functions is the observation that a function may approximate to arbitrary precision a plane wave not contained in it's Fourier decomposition. In particular, it is possible for a function with compact support in the frequency domain to approximate with arbitrary precision a high frequency waveform outside of this support on an arbitrary long interval. This phenomenon has only recently begun to be studied in the literature and as yet very few quantitative results have been obtained. In the second part of this thesis we study the energetic response of a classical and quantum harmonic oscillator driven by a superoscillating driving force. We find that the oscillator indeed responds to the `imposter' driving force as if it were real and, dubbing the response `ghost resonance', we investigate some consequences in quantum field theory and cosmology.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Entanglement Entropy in Quantum Gravity</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Donnelly, William</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We study a proposed statistical explanation for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a black hole in which entropy arises quantum-mechanically as a result of entanglement. Arguments for the identification of black hole entropy with entanglement entropy are reviewed in the framework of quantum field theory, emphasizing the role of renormalization and the need for a physical short-distance cutoff. Our main novel contribution is a calculation of entanglement entropy in loop quantum gravity. The kinematical Hilbert space and spin network states are introduced, and the entanglement entropy of these states is calculated using methods from quantum information theory. The entanglement entropy is compared with the density of states previously computed for isolated horizons in loop quantum gravity, and the two are found to agree up to a topological term. We investigate a conjecture due to Sorkin that the entanglement entropy must be a monotonically increasing function of time under the assumption of causality. For a system described by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, the conjecture is found to be trivial, and for a system described by an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space a counterexample is provided. For quantum states with Euclidean symmetry, the area scaling of the entanglement entropy is shown to be equivalent to the strong additivity condition on the entropy. The strong additivity condition is naturally interpreted in information-theoretic terms as a continuous analog of the Markov property for a classical random variable. We explicitly construct states of a quantum field theory on the one-dimensional real line in which the area law is exactly satisfied.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Defect Detection Via THz Imaging: Potentials &amp; Limitations</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Houshmand, Kaveh</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Until recent years, terahertz (THz) waves were an undiscovered, or most importantly, an unexploited area of electromagnetic spectrum. This was due to difficulties in generation and detection of THz waves. Recent advances in hardware technology have started to open up the field to new applications such as THz imaging. This non-destructive and non-contact imaging technique can penetrate through diverse materials such that internal structures, in some cases invisible to other imaging modalities, can be visualized. Today, there are variety of techniques available to generate and detect THz waves in both pulsed and continuous fashion in two different geometries; transition, and reflection modes. In this thesis continuous wave THz imaging was employed for higher spatial resolution. However, with any new technology comes its challenges; automated processing of THz images can be quite cumbersome. Low contrast and the presence of a widely unknown type of noise make the analysis of these images difficult. In this work, there is an attempt to detect defects in composite material via segmentation by using a Terahertz imaging system. According to our knowledge, this is the first time that this type of materials are being tested under Terahertz cameras to detect manufacturing defects in aerospace industry. In addition, segmentation accuracy of THz images have been investigated by using a phantom. Beyond the defect detection for composite materials, this can establish some general knowledge about Terahertz imaging, its capabilities and limitations. To be able to segment the THz images successfully, pre-processing techniques are inevitable. In this thesis, a variety of different image processing techniques, self-developed or available from literature, have been employed for image enhancement. These methods range from filtering to contrast adjustment to fusion of phase and amplitude images by using fuzzy set theory, to just name a few. The result of pre-procssing and segmentation methods demonstrates promising outcome for future work in this field.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Interplay of Disorder and Transverse-Field Induced Quantum Fluctuations in the LiHo_xY_{1-x}F_4 Ising Magnetic Material</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tabei, Seyed Mohiaddeen Ali</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The LiHo_xY_{1-x}F_4 magnetic material in a transverse magnetic field B_x perpendicular to the Ising spin direction has long been used to study tunable quantum phase transitions in pure and random disordered systems. We first present analytical and numerical evidences for the validity of an effective spin-1/2 approach to the description of a general dipolar spin glass model with strong uniaxial Ising anisotropy and subject to weak B_x. We relate this toy model to the LiHo_xY_{1-x}F_4 transverse field Ising material. We show that an effective spin-1/2 model is able to capture both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the physics at small B_x. After confirming the validity of the effective spin-1/2 approach, we show that the field-induced magnetization along the x direction, combined with the local random dilution-induced destruction of crystalline mirror symmetries generates, via the predominant dipolar interactions between Ho^{3+} ions, random fields along the Ising z direction. This identifies LiHo_xY_{1-x}F_4 in B_x as a new random field Ising system. We show that the random fields explain the smearing of the nonlinear susceptibility at the spin glass transition with increasing B_x. In this thesis, we also investigate the phase diagram of non-diluted LiHoF_4 in the presence of B_x, by performing Monte-Carlo simulations. A previous quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation found that even for small B_x where quantum fluctuations are small, close to the classical critical point, there is a discrepancy between experiment and the QMC results. We revisit this problem, focusing on weak B_x close to the classical T_c, using an alternative approach. For small B_x, by applying a so-called cumulant expansion, the quantum fluctuations around the classical T_c are taken into account perturbatively. We derived an effective perturbative classical Hamiltonian, on which MC simulations are performed. With this method we investigate different proposed sources of uncertainty which can affect the numerical results. We fully reproduce the previous QMC results at small B_x. Unfortunately, we find that none of the modifications to the microscopic Hamiltonian that we explore are able to provide a B_x-T phase diagram compatible with the experiments in the small semi-classical B_x regime.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Black Hole Thermodynamics and the Tunnelling Method for Particle Emission</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kerner, Ryan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The semi-classical black hole tunnelling method is a useful technique to calculate black hole temperature and understand black hole thermodynamics. I will investigate the black hole tunnelling method in detail. I will compare two different approaches used to calculate black hole tunnelling. The tunnelling method can be applied to a broad range of spacetimes and I will show this explicitly in order to demonstrate the robustness of the tunnelling technique. In particular, I will apply the tunnelling method to spacetimes including: Rindler (the method can recover the Unruh temperature), and more general spacetimes (such as Kerr-Newman and Taub-NUT). I will also discuss the 5d Kerr-Gödel spacetimes in detail (while showing a previous unobserved property of these spaces). Once the parameter space of Kerr-Gödel is understood in detail, I will show how the tunnelling method can also be successfully applied to the Kerr-Gödel black hole. Finally, the key result of my thesis involves extending the tunnelling method to model fermion emission. The previous tunnelling calculations all involved the emission of scalar particles. I will model the emission of spin-1/2 fermions from various spacetimes including the Rindler spacetime and general non-rotating black holes. I will also model the emission of charged spin-1/2 fermions from the Kerr-Newman spacetime to show that the method is also applicable to rotating spacetimes. In all these cases I show that the correct Hawking temperature (Unruh temperature in the case of Rindler) is recovered for spin-1/2 fermion emission. Although this final result is not surprising, it is an important result because it confirms that Dirac particles will radiate from the black hole at the same temperature as scalar particles. It has always been assumed that this is the case but there is very little literature involving fermion radiation of black holes. So the results of my calculations are twofold, I demonstrate that Dirac particles are emitted at the same temperature as scalar particles from a black hole and it shows how robust the semi-classical tunnelling technique is.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Unsteady Free Convection from Elliptic Tubes at Large Grashof Numbers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Perera, Ranmal</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This study solves the problem of unsteady free convection from an inclined heated tube both numerically and analytically. The tube is taken to have an elliptic cross-section having a constant heat flux applied to its surface. The surrounding fluid is viscous and incompressible and infinite in extent. The Boussinesq approximation is used to describe the buoyancy force driving the flow. The underlying assumptions made in this work are that the flow remains laminar and two-dimensional for all time. This enables the Navier-Stokes and energy equations to be formulated in terms of the streamfunction, and vorticity. We assume that initially an impulsive heat flux is applied to the surface and that both the tube and surrounding fluid have the same initial temperature. The problem is solved subject to the no-slip and constant heat flux conditions on the surface together with quiescent far-field and initial conditions. An approximate analytical-numerical solution was derived for small times, t and large Grashof numbers, Gr. This was done by expanding the flow variables in a double series in terms of two small parameters and reduces to solving a set of differential equations. The first few terms were solved exactly while the higher-order terms were determined numerically. Flow characteristics presented include average surface temperature plots as well as surface vorticity and surface temperature distributions. The results demonstrate that the approximate analytical-numerical solution is in good agreement with the fully numerical solution for small t and large Gr.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>On the Hardness of the Quantum Separability Problem and the Global Power of Locally Invariant Unitary Operations</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gharibian, Sevag</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Given a bipartite density matrix ρ of a quantum state, the Quantum Separability problem (QUSEP) asks — is ρ entangled, or separable? In this thesis, we first strengthen Gurvits’ 2003 NP-hardness result for QUSEP by showing that the Weak Membership problem over the set of separable bipartite quantum states is strongly NP-hard, meaning it is NP-hard even when the error margin is as large as inverse polynomial in the dimension, i.e. is “moderately large”. Previously, this NP-hardness was known only to hold in the case of inverse exponential error. We observe the immediate implication of NP-hardness of the Weak Membership problem over the set of entanglement-breaking maps, as well as lower bounds on the maximum (Euclidean) distance possible between a bound entangled state and the separable set of quantum states (assuming P ≠ NP). We next investigate the entanglement-detecting capabilities of locally invariant unitary operations, as proposed by Fu in 2006. Denoting the subsystems of ρ as A and B, such that ρ_B = Tr_A(ρ), a locally invariant unitary operation U^B is one with the property U^B ρ_B (U^B)^† = ρ_B. We investigate the maximum shift (in Euclidean distance) inducible in ρ by applying I⊗U^B, over all locally invariant choices of U^B. We derive closed formulae for this quantity for three cases of interest: (pseudo)pure quantum states of arbitrary dimension, Werner states of arbitrary dimension, and two-qubit states. Surprisingly, similar to recent anomalies detected for non-locality measures, the first of these formulae demonstrates the existence of non-maximally entangled states attaining shifts as large as maximally entangled ones. Using the latter of these formulae, we demonstrate for certain classes of two-qubit states an equivalence between the Fu criterion and the CHSH inequality. Among other results, we investigate the ability of locally invariant unitary operations to detect bound entanglement.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Improved image speckle noise reduction and novel dispersion cancellation in Optical Coherence Tomography</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Puvanathasan, Prabakar</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an innovative modern biomedical imaging technology that allows in-vivo, non-invasive imaging of biological tissues. At present, some of the major challenges in OCT include the need for fast data acquisition system for probing fast developing biochemical processes in biological tissue, for image processing algorithms to reduce speckle noise and to remove motion artefacts, and for dispersion compensation to improve axial resolution and image contrast. To address the need for fast data acquisition, a novel, high speed (47,000 A-scans/s), ultrahigh axial resolution (3.3μm) Fourier Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (FD-OCT) system in the 1060nm wavelength region has been built at the University of Waterloo. The system provides 3.3μm image resolution in biological tissue and maximum sensitivity of 110 dB. Retinal tomograms acquired in-vivo from a human volunteer and a rat animal model show clear visualization of all intra-retinal layers and increased penetration into the choroid. OCT is based on low-coherence light interferometry. Thus, image quality is dependent on the spatial and temporal coherence properties of the optical waves back-scattered from the imaged object. Due to the coherent nature of light, OCT images are contaminated with speckle noise. Two novel speckle noise reduction algorithms based on interval type II fuzzy sets has been developed to improve the quality of the OCT images. One algorithm is a combination of anisotropic diffusion and interval type II fuzzy system while the other algorithm is based on soft thresholding wavelet coefficients using interval type II fuzzy system. Application of these novel algorithms to Cameraman test image corrupted with speckle noise (variance=0.1) resulted in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.07 for both fuzzy anisotropic diffusion and fuzzy wavelet algorithms. This value is less compared to the results obtained for Wiener (RMSE=0.09), adaptive Lee (RMSE=0.09), and median (RMSE=0.12) filters. Applying the algorithms to optical coherence tomograms acquired in-vivo from a human finger-tip show reduction in the speckle noise and image SNR improvement of ~13dB for fuzzy anisotropic diffusion and ~11db for fuzzy wavelet. Comparison with the Wiener (SNR improvement of ~3dB), adaptive Lee (SNR improvement of ~5dB) and median (SNR improvement of ~5dB) filters, applied to the same images, demonstrates the better performance of the fuzzy type II algorithms in terms of image metrics improvement. Micrometer scale OCT image resolution is obtained via use of broad bandwidth light sources. However, the large spectral bandwidth of the imaging beam results in broadening of the OCT interferogram because of the dispersive properties of the imaged objects. This broadening causes deterioration of the axial resolution and as well as loss of contrast in OCT images. A novel even-order dispersion cancellation interferometry via a linear, classical interferometer has been developed which can be further expanded to dispersion canceled OCT.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Statistical Fingerprints of Quantum Gravity</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ansari, Mohammad Hossein</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis some equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical methods are implied on two different versions of non-perturbative quantum gravity. Firstly, we report a novel statistical mechanics in which a class of evolutionary maps act on trivalent spin network in randomly chosen initial states and give rise to Self-organized Criticality. The result of continuously applying these maps indicate an expansion in the space-time area associated. Secondly, a previously unknown statistical mechanics in quantum gravity is introduced in the framework of two dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations. This provides us a useful and new tools to understand this quantum gravity in terms of effective spins. This study reveals a correspondence between the statistics of Anti-ferromagnetic systems and Causal Dynamical quantum gravity. More importantly, it provides a basis for studying anti-ferromagnetic systems in a background independent way. Thirdly, two novel properties of area operator in Loop Quantum Gravity are reported: 1) the generic degeneracy and 2) the ladder symmetry. These were not known previously for years. The first one indicates that corresponding to any eigenvalue of area operator in loop quantum gravity there exists a finite number of degenerate eigenstates. This degeneracy is shown to be one way for the explanation of black hole entropy in a microscopic way. More importantly, we reproduce Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black hole by comparing the minimal energy of a decaying frequency from a loop quantum black hole and the extracted energy from a perturbed black hole in the highly damping mode. This consistency reveals a treasure model for describing a black hole in loop quantum gravity that does nor suffer from the restrictions of an isolated horizon. The second property indicates there exists a ladder symmetry unexpectedly in the complete spectrum of area eigenvalues. This symmetry suggests the eigenvalues of area could be classified into different evenly spaced subsets, each called a `generation.' All generations are evenly spaced; but the gap between the levels in any every generation is unique. One application of the two new properties of area operator have been considered here for introducing a generalized picture of horizon whose area cells are not restricted to the subset considered in quantum isolated horizon theory. Instead, the area cells accepts values from the complete spectrum. Such horizon in the presence of all elements of diffeomorphism group contains a number of degrees of freedom independently from the bulk freedom whose logarithm scales with the horizon area. Note that this is not the case in quantum isolated horizon when the complete elements of diffeomorphism applies. Finally, we use a simple statistical method in which no pre-assumption is made for the essence of the energy quanta radiated from the hole. We derive the effects of the black hole horizon fluctuations and reveal a new phenomenon called "quantum amplification effects" affecting black hole radiation. This effect causes unexpectedly a few un-blended radiance modes manifested in spectrum as discrete brightest lines. The frequency of these modes scales with the mass of black hole. This modification to Hawking's radiation indicates a window at which loop quantum gravity can be observationally tested at least for primordial black holes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Progress on the application of the NS-alpha model to wall-bounded flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Scott, Katharine Andrea</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis we study the NS-alpha model of flow turbulence. In this model the closure arises through a modified nonlinearity. For the NS-alpha model currently used in published numerical studies, the parameter representing turbulent fluctuations, alpha, is a scalar and is assumed to be a constant. This corresponds to homogeneous, isotropic fluctuations. In this thesis we investigate the NS-alpha model for the more practical situation where fluctuations may be inhomogeneous and anisotropic. We begin by reviewing the derivation of the governing equations using Hamilton's principle. This is followed by the formulation of a subgrid model, where the dependent variable is the smoothed velocity. The isotropic and anisotropic subgrid models are then tested on a recirculating cavity flow and a fully turbulent channel flow. Initial tests used a simple definition of the model parameter based on the grid size. Two specific problems with the model in these test cases were isolated and addressed. For the cavity flow we found abrupt changes in the model parameter at the solid boundary led to numerical oscillations. To overcome this problem an alternative definition was proposed and found to produce improved turbulence statistics. For the channel flow, interaction between the model and the velocity streaks near the wall led to high skin friction. A damping factor through the streak-affected region removed this problem.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Hybrid Numerical Simulation Approach for Turbulent Flows over Building-Like Obstacles</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hsieh, Kun-Jung</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been widely applied to simulate turbulent flows in an urban environment. The two basic methodologies in CFD that have been applied here are a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) modeling and a large-eddy simulation (LES). The nature of the flow in a built-up urban area consisting of an arbitrary aggregation of buildings is dominated by unsteady large-scale turbulent structures. Recognizing that RANS is unable to correctly capture these turbulent structures while LES is associated with high computational costs, a hybrid RANS/LES methodology that combines the computational efficiency of RANS with the predictive accuracy of LES can be a promising simulation approach for the application to urban flows. In the non-zonal approach of hybrid RANS/LES methodology, a single generalized turbulence model is used in the entire computational domain. This model can function as a RANS turbulence closure model or as a LES subgrid scale model, depending on the local grid resolution or flow properties. A variant of non-zonal approaches, referred as partially resolved numerical simulation (PRNS) in this study, obtains the generalized turbulence model from the rescaling of a conventional RANS model through the incorporation of a resolution control function (F_R). The resolution control function F_R is used to characterize the degree of modeling required to represent the unresolved scales of motion. A new generalized functional form for F_R in PRNS is proposed in this thesis. The predictive performance of PRNS is compared with unsteady RANS (URANS) and LES computations, for a plane channel flow, and for fully-developed and developing flows over a matrix of cubes resembling a group of buildings. It is demonstrated that PRNS behaves similarly to LES, in terms of the predictions of the mean flow and turbulence, but outperforms URANS in general. This indicates PRNS is a promising approach for the simulation of complex turbulent flows in an urban environment.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Theory of measurement-based quantum computing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>de Beaudrap, Jonathan Robert Niel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the study of quantum computation, data is represented in terms of linear operators which form a generalized model of probability, and computations are most commonly described as products of unitary transformations, which are the transformations which preserve the quality of the data in a precise sense. This naturally leads to unitary circuit models, which are models of computation in which unitary operators are expressed as a product of "elementary" unitary transformations. However, unitary transformations can also be effected as a composition of operations which are not all unitary themselves: the one-way measurement model is one such model of quantum computation. In this thesis, we examine the relationship between representations of unitary operators and decompositions of those operators in the one-way measurement model. In particular, we consider different circumstances under which a procedure in the one-way measurement model can be described as simulating a unitary circuit, by considering the combinatorial structures which are common to unitary circuits and two simple constructions of one-way based procedures. These structures lead to a characterization of the one-way measurement patterns which arise from these constructions, which can then be related to efficiently testable properties of graphs. We also consider how these characterizations provide automatic techniques for obtaining complete measurement-based decompositions, from unitary transformations which are specified by operator expressions bearing a formal resemblance to path integrals. These techniques are presented as a possible means to devise new algorithms in the one-way measurement model, independently of algorithms in the unitary circuit model.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>WKB Analysis of Tunnel Coupling in a Simple Model of a Double Quantum Dot</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Platt, Edward</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A simplified model of a double quantum dot is presented and analyzed, with applications to spin-qubit quantum computation. The ability to trap single electrons in semiconductor nanostructures has led to the proposal of quantum computers with spin-based qubits coupled by the exchange interaction. Current theory predicts an exchange interaction with a -1 power-law dependence on the detuning ϵ, the energy offset between the two dots. However, experiment has shown a -3/2 power-law dependence on ϵ. Using WKB analysis, this thesis explores one possible source of the modified dependence, namely an ϵ-dependent tunnel coupling between the two wells. WKB quantization is used to find expressions for the tunnel coupling of a one-dimensional double-well, and these results are compared to the exact, numerical solutions, as determined by the finite difference method and the transfer matrix method. Small ϵ-dependent corrections to the tunnel coupling are observed. In typical cases, WKB correctly predicts a constant tunnel coupling at leading-order. WKB also predicts small ϵ-dependent corrections for typical cases and strongly ϵ-dependent tunnel couplings for certain exceptional cases. However, numerical simulations suggest that WKB is not accurate enough to analyze the small corrections, and is not valid in the exceptional cases. Deviations from the conventional form of the low-energy Hamiltonian for a double-well are also observed and discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Comparative Study of the SIMPLE and Fractional Step Time Integration Methods for Transient Incompressible Flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hines, Jonathan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Time integration methods are necessary for the solution of transient flow problems. In recent years, interest in transient flow problems has increased, leading to a need for better understanding of the costs and benefits of various time integration schemes. The present work investigates two common time integration schemes, namely the Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations (SIMPLE) and the Fractional Step (FS) method. Three two-dimensional, transient, incompressible flow problems are solved using a cell centered, finite volume code. The three test cases are laminar flow in a lid-driven skewed cavity, laminar flow over a square cylinder, and turbulent flow over a square cylinder. Turbulence is modeled using wall functions and the k - ε turbulence model with the modifications suggested by Kato and Launder. Solution efficiency as measured by the effort carried out by the flow equation solver and CPU time is examined. Accuracy of the results, generated using the SIMPLE and FS time integration schemes, is analyzed through a comparison of the results with existing experimental and/or numerical solutions. Both the SIMPLE and FS algorithms are shown to be capable of solving benchmark flow problems with reasonable accuracy. The two schemes differ slightly in their prediction of flow evolution over time, especially when simulating very slowly changing flows. As the time step size decreases, the SIMPLE algorithm computational cost (CPU time) per time step remains approximately constant, while the FS method experiences a reduction in cost per time step. Also, the SIMPLE algorithm is numerically stable for time steps approaching infinity, while the FS scheme suffers from numerical instability if the time step size is too large. As a result, the SIMPLE algorithm is recommended to be used for transient simulations with large time steps or steady state problems while the FS scheme is better suited for small time step solutions, although both time-stepping schemes are found to be most efficient when their time steps are at their maximum stable value.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Bulk Scattering Approximations for Collimated Light Transmitted through Paper</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chen, Tenn Francis</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Paper is a complex fibrous material whose production involves substantial amounts of natural and industrial resources. To reduce its manufacturing costs, the pulp and paper industry often employs optical technology such as high sensitivity laser sensors used to measure physical parameters like thickness and opacity. More recently, computer simulations of paper optical properties are also being used to accelerate the research cycle required to the development of new types of paper. In these simulations, the bulk scattering of paper is usually approximated by analytical formulas, notably the Henyey-Greenstein function. In this work, we qualitatively investigate the degree of accuracy of such approximations with respect to collimated light. More specifically, an experimental set-up was devised to record the transmission of red and green HeNe lasers through different paper samples. The measured data was compared with data obtained using the Henyey-Greenstein function and data obtained using an alternative exponentiated cosine function. The comparisons are used to qualitatively assess the degree of accuracy of the bulk scattering approximations provided by both functions. This work closes with a discussion on the practical implications of our findings for the modeling of paper optical properties.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Materials physics of half-metallic magnetic oxide films by Pulsed Laser Deposition: Controlling the crystal structure and near-surface properties of Sr2FeMoO6 and CrO2 films</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jalili, Helia</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The idea of half-metallic ferromagnets was first introduced by de Groot et al. in 1983 based on their calculations. The density of state at the Fermi level for half-metallic ferromagnet is completely polarized, meaning that only one of the spin up or spin down channel exists and has metallic behaviour while the other spin channel behaves as a semiconductor or insulator. This unusual electronic structure can be seen in different materials including Sr2FeMoO6, CrO2 and Mn-based Heusler alloys. The high spin polarization degree of the half-metallic ferromagnets makes them a perfect candidate to be used as a spin-injector/detector in spin-based electronics device (spintronics). However, the degree of spin polarization of these materials, particularly in the multilayered structure spintronic devices, strongly depends on the surface/interface quality and the presence of defects, which was the subject of the present study. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) has been used to grow two examples of the half-metallic ferromagnets, namely, Sr2FeMoO6 and CrO2. The effects of the growth conditions (deposition temperature, gas pressure, laser power, target-to-substrate distance, post-annealing) and of the substrate lattice mismatch and thickness evolution have been studied. By optimizing the growth conditions, nanocrystalline Sr2FeMoO6 films have been grown on a Si(100) substrate for the first time. This single-phase Sr2FeMoO6 film was obtained at a temperature as low as 600°C, and it exhibits a high saturation magnetic moment of 3.4 μB per formula unit at 77 K. By using glancing-incidence X-ray diffraction with different incident beam angles, the crystal structure of the film was sampled as a function of depth. Despite the lack of good lattice matching with the Si substrate, a preferential orientation of the nanocrystals in the film was observed for the as-grown Sr2FeMoO6 films thicker than 60 nm. Furthermore, effects of the deposition temperature on the epitaxial growth of the Sr2FeMoO6 films on MgO(001) have been studied by means of high-resolution X-ray diffraction. The film grown at 800°C was post-annealed in oxygen, producing epitaxial films of SrMoO4 on top of the Sr2FeMoO6 film. The corresponding magnetization data showed that the post-annealing treatment lowered the saturation magnetic moment from 3.4 µB per formula unit (or /f.u.) for the as-grown Sr2FeMoO6 film to 1.4 µB/f.u. after annealing. X-ray photoemission measurements as a function of sputtering time further revealed the presence of SrMoO4 on both the as-grown and annealed films, and their corresponding depth profiles indicated a thicker SrMoO4 overlayer on the annealed film. The intensity ratios of the 3d features of Mo4+, Mo5+, and Mo6+ for Sr2FeMoO6 remained unchanged with sputtering depth (after 160 s of sputtering), supporting the conclusion that the observed secondary phase (SrMoO4) was formed predominantly on the surface and not in the sub-grain boundaries of the as-grown Sr2FeMoO6 film. The epitaxial growth evolution of Sr2FeMoO6 films of different thickness on substrates of MgO(001), SrTiO3(100) and LaAlO3(100) have also been studied. For each thickness, surface morphology, grain size, film epitaxy, and crystal quality were determined by atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction (-2θ scan and reciprocal space mapping). For thicker films (~120 nm), high resolution X-ray diffraction studies revealed that SrMoO4 and other parasitic phases tend to forms on SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 substrates, but not on those grown on MgO substrates. As a second part of the project, single-phase CrO2 nanostructured thin films have been grown for the first time directly on MgO(001) by PLD from a metallic Cr target in an O2 environment. X-ray diffraction shows that these films are strained and consist of CrO2 crystallites with two possible epitaxial relationships to the substrate: either CrO2(110) or CrO2(200) is parallel to MgO(001). X-ray photoemission further confirms that the films are primarily CrO2 covered with a thin CrO3 overlayer, and indicates its complete synthesis without any residual metallic Cr.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Cosmological Results and Implications in Effective DGP</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chow, Lik-Neng Nathan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We study a simple extension of the decoupling limit of boundary effctive actions for the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model, by covariantizing the π lagrangian and coupling to gravity in the usual way. This extension agrees with DGP to leading order in Mpl^−1 , and simplifies the cosmological analysis. It is also shown to softly break the shift symmetry, while still being consistent with solar system observations. The generally covariant equations of motion for π and the metric are derived, then the cosmology is developed under the Cosmological Principle. Three analytic solutions are found and their stability is studied. Interesting DGP phenomenology is reproduced, and we consider one of the stable solutions. The cosmological analogue of the Vainshtein effect is reproduced and the effective equation of state, w_π, is shown to be bounded by −1 from above. This solution is additionally shown to be an attractor solution in an expanding universe. We evolve π numerically and reproduce these properties, and show that the universe will go through a contraction phase, due to this π ﬁeld. We then place a constraint on r_c ≥ 10^29 cm, given recent WMAP5 data. This lower bound on r_c gives an upper bound on the anomalous perihelion precession of the moon ∼ 1 × 10^−13, 2 orders of magnitude below current experimental precision.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fast Methods for Millimeter-wave Dielectric Resonator and Antenna Analysis and Design</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chen, Huanyu</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Ever-increasing interest in millimeter-wave and terahertz spectrum has prompted research and development of novel passive components working at these frequencies. Compared with the conventional planar components, non-planar dielectric devices become more attractive as frequencies increase due to their higher quality factors and dimensional tolerances. In this thesis, we present fast methods to analyze the millimeter-wave dielectric resonator and rod antenna. First, an analytical method has been developed to evaluate resonant frequencies, quality factors of the Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) disk resonators and also the resonator-waveguide coupling. A numerical solver based on full-wave finite element method is implemented to verify the analytical result. This analytical model provides a solution for fast design and optimization of WGM resonators in filter and sensor applications. Secondly, a fast analytical approach based on local mode theory is introduced to calculate the radiation from tapered dielectric rod antenna. This efficient approximate model consumes much less computing resources and time, and demonstrates good agreements with full-wave numerical results. It supplies a quantitative way to understand the radiation mechanism and interaction between different parts of the antenna. Based on this, design criteria for the taper profile of rod antennas are given.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nondestructive Evaluation of the Depth of Cracks in Concrete Plates Using Surface Waves</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yang, Yanjun</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Concrete structures can often be modeled as plates, for example, bridges, tunnel walls and pipes. Near-surface damage in concrete structures mostly takes the form of cracking. Surface-breaking cracks affect concrete properties and structural integrity; therefore, the nondestructive evaluation of crack depth is important for structural monitoring, strengthening and rehabilitation. On the other hand, material damping is a fundamental parameter for the dynamic analysis of material specimens and structures. Monitoring damping changes is useful for the assessment of material conditions and structural deterioration. The main objective of this research is to develop new methodologies for depth evaluation of surface-breaking cracks and the evaluation of damping in concrete plates. Nondestructive techniques based on wave propagation are useful because they are non-intrusive, efficient and cost effective. Previous studies for the depth evaluation of surface-breaking cracks in concrete have used diffracted compressional waves (P-waves). However, surface waves exhibit better properties for the characterization of near surface defects, because (a) surface waves dominate the surface response, they carry 67% of the wave propagation energy, and present lower geometrical attenuation because the propagating wave front is cylindrical; and (b) the penetration depth of Rayleigh waves (R-waves) depends on their frequency. Most of the R-wave energy concentrates at a depth of one-third of their wavelengths. The transmission of R-waves through a surface-breaking crack depends on the crack depth; this depth sensitivity is the basis for the so-called Fourier transmission coefficient (FTC) method. R-waves only exist in a half-space (one traction-free surface); whereas in the case of a plate (two traction-free surfaces), Lamb modes are generated. Fundamental Lamb modes behave like R-waves at high frequencies, because their wavelengths are small relative to the plate thickness. Lamb modes are not considered in the standard FTC method, and the FTC method is also affected by the selected spacing between receivers. The FTC calculation requires the use of an explicit time window for the identification of the arrival of surface waves, and the selection of a reliable frequency range. This research presents theoretical, numerical and experimental results. Theoretical aspects of Lamb modes are discussed, and a theoretical transfer function is derived, which can be used to study changes of Lamb modes in the time and frequency domains as a function of distance. The maximum amplitude of the wavelet transform varies with distance because of the dispersion of Lamb modes and the participation of higher Lamb modes in the response. Numerical simulations are conducted to study the wave propagation of Lamb modes through a surface-breaking crack with different depths. The surface response is found to be dominated by the fundamental Lamb mode. Using the 2D Fourier transform, the incident, transmitted and reflected fundamental Lamb modes are extracted. A transmission ratio between the transmitted and incident modes is calculated, which is sensitive to crack depths (d) normalized to the wavelength (λ) in a range (d / λ) = 0.1 to 1/3. A new wavelet transmission coefficient (WTC) method for the depth evaluation of surface-breaking cracks in concrete is proposed to overcome the main limitations of the FTC method. The WTC method gives a global coefficient that is correlated with the crack depth, which does not require time windowing and the pre-selection of a frequency bandwidth. To reduce the effects of wave reflections, which are present in the FTC method because of the non-equal spacing configuration, a new equal spacing configuration is used in the WTC method. The effects of Lamb mode dispersion are also reduced. In laboratory tests, an ultrasonic transmitter with central frequency at 50kHz is used as a source; the 50kHz frequency is appropriate for the concrete plate tested (thickness 80mm), because the fundamental Lamb modes have converged to the Rayleigh wave mode. The new method has also been used in-situ at Hanson Pipe and Precast Inc., Cambridge, Ontario, Canada, and it shows potential for practical applications. In general, the evaluation of material damping is more difficult than the measurement of wave velocity; the dynamic response and attenuation of structural vibrations are predominantly controlled by damping, and the damping is typically evaluated using the modal analysis technique, which requires considerable efforts. The existing methods based on surface waves, use the Fourier transform to measure material damping; however, an explicit time window is required for the spectral ratio method to extract the arrival of surface wave; in addition, a slope of the spectral ratio varies for different frequency ranges, and thus a reliable frequency range needs to be determined. This research uses the wavelet transform to measure material damping in plates, where neither an explicit time window nor the pre-selection of a frequency bandwidth are required. The measured material damping represents an average damping for a frequency range determined by source. Both numerical and experimental results show good agreement and the potential for practical applications.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>On near-free-surface dynamics of thin polymer films</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Qi, Dongping</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Studies show that dynamical properties of ultra-thin polymer films deviate from those of bulk materials. Despite some controversial issues, there is growing evidence indicating that the interfacial properties play a key role for observed dynamical anomalies. However, how and how much the interfacial properties affect the average dynamics of the nanometer scale systems are still elusive. In this work, we developed several novel techniques to investigate near-free-surface dynamics of thin polymer films. We studied surface dynamics of glassy i-PMMA films using a nano surface hole relaxation technique: a strong substrate property dependence and an unexpected molecular weight dependence were observed; we found that a local Tg of ~40K below bulk Tg could be assigned to the surface region. We used nano gold particle embedding to study PS surface dynamics: enhanced surface dynamics and weak temperature dependence were observed for the surface region; a depth profile with the nm resolution was observed; viscous liquid-like and soft solid-like properties were observed in the first 5.5nm and next 3.3 nm regions in PS films; no molecualr weight dependence was found in glassy PS films. We built a low level noise measurement system to study the thermal polarization noise in PVAc films: cooperative rearranging dynamics were evidenced; the noise power spectral density (PSD) is found to fluctuate around a certain average level without discernable peak shift; we observed some relatively big jumps or fluctuations in successive integrated PSD’s, which indicate some energy exchange between different microscopic domains in glassy polymer systems. We developed a novel nano rheology AFM technique to study the near-free-surface dynamics of thin polymer films: enhanced near-free-surface dynamics with weak temperature dependence are observed for PVAc films, which is similar with the PS case.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical Simulation of Surface Waves using Meshfree Methods</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wickramarachchi, Subasha</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a Lagrangian-based numerical method used for simulating problems in fluid and solid mechanics. In this thesis, a basic introduction to particle and Smoothed Particle (SP) approximations is given first. Application of SP approximations to Euler and Navier-Stokes equations is discussed, followed by an improvement to restore first order consistency in SPH. Then, simulations of 2D free-surface waves in a weakly incompressible fluid are conducted. If the artificial viscosity used is small, results indicate that the accuracy of SPH scheme is reasonably good; however, a low artificial viscosity leads to a rugged air-water interface. Furthermore, application of the LES filter has negligible effects. It is also observed that the use of Renormalized SPH (R-SPH) increases diffusivity but does not increase accuracy significantly. Hence, for 2D surface waves in weakly incompressible fluids, basic SPH formulation without any modification is as good as the R-SPH or LES-SPH methods.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A High-Resolution Hydrodynamic Investigation of Brown Trout (Salmo trutta) and Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Redds</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Marchildon, Mason</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>High-resolution velocity measurements were undertaken over a series of redds and riffles on a gravel-bed stream to quantify the hydrodynamics preferred by spawning brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) for redd-site selection. On each riffle studied, over 6,000 velocity measurements per day were acquired to quantify the velocity, depth, Reynolds number, Froude number, bed shear, and turbulent kinetic energy per unit area of streambed in attempts to relate fluid properties to redd-site selection, relative to remaining riffle structures. Results showed that velocity, Reynolds number, and Froude number vary widely at the redd- and riffle-scale with no apparent correlation to spawning location preference. Turbulent kinetic energy per unit area consistently demonstrated a strong correlation with redd locations whereby the metric maintained low values (i.e., unidirectional flow with little turbulence) where redds and attempted redds were observed. Habitat suitability indices were applied at the reach-, riffle-, and redd-scale using the results of the high-resolution velocity measurements. Findings demonstrated that habitat suitability indices, which are based on reach-scale hydraulics, were adequately represented at the reach scale. However, by decreasing the scale to the riffle- or redd-scale, where increasing heterogeneity in the flow regime is revealed, habitat suitability indices failed to adequately reflect the habitat conditions preferred by the spawning fish.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Flow Separation on the β-plane</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Steinmoeller, Derek</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In non-rotating fluids, boundary-layer separation occurs when the nearly inviscid flow just outside a viscous boundary-layer experiences an appreciable deceleration due to a region of adverse pressure gradient. The fluid ceases to flow along the boundary due to a flow recirculation region close to the boundary. The flow is then said to be "detached." In recent decades, attention has shifted to the study of boundary-layer separation in a rotating reference frame due to its significance in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD). Since the Earth is a rotating sphere, the so-called β-plane approximation f = f0 + βy is often used to account for the inherent meridional variation of the Coriolis parameter, f, while still solving the governing equations on a plane. Numerical simulations of currents on the β-plane have been useful in understanding ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream, the Brazil Current, and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to name a few. In this thesis, we first consider the problem of prograde flow past a cylindrical obstacle on the β-plane. The problem is governed by the barotropic vorticity equation and is solved using a numerical method that is a combination of a finite difference method and a spectral method. A modified form of the β-plane approximation is proposed to avoid computational difficulties. Results are given and discussed for flow past a circular cylinder at selected Reynolds numbers (Re) and non-dimensional β-parameters (β^). Results are then given and discussed for flow past an elliptic cylinder of a fixed aspect ratio (r = 0.2) and at two angles of inclination (90°, 15°) at selected Re and β^. In general, it is found that the β-effect acts to suppress boundary-layer separation and to allow Rossby waves to form in the exterior flow field. In the asymmetrical case of an inclined elliptic cylinder, the β-effect was found to constrain the region of vortex shedding to a small region near the trailing edge of the cylinder. The shed vortices were found to propagate around the trailing edge instead of in the expected downstream direction, as observed in the non-rotating case. The second problem considered in this thesis is the separation of western boundary currents from a curved coastline. This problem is also governed by the barotropic vorticity equation, and it is solved on an idealized model domain suitable for investigating the effects that boundary curvature has on the tendency of a boundary current to separate. The numerical method employed is a two-dimensional Chebyshev spectral collocation method and yields high order accuracy that helps to better resolve the boundary-layer dynamics in comparison to low-order methods. Results are given for a selection of boundary curvatures, non-dimensional β-parameters (β^), Reynolds numbers (Re), and Munk Numbers (Mu). In general, it is found than an increase in β^ will act to suppress boundary-layer separation. However, a sufficiently sharp obstacle can overcome the β-effect and force the boundary current to separate regardless of the value of β^. It is also found that in the inertial limit (small Mu, large Re) the flow region to the east of the primary boundary current is dominated by strong wave interactions and large eddies which form as a result of shear instabilities. In an interesting case of the inertial limit, strong waves were found to interact with the separation region, causing it to expand and propagate to the east as a large eddy. This idealized the mechanism by which western boundary currents such as the Gulf Stream generate eddies in the world's oceans.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Design, Simulation and Fabrication of Photonic Crystal Slab Waveguide Based Polarization Processors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bayat, Khadijeh</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The Photonic Crystal (PC) is a potential candidate for a compact optical integrated circuit on a solid state platform. The fabrication process of a PC is compatible with CMOS technology; thus, it could be potentially employed in hybrid optical and electrical integrated circuits. One of the main obstacles in the implementation of an integrated optical circuit is the polarization dependence of wave propagation. Our goal is to overcome this obstacle by implementing PC based polarization controlling devices. One of the crucial elements of polarization controlling devices is the polarization rotator. The polarization rotator is utilized to manipulate and rotate the polarization of light. In this thesis, we have proposed, designed and implemented an ultra-compact passive PC based polarization rotator. Passive polarization rotator structures are mostly composed of geometrically asymmetric structures. The polarization rotator structure consists of a single defect line PC slab waveguide. The geometrical asymmetry has been introduced on top of the defect line as an asymmetric loaded layer. The top loaded layer is asymmetric with respect to the z-axis propagation direction. To synchronize the power conversion and avoid power conversion reversal, the top loaded layer is alternated around the z-axis periodically. The structure is called periodic asymmetric loaded PC slab waveguide. Due to the compactness of the proposed structure, a rigorous numerical method, 3D-FDTD can be employed to analyze and simulate the final designed structure. For the quick preliminary design, an analytical method that provides good approximate values of the structural parameters is preferred. Coupled-mode theory is a robust and well-known method for such analyses of perturbed waveguide structures. Thus, a coupled-mode theory based on semi-vectorial modes was developed for propagation modeling on square hole PC structures. In essence, we wish to develop a simple yet closed form method to carry out the initial design of the device of interest. In the next step, we refined the design by using rigorous but numerically expensive 3D-FDTD simulations. We believe this approach leads to optimization of the device parameters easily, if desired. To extend the design to a more general shape PC based polarization rotator, a design methodology based on hybrid modes of asymmetric loaded PC slab waveguide was introduced. The hybrid modes of the structure were calculated utilizing the 3D-FDTD method combined with the Spatial Fourier Transform (SFT). The propagation constants and profile of the slow and fast modes of an asymmetric loaded PC slab waveguide were extracted from the 3D-FDTD simulation results. The half-beat length, which is the length of each loaded layer, and total number of the loaded layers are calculated using the aforementioned data. This method provides the exact values of the polarization rotator structure’s parameter. The square hole PC based polarization rotator was designed employing both coupled-mode theory and normal modal analysis for THz frequency applications. Both design methods led to the same results. The design was verified by the 3D-FDTD simulation of the polarization rotator structure. For a square hole PC polarization rotator, a polarization conversion efficiency higher than 90% over the propagation distance of 12 λ was achieved within the frequency band of 586.4-604.5 GHz corresponding to the normalized frequency of 0.258-0.267. The design was extended to a circular hole PC based polarization rotator. A polarization conversion efficiency higher than 75% was achieved within the frequency band of 600-604.5 GHz. The circular hole PC polarization rotator is more compact than the square-hole PC structure. On the other hand, the circular hole PC polarization rotator is narrow band in comparison with the square hole PC polarization rotator. In a circular hole PC slab structure, the Bloch modes (fast and slow modes) couple energy to the TM-like PC slab modes. In both square and circular hole PC slab structures with finite number of rows, and the TM-like PC slab modes are extended to the lower edge of the bandgap. In bandgap calculation using PWEM, it is assumed that the PC structure is extended to infinity, however in practice the number of rows is limited, which is the source of discrepancy between the bandgap calculation using PWEM and 3D-FDTD. In an asymmetric loaded circular hole PC slab waveguide, the leaky TM-like PC slab modes are extended deep inside the bandgap and overlapped with both the slow and fast Bloch modes; whereas, in an asymmetric loaded square hole PC slab waveguide, the leaky TM-like PC slab modes are below the frequency band of slow and fast modes. Therefore, TM-like PC slab modes have significantly more adverse effect on the performance of the circular-hole based polarization rotator leading to a narrow band structure. SOI based PC membrane technology for THz application was developed. The device layer is made of highly resistive silicon to maintain low loss propagation for THz wave. The PC slab waveguide and polarization rotators were fabricated employing this technology. Finally, an a-SiON PC slab waveguide structures were also fabricated at low temperature for optical applications. This technology has the potential to be implemented on any substrate or CMOS chips.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Cylindrical colloids on a fluid membrane</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mkrtchyan, Sergey</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We theoretically study the adhesion and membrane-mediated interaction of cylindrical colloids to a flat fluid membrane. There are two ways to approach this problem. The first way, based on energy, requires finding the equilibrium shape of the membrane given the placement of the particle(s). In order to do so, we need to know how the energy of the surface depends on its shape (i.e. the surface Hamiltonian), as well as how the adhered colloid deforms the membrane. The second way to approach this class of problems is “geometrical”, where forces between the membrane-adhered particles are related directly to the geometry of the deformed membrane via the surface stress tensor. The surface Hamiltonian allows finding the stress at any point on the membrane in terms of local geometry. The force acting on the colloid can then be found by integrating this surface stress tensor along any contour enclosing the colloid. In this thesis, using the approach based on free energy calculations, we look into the problem of cylindrical colloids adhering to a membrane with fixed constant adhesion energy between the membrane and the colloids. Angle-arclength parameterization is used in order to treat the problem beyond small gradient approximation. We present three different cases here: single cylinder adhering on a membrane, two cylinders adhering on the same side of the membrane, and two cylinders adhering on different sides of the membrane. For the single cylinder case we present a structural phase diagram to separate no wrapping, partial wrapping and closure states and we compare it to the phase diagram obtained for a related system of spherical colloids. For two cylinders adhered on the same side of the membrane we obtain repulsive interaction and transition from shallow to deep wrapping as the cylinders move apart from each other. We also look into a phase where two cylinders are vertically stacked and discuss its energetics. For two cylinders adhering to the opposite sides of the membrane, attractive interaction is obtained in accordance with previous results and we further show that in that case two cylinders are generally in contact and a first-order transition from shallow to full wrapping is possible. In the last section, we put a framework for the class of problems where the particle is between the membrane and the supporting interface, where adhesion is assumed between the interface and the membrane.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Gauge-string duality has provided a powerful framework for the study of strongly coupled gauge theories and non-perturbative string models. This thesis analyzes the holographic description of non-local gauge theory operators and some aspects of the Bagger-Lambert theory. The latter, as a proposal for a multiple M2-branes effective theory, is conjectured to be the holographic dual of a compactification of M-theory. We show that all half-BPS Wilson loop operators in N=4 SYM - which are labeled by Young tableaus - have a gravitational dual description in terms of D5-branes or alternatively in terms of D3-branes in AdS5xS5. We prove that the insertion of a half-BPS Wilson loop operator in the N=4 SYM path integral is achieved by integrating out the degrees of freedom on a configuration of bulk D5-branes or alternatively on a configuration of bulk D3-branes. We construct a new class of supersymmetric surface operators in N=4 SYM and find the corresponding dual supergravity solutions. Consistency requires constructing N=4 SYM in the D7 supergravity background and not in flat space. This enlarges the class of holographic gauge theories dual to string theory backgrounds to gauge theories in non-trivial supergravity backgrounds. We write down a maximally supersymmetric one parameter deformation of the field theory action of Bagger and Lambert and we show that this theory on RxT2 is invariant under the superalgebra of the maximally supersymmetric Type IIB plane wave. It is argued that this theory holographically describes the Type IIB plane wave in the discrete light-cone quantization (DLCQ). Finally, we show by explicit computation that the Bagger-Lambert Lagrangian realizes the M2-brane superalgebra, including also two p-form central charges that encode the M-theory intersections involving M2-branes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Effect of Time-Varying Boundary Conditions on the Generation of Sum and Difference Frequency Tones in a Coaxial Loudspeaker</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Dupont, Edward</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A coaxial loudspeaker in which the woofer and tweeter oscillate at angular frequencies ω_1 and ω_2 respectively, is known to produce sum and difference frequencies ω_± = ω_1 ± ω_2. The generation of these can be attributed to both the nonlinearity of the equations of motion and the Lagrangian boundary behaviour of the low-frequency transducer. In order to characterize the phenomena of interest a perturbation expansion of the field variables is introduced (sometimes called quasi-linear approximation). After deriving a second-order equation for pressure, from which the intermodulation frequencies are obtained, an attempt is made to justify the dominance of the boundary mechanism over that of the fluid nonlinearity. An exact integral solution is then given for the spatial factor of the ω_± pressure terms. In the special case of a farfield on-axis observer an analytic solution is obtained. Several numerical investigations are performed and compared with experiment.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Terahertz Surface Plasmon Polariton-like Surface Waves for Sensing Applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Arbabi, Amir</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Surface plasmon polaritons are electromagnetic surface waves coupled to electron plasma oscillation of metals at a metal-dielectric interface. At optical frequencies, these modes are of great interest because of their high confinement to a metal-dielectric interface. Due to the field enhancement at the interface, they have been used in different applications such as sensors, second harmonic generation and enhanced Raman scattering. Surface plasmon resonance based sensors are being used for detection of molecular adsorption such as DNA and proteins. These sensors are known to be highly sensitive and have successfully become commercialized. Terahertz (THz) frequency band of electromagnetic spectrum has attracted researchers in the last few years mostly because of sensing and imaging applications. Many important chemical and biological molecules have their vibrational and rotational resonance frequencies in the THz range that makes the THz sensing one of the most important applications of THz technology. Considering above mentioned facts, extending the concept of surface plasmon sensors to THz frequencies can result in sensitive sensors. In this work the possibility of this extension has been investigated. After reviewing optical surface plasmon polariton waves and a basic sensor configuration, surface plasmon polariton waves propagating on at metallic and doped semiconductor surfaces have been examined for this purpose. It has been shown that these waves on metallic surfaces are loosely confined to the metal-dielectric interface and doped semiconductors are also too lossy and cannot meet the requirements for sensing applications. Afterwards, it is shown that periodically patterned metallic surfaces can guide surface waves that resemble surface plasmon polariton waves. A periodically patterned metallic surface is used to guide THz surface plasmon polariton-like surface waves and a highly sensitive sensor is proposed based on that. The quasi-optical continuous wave (CW) THz radiation is coupled to this structure using the Otto's attenuated total reflection (ATR) configuration and the sensitivity of the device is discussed. A general scattering parameter based model for prism coupling has been proposed and verified. It is shown that a critical coupling condition can happen by changing the gap size between the prim and periodic surface. Details of fabrication of the periodic structure and experimental setup have also been presented.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Differential Geometry of Instantons</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Smith, Benjamin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The instanton solutions to the Yang-Mills equations have a vast range of practical applications in field theories including gravitation and electro-magnetism. Solutions to Maxwell's equations, for example, are abelian gauge instantons on Minkowski space. Since these discoveries, a generalised theory of instantons has been emerging for manifolds with special holonomy. Beginning with connections and curvature on complex vector bundles, this thesis provides some of the essential background for studying moduli spaces of instantons. Manifolds with exceptional holonomy are special types of seven and eight dimensional manifolds whose holonomy group is contained in G2 and Spin(7), respectively. Focusing on the G2 case, instantons on G2 manifolds are defined to be solutions to an analogue of the four dimensional anti-self-dual equations. These connections are known as Donaldson-Thomas connections and a couple of examples are noted.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Sensitivity Enhancement of Near Field Probes Using Negative Materials</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Boybay, Muhammed Said</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the last decade, design and application of negative materials have been one of the most interesting subjects in the electromagnetic research. The extraordinary properties of double negative (DNG) and single negative (SNG) materials have been studied extensively over this period. In this thesis, one of the unusual properties of negative materials, the evanescent amplification, is used to improve the sensitivity of the near field probes. The effect of placing DNG and SNG layers between the near field probes and the targets are investigated theoretically. A sensitivity definition is introduced for evanescent probes and it is shown using quantitative measures that the sensitivity can be increased using DNG and SNG materials for a target in vacuum and for a buried target. The electromagnetic loss of the negative materials and the mismatch between the material properties of the host medium and DNG and SNG materials are studied. Using an unmatched DNG layer or SNG layer enhances the sensitivity within an evanescent spectrum range while a lossless and matched DNG layer improves the sensitivity of entire evanescent spectrum. The idea of using negative materials is implemented over conventional near field probes by numerical experiments. Sensitivities of open-ended waveguides and open-ended coaxial lines for a specific application are studied in the presence of negative materials. In the case of precursor pitting detection on airplane bodies, the sensitivity of an open-ended waveguide probe is increased by 35 times for a λ/10 sized cubic crack. It is also shown that the negative material increases the quality of the image generated by the probe. The sensitivity improvement is also verified for an open-ended coaxial line. A 11 times improvement is achieved for a similar detection practice, with a λ/20 sized crack. The effect of coaxial line size and the dielectric material on the sensitivity enhancement are studied. The improvement is studied theoretically and numerically for an electrically small dipole. Theoretical studies show that when a small dipole is placed within a spherical shell made of DNG materials, the antenna parameters of the dipole becomes more sensitive to the position of a target placed outside the negative material shell. The field distribution generated by a small dipole in a multilayered spherical medium is studied for this purpose. Numerical analysis of a small dipole placed next to a planar DNG layer is presented. The DNG layer increases the sensitivity of the dipole due to a λ/30 sized metallic target by 5.5 times. To provide experimental verification, the sensitivity of an electrically small loop is studied. SNG materials with a negative permeability around 1.25 GHz are designed using modified split ring resonators (MSRR). By using the effective parameters of the designed structure, a sensitivity improvement of 10 times is achieved numerically. The improvement is verified using fabricated MSRR structures. The sensitivity of the small loop is enhanced by 9 times for a λ/12.2 sized metallic target. The sensitivity improvements are achieved within the frequency band where the MSRR structures behave as a μ-negative SNG material.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Comparative Study and Analysis of THz Pulse and Continuous-wave Imaging towards Medical Application</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Davoudi, Bahar</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Until recently, there had been a gap between the output frequencies of electronic and optical sources, which included waves of frequencies around 300 GHz to 3 THz and was known as the Terahertz gap. After the development of sources and detectors that operated at these frequencies, Terahertz radiation began to find its way through a variety of applications such as surveillance, spectroscopy and medical imaging. Terahertz radiation has been used in medical imaging experiments on different in-vitro and some in-vivo biological tissues and has shown promising results in differentiating certain features in those tissues. Moreover, it has demonstrated well in detecting certain polar molecules due to these molecules’ fingerprint in Terahertz range of frequencies. Considering these facts, Terahertz has been proved to have the potential for being a perspective medical imaging method, which can be used as a complement to other imaging techniques such as MRI or X-ray or even as a separate method. Due to the capacity of Terahertz radiation, much research is being done on using Terahertz generation-detection set-ups for medical imaging and improving the imaging parameters of these set-ups to capture more precise and meaningful images. In this thesis, the imaging parameters of two different THz imaging set-ups have been studied and compared. One of these imaging set-ups is a THz pulse set-up with photoconductive dipole antennas as source and detector and the other one is a continuous-wave set-up with a backward wave oscillator as the source and a Golay cell as the detector. To the best of our knowledge, a comparative analysis of the imaging parameters of these two types of THz imaging set-ups has not been performed previously. In this thesis, parameters such as modulation transfer function (MTF), resolution and beam profile have been measured through the experiments, for both the THz pulse and THz CW imaging set-ups. These results are compared to the results obtained by theoretical formulas and the reason for any differences occurred between these two results has been explained. Moreover, the imaging parameters found from the experiments for the two set-ups have been compared together and similarities and differences have been discussed. In this thesis, a set of experiments has also been done to verify the capability of the two imaging set-ups for in-vitro tooth imaging, towards developing THz imaging systems suitable for clinical imaging application. These experiments have been performed on a tooth crown sample with the pulse set-up and on a tooth cross-section sample with the continuous-wave set-up. The capability of our THz pulse imaging system to distinguish thickness variations in a tooth crown sample by time-of-flight imaging has been shown and discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Reference Frames and Algorithms for Quantum Information Processing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sheridan, Lana</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The main results of this thesis fall in to two areas, ﬁrstly quantum reference frames as a resource for quantum computations and secondly quantum algorithms. The results relating to quantum references consider their scaling with a requirements to perform measurements, operations and computations with a certain ﬁdelity. For the case of a directional frame, the central question considered is of how many operations or measurements can be performed with it before its ﬁdelity falls below some threshold. This is found to scale as the square of the size of the reference frame under for a range of physically interesting cases. To prove that result a new general form for any rotationally invariant map. This could have many applications is comparing and classifying rotationally invariant behaviour of quantum systems. Phase references are also considered for the case of performing quantum computations under an energy conservation law. The restriction that the expected energy be conserved for large quantum computations is shown to be manageable in many diﬀerent potential architectures. In the case of completing computations is an energy conserving subspace, the requirements for ancillas are sublinear in the number of qubits, and even in a circuit model implementation, the errors due to phase reference imperfections are shown to not limit the apparent algorithmic improvements of quantum computing over classical computing. A quantum walk for the novel concept of two entangled walkers is proposed and analyzed. A modest improvement is found in the scaling of the expected separation of the walkers over the separable case. It illustrates the potential for making use of particle statistic behaviour in algorithms. Lastly, the relation between discrete and continuous time models of quantum computing is explored through the analysis of a new algorithm for simulating the Hamiltonian behaviour of a black box unitary operation. The scaling of the number of calls to the unitary required to obtain a simulation correct to within a parameter ϵ is found, as is a case where the eﬃciency of the algorithm is superior to directly applying the unitary repeatedly. Applications of the algorithm are considered.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electromagnetic Wave Transmission through Sub-wavelength Channels and Bends Using Metallic Wires</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kashanianfard, Mani</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Techniques and technologies to transfer electromagnetic energy through sub-wavelength channels have been researched extensively in the past few years because their application in different areas such as sub-wavelength imaging, telecommunication, increasing the storage capacity, and confinement and transmission of electromagnetic energy. Common ways of achieving such transmission includes exciting surface plasmon polaritons on both sides of the cannel or using double negative metamaterials. Recently a mechanism to squeeze the electromagnetic energy through sub-wavelength channels using materials with extremely small permittivity was introduced. Such materials may be found naturally at some limited frequencies in the infrared and optical frequency ranges, but they are commonly fabricated for a desired frequency as engineered metamaterials by by embedding metallic inclusions in a dielectric medium. The main problem with the engineered materials is that they have relatively large losses at their low permittivity frequency. In this thesis,I have presented a novel structure consisting of arrays of metallic wires that can be used to squeeze electromagnetic energy through sub-wavelength channels and junctions with negligible loss. The theory of transmission through such array is derived and design methods to tune the transmission frequency is provided. The structure is also tested numerically and experimentally in several geometries and results are compared with previous methods.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Holographic Experiments on Defects</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wapler, Matthias Christian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study the anisotropic transport properties of both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric matter fields on (2+1)-dimensional defects coupled to a (3+1)-dimensional N=4 SYM "heat bath". We address on the one hand the purely conformal defect where the only non-vanishing background field that we turn on is a "topological", parameter parametrizing the impact on the bulk. On the other hand we also address the case of a finite external background magnetic field, finite net charge density and finite mass. We find in the purely conformal limit that the system possesses a conduction threshold given by the wave number of the perturbation and that the charge transport arises from a quasiparticle spectrum which is consistent with an intuitive picture where the defect acquires a finite width in the direction of the SYM bulk. We also examine finite-coupling modifications arising from higher derivative interactions in the probe brane action. In the case of finite density, mass and magnetic field, our results generalize the conformal case. We discover at high frequencies a spectrum of quasiparticle resonances due to the magnetic field and finite density and at small frequencies a Drude-like expansion around the DC limit. Both of these regimes display many generic features and some features that we attribute to strong coupling, such as a minimum DC conductivity and an unusual behavior of the "cyclotron" and plasmon frequencies, which become correlated to the resonances found in the conformal case. We further study the hydrodynamic regime and the relaxation properties, in which the system displays a set of different possible transitions to the collisionless regime. The mass dependence can be cast in two regimes: a generic relativistic behavior dominated by the UV and a non-linear hydrodynamic behavior dominated by the IR. In the massless case, we also extend earlier results to find an interesting duality under the transformation of the conductivity and the exchange of density and magnetic field. Furthermore, we look at the thermodynamics and the phase diagram, which reproduces general features found earlier in 3+1 dimensional systems and demonstrates stability in the relevant phase.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantum Microwave Photodetection Using Superconducting Josephson Circuits.</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Osberg, Brendan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Superconducting circuits have recently become a major contender for the implementation of quantum computers owing to their compatibility with existing microchip fabrication technologies. Their utility stems largely from their ability to be coupled with resonant cavities for the purposes of trapping and relaying microwave radiation. Because of this feature, scientists are able to transmit quantum information from a variety of qubits. Though quantum-limited amplifiers exist, unfortunately there currently exists no microwave photon counter capable of single shot quantum detection. Hence, we use superconducting circuits with Josephson junctions to design a microwave photon detector based on a modified phase qubit that exhibits a bandwidth of 4GHz, and a detection fidelity of 98%. We use metastable barrier transition (driven by incident photons) to create an avalanche effect analogous to current photo-diodes. Linear coupling of the junction flux with the radiation permits photodetection from an arbitrary quantum source in the GHz range. We show the device to be robust to changes in drive frequency, temporal photon width, and resonator quality factor, and we optimize our device with respect to these parameters. We show the device to be stable over the necessary time scales, and yet sensitive enough to accurately measure photons on demand.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Surface Code Threshold Calculation and Flux Qubit Coupling</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Groszkowski, Peter</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Building a quantum computer is a formidable challenge. In this thesis, we focus on two projects, which tackle very different aspects of quantum computation, and yet still share a common goal in hopefully getting us closer to implementing a quantum computer on a large scale. The first project involves a numerical error threshold calculation of a quantum error correcting code called a surface code. These are local check codes, which means that only nearest neighbour interaction is required to determine where errors occurred. This is an important advantage over other approaches, as in many physical systems, doing operations on arbitrarily spaced qubits is often very difficult. An error threshold is a measure of how well a given error correcting scheme performs. It gives the experimentalists an idea of which approaches to error correction hold greater promise. We simulate both toric and planar variations of a surface code, and numerically calculate a threshold value of approximately $6.0 \times 10^{-3}$, which is comparable to similar calculations done by others \cite{Raussendorf2006,Raussendorf2007,Wang2009}. The second project deals with coupling superconducting flux qubits together. It expands the scheme presented in \cite{Plourde2004} to a three qubit, two coupler scenario. We study L-shaped and line-shaped coupler geometries, and show how the coupling strength changes in terms of the dimensions of the couplers. We explore two cases, the first where the interaction energy between two nearest neighbour qubits is high, while the coupling to the third qubit is as negligible as possible, as well as a case where all the coupling energies are as small as possible. Although only an initial step, a similar scheme can in principle be extended further to implement a lattice required for computation on a surface code.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Chirped-pulse interferometry: Classical dispersion cancellation and analogues of two-photon quantum interference</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lavoie, Jonathan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Interference has long been used for precision measurement of path-length changes. Since the advent of the laser, interference has become one of the most versatile tools in metrology. Specifically, ultra-short laser pulses allow unprecedented resolution in absolute length measurements. While ultra-short laser pulses lead to high resolution, for example in white-light interferometry, they are very susceptible to dispersion. Quantum resources have been proposed to overcome some of the problems related to distortions in the interferometric signal. For example, the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer relies on frequency-entangled photon pairs and features automatic even-order dispersion cancellation and high interference visibility resilient to unbalanced loss. Quantum-OCT is a technique based on HOM interferometry, that promises to overcome Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) a classical imaging technique based on low coherence light. Furthermore, straightforward modifications of the HOM interferometer can display several different interferometric signals, including the HOM peak, quantum beating, and phase super-resolution. However, the quantum resources required are hard to produce and dim, leading to long integration times and single-photon counting. In this thesis, we introduce the theory behind Chirped-Pulse Interferometry (CPI), a new technique that combines all the advantages of Q-OCT, including even-order dispersion cancellation, but without the need for any quantum resources. We then experimentally implement CPI and demonstrate all the important characteristics shared by the HOM interferometer, but at dramatically larger signal levels. We show how CPI can be used to measure dispersion cancelled axial profiles of an optical sample and show the improvement in resolution over white-light interferometry. Finally, we show that by modifying CPI in analogous ways to HOM, CPI can also be made to produce interferometric signal identical to the HOM peak, quantum beating, and phase super-resolution.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Multi-scale Stochastic Filter Based Approach to Inverse Scattering for 3D Ultrasound Soft Tissue Characterization</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tsui, Patrick Pak Chuen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The goal of this research is to achieve accurate characterization of multi-layered soft tissues in three dimensions using focused ultrasound. The characterization of the acoustic parameters of each tissue layer is formulated as recursive processes of forward- and inverse- scattering. Forward scattering deals with the modeling of focused ultrasound wave propagation in multi-layered tissues, and the computation of the focused wave amplitudes in the tissues based on the acoustic parameters of the tissue as generated by inverse scattering. The model for mapping the tissue acoustic parameters to focused waves is highly nonlinear and stochastic. In addition, solving (or inverting) the model to obtain tissue acoustic parameters is an ill-posed problem. Therefore, a nonlinear stochastic inverse scattering method is proposed such that no linearization and mathematical inversion of the model are required. Inverse scattering aims to estimate the tissue acoustic parameters based on the forward scattering model and ultrasound measurements of the tissues. A multi-scale stochastic filter (MSF) is proposed to perform inverse scattering. MSF generates a set of tissue acoustic parameters, which are then mapped into focused wave amplitudes in the multi-layered tissues by forward scattering. The tissue acoustic parameters are weighted by comparing their focused wave amplitudes to the actual ultrasound measurements. The weighted parameters are used to estimate a weighted Gaussian mixture as the posterior probability density function (PDF) of the parameters. This PDF is optimized to achieve minimum estimation error variance in the sense of the posterior Cramer-Rao bound. The optimized posterior PDF is used to produce minimum mean-square-error estimates of the tissue acoustic parameters. As a result, both the estimation error and uncertainty of the parameters are minimized. PDF optimization is formulated based on a novel multi-scale PDF analysis framework. This framework is founded based on exploiting the analogy between PDFs and analog (or digital) signals. PDFs and signals are similar in the sense that they represent characteristics of variables in their respective domains, except that there are constraints imposed on PDFs. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider a PDF as a signal that is subject to amplitude constraints, and as such apply signal processing techniques to analyze the PDF. The multi-scale PDF analysis framework is proposed to recursively decompose an arbitrary PDF from its fine to coarse scales. The recursive decompositions are designed so as to ensure that requirements such as PDF constraints, zero-phase shift and non-creation of artifacts are satisfied. The relationship between the PDFs at consecutive scales is derived in order for the PDF optimization process to recursively reconstruct the posterior PDF from its coarse to fine scales. At each scale, PDF reconstruction aims to reduce the variances of the posterior PDF Gaussian components, and as a result the confidence in the estimate is increased. The overall posterior PDF variance reduction is guided by the posterior Cramer-Rao bound. A series of experiments is conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed method on ultrasound multi-layered soft tissue characterization. Multi-layered tissue phantoms that emulate ocular components of the eye are fabricated as test subjects. Experimental results confirm that the proposed MSF inverse scattering approach is well suited for three-dimensional ultrasound tissue characterization. In addition, performance comparisons between MSF and a state-of-the-art nonlinear stochastic filter are conducted. Results show that MSF is more accurate and less computational intensive than the state-of-the-art filter.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Theory, Design and Development of Resonance Based Biosensors in Terahertz and Millimeter-wave</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Neshat, Mohammad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Recent advances in molecular biology and nanotechnology have enabled scientists to study biological systems at molecular and atomic scales. This level of sophistication demands for new technologies to emerge for providing the necessary sensing tools and equipment. Recent studies have shown that terahertz technology can provide revolutionary sensing techniques for organic and non-organic materials with unprecedented accuracy and sensitivity. This is due to the fact that most of the macromolecules have vibrational and/or rotational resonance signatures in terahertz range. To further increase the sensitivity, terahertz radiation is generated and interacted with the bio-sample on a miniaturized test site or the so-called biochip. From the view point of generation and manipulation of terahertz radiation, the biochip is designed based on the same rules as in high frequency electronic chips or integrated circuits (IC). By increasing the frequency toward terahertz range, the conventional IC design methodologies and analysis tools fail to perform accurately. Therefore, development of new design methodologies and analysis tools is of paramount importance for future terahertz integrated circuits (TIC) in general and terahertz biochips in particular. In this thesis, several advancements are made in design methodology, analysis tool and architecture of terahertz and millimeter-wave integrated circuits when used as a biochip. A global and geometry independent approach for design and analysis of the travelling-wave terahertz photomixer sources, as the core component in a TIC, is discussed in details. Three solvers based on photonic, semiconductor and electromagnetic theories are developed and combined as a unified analysis tool. Using the developed terahertz photomixer source, a resonance-based biochip structure is proposed, and its operation principle, based on resonance perturbation method, is explained. A planar metallic resonator acting as a sample holder and transducer is designed, and its performance in terms of sensitivity and selectivity is studied through simulations. The concept of surface impedance for electromagnetic modeling of DNA self-assembled monolayer on a metal surface is proposed, and its effectiveness is discussed based on the available data in the literature. To overcome the loss challenge, Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) dielectric resonators with high Q factor are studied as an alternative for metallic resonator. The metallic loss becomes very high at terahertz frequencies, and as a result of that planar metallic resonators do not exhibit high Q factor. Reduced Q factor results in a low sensitivity for any sensor using such resonators. Theoretical models for axially and radially layered dielectric resonators acting on WGM are presented, and the analytical results are compared with the measured data. Excitation of WGM through dielectric waveguide is proposed, and the critical coupling condition is explained through analytical formulation. The possibility of selecting one resonance among many for sensing application is also studied both theoretically and experimentally. A high sensitivity sensor based on WGM resonance in mm-wave and terahertz is proposed, and its sensitivity is studied in details. The performance of the proposed sensor is tested for sensing drug tablets and also liquid droplets through various measurements in mm-wave range. The comprehensive sensitivity analysis shows the ability of the proposed sensor to detect small changes in the order of 10−4 in the sample dielectric constant. The results of various experiments carried out on drug tablets are reported to demonstrate the potential multifunctional capabilities of the sensor in moisture sensing, counterfeit drug detection, and contamination screening. The measurement and simulation results obtained in mm-wave hold promise for WGM to be used for sensing biological solutions in terahertz range with very high sensitivity.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Theoretical studies of frustrated magnets with dipolar interactions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Stasiak, Pawel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Several magnetic materials, in the first approximation, can be described by idealised theoretical models, such as classical Ising or Heisenberg spin systems, and, to some extent, such models are able to qualitatively expose many experimentally observed phenomena. But often, to account for complex behavior of magnetic matter, such models have to be refined by including more terms in Hamiltonian. The compound LiHo_xY_{1-x}F_4, by increasing concentration of nonmagnetic yttrium can be tuned from a diluted ferromagnet to a spin glass. LiHoF_4 is a good realisation of the transverse field Ising model, the simplest model exhibiting a quantum phase transition. In the pure case the magnetic behaviour of this material is well described by mean-field theory. It was believed that when diluted, LiHo_xY_{1-x}F_4 would also manifest itself as a diluted transverse field Ising model which continue to be well described by mean-field theory, and, at sufficient dilution, at zero temperature, exhibit a quantum spin-glass transition. The experimental data did not support such a scenario, and it was pointed out that, to explain physics of LiHo_xY_{1-x}F_4 in transverse magnetic field, the effect of a transverse-field-generated longitudinal random field has to be considered. We explore this idea further in local mean-field studies in which all three parameters: temperature, transverse field and concentration can be consistently surveyed, and where the transverse-field-generated longitudinal random field is explicitly present in the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian. We suggest other materials that are possible candidates for studying quantum criticality in the transverse field Ising model, and in the diluted case, for studying the effects of transverse and longitudinal random fields. The compounds we consider are RE(OH)_3, where RE are the rare earth ions Tb^{3+}, Dy^{3+} and Ho^{3+}. Using mean-field theory, we estimate the values of the transverse magnetic field that, at zero temperature, destroy ferromagnetic order to be B_x^c=4.35 T, B_x^c=5.03 T and B_x^c=54.81 T for Ho(OH)_3, Dy(OH)_3 and Tb(OH)_3, respectively. We confirm that Ho(OH)_3 and Tb(OH)_3, similarly to LiHoF_4, can be described by an effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian. In the case of Dy(OH)_3 there is a possibility of a first order phase transition at transverse field close to B_x^c, and Dy(OH)_3 cannot be described by a spin-1/2 effective Hamiltonian. While diluted dipolar Ising spin glass has been studied experimentally in LiHo_xY_{1-x}F_4 and in numerical simulations, there are no studies of the Heisenberg case. Example materials that are likely candidates to be realisations of the diluted dipolar Heisenberg spin glass are (Gd_xY_{1-x})_2Ti_2O_7, (Gd_xY_{1-x})_2Sn_2O_7 and (Gd_xY_{1-x})_3Ga_5O_{12}. To stimulate interest in experimental studies of these systems we present results of Monte of Carlo simulations of the diluted dipolar Heisenberg spin glass. By performing finite-size scaling analysis of the spin-glass correlation length and the spin-glass susceptibility, we provide a compelling evidence of a thermodynamical spin-glass transition in the model. Frustrated pyrochlore magnets, depending on the character of single ion anisotropy and interplay of different types of interaction over a broad range of energy scales, exhibit a large spectrum of exotic phases and novel phenomena. The pyrochlore antiferromagnet Er_2Ti_2O_7 is characterised by a strong planar anisotropy. Experimental studies reveal that Er_2Ti_2O_7 undergoes a continuous phase transition to a long-range ordered phase with a spin configuration that, in this thesis, is referred to as the Champion-Holdsworth state. Such results are not in agreement with the theoretical prediction that the ground state of the pyrochlore easy-plane antiferromagnet with dipolar interactions complementing the nearest neighbour exchange interactions, is not the Champion-Holdsworth state but the so-called Palmer-Chalker state. On the other hand, Monte Carlo simulations of the easy-plane pyrochlore antiferromagnet indicate a thermal order-by-disorder selection of the Champion-Holdsworth state. To answer the question of whether order-by-disorder selection can be the mechanism at play in Er_2Ti_2O_7, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of the easy-plane pyrochlore antiferromagnet with weak dipolar interactions. We estimate the range strengths of the dipolar interaction such that order-by-disorder selection of the Champion-Holdsworth state is not suppressed. The estimated value of the allowed strength of the dipolar interactions indicates that the model studied is likely insufficient to explain the physics of Er_2Ti_2O_7 and other types of interactions or quantum effects should be considered.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The evaluation of bulbar redness grading scales</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Schulze, Marc-Matthias</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The use of grading scales is common in clinical practice and research settings. A number of grading scales are available to the practitioner, however, despite their frequent use, they are only poorly understood and may be criticised for a number of things such as the variability of the assessments or the inequality of scale steps within or between scales. Hence, the global aim of this thesis was to study the McMonnies/Chapman-Davies (MC-D), Institute for Eye Research (IER), Efron, and validated bulbar redness (VBR) grading scales in order to (1) get a better understanding and (2) attempt a cross-calibration of the scales. After verifying the accuracy and precision of the objective and subjective techniques to be used (chapter 3), a series of experiments was conducted. The specific aims of this thesis were as follows: • Chapter 4: To use physical attributes of redness to determine the accuracy of the four bulbar redness grading scales. • Chapter 5: To use psychophysical scaling to estimate the perceived redness of the four bulbar redness grading scales. • Chapter 6: To investigate the effect of using reference anchors when scaling the grading scale images, and to convert grades between scales. • Chapter 7: To grade bulbar redness using cross-calibrated versions of the MC-D, IER, Efron, and VBR grading scales. Methods: • Chapter 4: Two image processing metrics, fractal dimension (D) and % pixel coverage (% PC), as well as photometric chromaticity (u’) were selected as physical measures to describe and compare redness in the four bulbar redness grading scales. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between each set of image metrics and the reference image grades to determine the accuracy of the scales. • Chapter 5: Ten naïve observers were asked to arrange printed copies of modified versions of the reference images (showing vascular detail only) across a distance of 1.5m for which only start and end point were indicated by 0 and 100, respectively (non-anchored scaling). After completion of scaling, the position of each image was hypothesised to reflect its perceived bulbar redness. The averaged perceived redness (across observers) for each image was used for comparison to the physical attributes of redness as determined in chapter 4. • Chapter 6: The experimental setup from chapter 5 was modified by providing the reference images of the VBR scale as additional, unlabelled anchors for psychophysical scaling (anchored scaling). Averaged perceived redness from anchored scaling was compared to non-anchored scaling, and perceived redness from anchored scaling was used to cross-calibrate grades between scales. • Chapter 7: The modified reference images of each grading scale were positioned within the 0 to 100 range according to their averaged perceived redness from anchored scaling, one scale at a time. The same 10 observers who had participated in the scaling experiments were asked to represent perceived bulbar redness of 16 sample images by placing them, one at a time, relative to the reference images of each scale. Perceived redness was taken as the measured position of the placed image from 0 and was averaged across observers. Results: • Chapter 4: Correlations were high between reference image grades and all sets of objective metrics (all Pearson’s r’s≥0.88, p≤0.05); each physical attribute pointed to a different scale as being most accurate. Independent of the physical attribute used, there were wide discrepancies between scale grades, with sometimes little overlap of equivalent levels when comparing the scales. • Chapter 5: The perceived redness of the reference images within each scale was ordered as expected, but not all consecutive within-scale levels were rated as having different redness. Perceived redness of the reference images varied between scales, with different ranges of severity being covered by the images. The perceived redness was strongly associated with the physical attributes of the reference images. • Chapter 6: There were differences in perceived redness range and when comparing reference levels between scales. Anchored scaling resulted in an apparent shift to lower perceived redness for all but one reference image compared to non-anchored scaling, with the rank order of the 20 images for both procedures remaining fairly constant (Spearman’s ρ=0.99). • Chapter 7: Overall, perceived redness depended on the sample image and the reference scale used (RM ANOVA; p=0.0008); 6 of the 16 images had a perceived redness that was significantly different between at least two of the scales. Between-scale correlation coefficients of concordance (CCC) ranged from 0.93 (IER vs. Efron) to 0.98 (VBR vs. Efron). Between-scale coefficients of repeatability (COR) ranged from 5 units (IER vs. VBR) to 8 units (IER vs. Efron) for the 0 to 100 range. Conclusions: • Chapter 4: Despite the generally strong linear associations between the physical characteristics of reference images in each scale, the scales themselves are not inherently accurate and are too different to allow for cross-calibration based on physical redness attributes. • Chapter 5: Subjective estimates of redness are based on a combination of chromaticity and vessel-based components. Psychophysical scaling of perceived redness lends itself to being used to cross calibrate the four clinical scales. • Chapter 6: The re-scaling of the reference images with anchored scaling suggests that redness was assessed based on within-scale characteristics and not using absolute redness scores, a mechanism that may be referred to as clinical scale constancy. The perceived redness data allow practitioners to modify the grades of the scale they commonly use so that comparisons of grading estimates between calibrated scales may be made. • Chapter 7: The use of the newly calibrated reference grades showed close agreement between grading estimates of all scales. The between-scale variability was similar to the variability typically observed when a single scale is repeatedly used. Perceived redness appears to be dependent upon the dynamic range of the reference images of the scale. In conclusion, this research showed that there are physical and perceptual differences between the reference images of all scales. A cross-calibration of the scales based on the perceived redness of the reference images provides practitioners with an opportunity to compare grades across scales, which is of particular value in research settings or if the same patient is seen by multiple practitioners who are familiar with using different scales.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Ray Optics Framework for the Computation of The Sieve Effect Factor for Blood</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Northam, Lesley</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Light may traverse a turbid material, such as blood, without encountering any of its pigment particles, a phenomenon known as sieve effect. This phenomenon may result in a decrease in the amount of light absorbed by the material. Accordingly, the corresponding sieve factor needs to be accounted for in optical investigations aimed at the derivation of blood biophysical properties from light transmittance measurements. The existing procedures used for its estimation either lack the flexibility required for practical applications or are based on general formulas that incorporate other light and matter interaction phenomena. In this thesis, a ray optics framework is proposed to estimate the sieve factor for blood samples using a first principles approach. It consists in applying ray-casting techniques to determine the probability that light can traverse a blood sample without encountering any of the pigment (hemoglobin) containing cells. The thickness of the samples as well as the distribution, orientation and shape of the red blood cells are taken into account by the simulation algorithm employed in this framework. The predictive capabilities of the proposed approach are demonstrated through a series of in silico experiments. Its effectiveness is further illustrated by visualizations depicting the different blood parameterizations considered in the simulations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantum Optoelectronic Detection and Mixing in the Nanowire Superconducting Structure</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yan, Zhizhong</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The recent advancement of superconducting nano devices has allowed for making a Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detector (SNSPD), whose extraordinary features have strongly motivated the research community to exploit it in many practical applications. In this thesis, an experimental setup for testing the SNSPD has been established. It contains an in-house packaging that meets the requirements of RF/microwave and optoelectronic characterizations. The quantum efficiency and detection efficiency measurements have confirmed that our approach is satisfactory. The dark count performance has reached the anticipated level. The factors affecting rise and fall times of the photoresponses are addressed. Based on the successful setup, the characterizations including dc, small signal ac measurements have been undertaken. The measurements are aimed at quantitatively investigating Cooper pair density in the superconducting nanowire. The experimental method involves a two-step, small signal S-parameter measurement either in the presence or absence of optical powers. The subsequent measurements by varying the temperature and dc bias current have achieved remarkable understanding on the physical properties of SNSPD nanowires. Then, the electrically induced nonlinearity is studied via the large signal RF and Microwave measurements. The experiments are a set of one-tone and two-tone measurements, in which either the RF driving power is varied at a fixed frequency, or vice versa. Two major nonlinear microwave circuit analysis methods, i.e. time-domain transient and hybrid-domain harmonic balance analysis, are employed. The simulation result reveals the optimized conditions of reaching the desired nonlinearity. Finally, we have successfully measured the optoelectronic mixing products in an electrically pumped optoelectronic mixer, which has identical structures as that of the SNSPD. The experiments confirm that this mixer is not only sensitive to the classical light intensities, but also to that of the single photon level. Meanwhile, the quantum conversion matrices is derived to interpret the quantum optoelectronic mixing effects.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental Investigation of the Effect of Wall Adaptation on Flow Over a Cylinder in a Modernized Adaptive-Wall Wind Tunnel</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bishop, Michael Joseph</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A renovation of an adaptive-wall wind tunnel was completed to improve flow quality, automate data acquisition, integrate a three-axis traversing mechanism, and regain functionality of an adaptive-wall test section. Redesign of the settling chamber significantly improved flow quality, with the resulting turbulence intensity of 0.3% and flow uniformity of ±0.6% matching characteristics of research-grade wind tunnels. The functionality of the adaptive-wall test section was tested by analyzing the effect of wall adaptation on flow development over a circular cylinder. Experiments were carried out for a Reynolds number (Red) of 57,000 for three blockage ratios: 5%, 8%, and 17%. Measurements were made in three wall configurations: geometrically straight walls (GSW), aerodynamically straight walls (ASW), and streamlined walls (SLW). Solid blockage effects were clearly evident in cylinder surface pressure distributions for the GSW and ASW configurations, manifested by an increased peak suction and base suction. Upon streamlining the walls, pressure distributions for each blockage ratio matched distributions expected for low blockage ratios. Wake blockage limited wake growth in the GSW configuration at 7.75 and 15 diameters downstream of the cylinder for blockages of 17% and 8%, respectively. This adverse effect was rectified by streamlining the walls with the resulting wake width development matching that expected for low blockage ratios. Wake vortex shedding frequency and shear layer instability frequency increased in the GSW and ASW configurations with increasing blockage ratio. Invariance of the near wake width with wall configuration suggests that frequency increase is caused by the increased velocity due to solid blockage effects. For all the blockage ratios investigated, the increased wake vortex shedding frequency observed in the ASW and GSW configurations was corrected in the SLW configuration, with the resulting Strouhal numbers of about 0.19, matching that expected for low blockage ratios at the investigated Red.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Investigation of an Inhomogeneous Mixing Model for Conditional Moment Closure Applied to Autoignition</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Milford, Adrian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Autoignition of high pressure methane jets at engine relveant conditions within a shock tube is investigated using Conditional Moment Closure (CMC). The impact of two commonly used approximations applied in previous work is examined, the assumption of homogeneous turbulence in the closure of the micro-mixing term and the assumption of negligible radial variation of terms within the CMC equations. In the present work two formulations of an inhomogeneous mixing model are implemented, both utilizing the β -PDF, but diﬀering in the respective conditional velocity closure that is applied. The common linear model for conditional velocity is considered, in addition to the gradient diﬀusion model. The validity of cross-stream averaging the CMC equations is examined by comparing results from two-dimensional (axial and radial) solution of the CMC equations with cross-stream averaged results. The CMC equations are presented and all terms requiring closure are discussed. So- lution of the CMC equations is decoupled from the ﬂow ﬁeld solution using the frozen mixing assumption. Detailed chemical kinetics are implemented. The CMC equations are discretized using ﬁnite diﬀerences and solved using a fractional step method. To maintain consistency between the mixing model and the mixture fraction variance equation, the scalar dissipation rate from both implementations of the inhomogeneous model are scaled. The autoignition results for ﬁve air temperatures are compared with results obtained using homogeneous mixing models and experimental data. The gradient diﬀusion conditional velocity model is shown to produce diverging be- haviour in low probability regions. The corresponding proﬁles of conditional scalar dis- sipation rate are negatively impacted with the use of the gradient model, as unphysical behaviour at lean mixtures within the core of the fuel jet is observed. The predictions of ignition delay and location from the Inhomogeneous-Linear model are very close to the homogeneous mixing model results. The Inhomogeneous-Gradient model yields longer ig- nition delays and ignition locations further downstream. This is inﬂuenced by the higher scalar dissipation rates at lean mixtures resulting from the divergent behaviour of the gradient conditional velocity model. The ignition delays obtained by solving the CMC equations in two dimensions are in excellent agreement with the cross-stream averaged values, but the ignition locations are predicted closer to the injector.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Stress intensity factors for elliptical and semi-elliptical cracks subjected to an arbitrary mode l loading</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Atroshchenko, Elena</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Fatigue durability, damage tolerance and strength evaluations of cracked structural components require accurate determination of stress intensity factors (SIF). Most practical crack configurations are embedded and surface breaking planar cracks subjected to complex two-dimensional stress fields. The only cracked body configuration which has been studied analytically for all types of applied stress fields is a circular crack in an infinite elastic solid. However, this model is suitable only for a narrow class of practical applications. Much wider class of practical problems can be solved using the model of an elliptical crack. The exact analytical SIF solutions for an elliptical crack were obtained only for some particular cases of polynomial applied stress fields. In the present work the exact analytical SIF solution has been obtained for an elliptical crack embedded in an infinite elastic body and subjected to an arbitrary applied normal stress field (Mode I). The most effective method of evaluating the stress intensity factor induced by an applied stress field is by using the weight function for a given cracked body. The weight function represents the SIF induced by a unit concentrated load. The only exact analytical weight function for a planar crack was obtained for a circular one. In the present research the exact analytical weight function has been derived for an elliptical crack embedded in an infinite elastic solid. The weight function for an elliptical crack was subsequently employed in the alternating method to obtain the unique SIF solution for a surface breaking semi-elliptical crack in a semi-infinite body subjected to an arbitrary applied stress field. The solutions obtained in the present work can be used in various practical applications, such as cracks in pressure vessels, welded structures and mechanical engineering components subjected to cyclic loading.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Bio-optical Modeling of Aquatic Photosynthesis in the Laurentian Great Lakes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Silsbe, Gregory</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The methodology of phytoplankton production measurements in the Laurentian Great Lakes and other freshwater lakes has remained largely unchanged in the past 40 years. In most studies photosynthesis from a single water sample is measured across an in vitro light gradient usually using an artificial light source then extrapolating to the in situ environment. These traditional methods are laborious, thus limiting the amount of observations in space and time, and may not accurately represent in situ photosynthesis. Active chl a fluorescence, intrinsically linked to photosynthesis, can be measured in situ and instantaneously. Various bio-optical models that scale these fluorescence measurements to phytoplankton production are gaining widespread attention in the marine environment but have not been extensively tested in freshwater ecosystems. The methodology and efficacy of the various bio-optical models are tested in this thesis using a large dataset of active fluorescence profiles and ancillary water chemistry parameters against synchronously derived in vitro phytoplankton production collected across mixing, trophic and taxonomic gradients in Lake Erie. From this analysis, the most common bio-optical model parameterization yields photosynthetic rates that are largely incongruent with in vitro measurements. Bio-optical models are largely a function of two parameters, the absorption spectrum of photosystem II (aPSII) and the photochemical efficiency of PSII (fPSII). In Lake Erie fPSII is relatively constrained suggesting that even nutrient limited phytoplankton achieve balanced growth by adjusting the supply of energy through changes in light harvesting (aPSII) to match the demand for photosynthetic energy. This thesis goes on to demonstrate the success of bio-optical models depends largely on the formulation of aPSII. Alternative methods to derive aPSII, largely ignored in published bio-optical models, are reviewed, formulated, and when incorporated into a bio-optical model and compared to synchronous in vitro production measurements, this novel bio-optical model outperforms all other comparative studies performed across a taxonomic gradient.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Guided-Wave Superconducting Quantum Optoelectronic Devices</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ghohroodi Ghamsari, Behnood</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis investigates a novel optoelectronic platform based on the integration of superconductive structures, such as thin films and micro-constrictions, with optical waveguides for ultra-fast and ultra-sensitive devices with applications including high-speed optical communications, quantum optical information processing, and terahertz (THz) devices and systems. The kinetic-inductive photoresponse of superconducting thin films will be studied as the basic optoelectronic process underlying the operation of these novel devices. Analytical formulation for the non-bolometric response is presented, and experimental photodetection in YBCO meander-line structures will be demonstrated. A set of superconducting coplanar waveguides (CPW) are designed and characterized, which support the operation of the devices at microwave frequencies. Microwave-photonic devices comprising a microwave transmission line and a light-sensitive element, such as a meander-line structure, are designed and measured for implementation of optically tunable microwave components. In order to support low-loss and low-dispersion propagation of millimeter-wave and THz signals in ultra-fast and wideband kinetic-inductive devices, surface-wave transmission lines are proposed, incorporating long-wavelength Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) modes in planar metal-dielectric waveguides. The theory of superconducting optical waveguides, including analytical formulation and numerical methods, is developed in detail. The implementation of superconducting optical waveguides is discussed thoroughly, employing conventional dielectric-waveguide techniques as well as optical SPP modes. Superconductive traveling-wave photodetectors (STWPDs) are introduced as a viable means for ultra-fast and ultra-sensitive photodetection and photomixing. A modified transmission line formalism is developed to model STWPDs, where light is guided through an optical waveguide and photodetection is distributed along a transmission line. As an appendix, a systematic approach is developed for the analysis of carrier transport through superconducting heterostructures and micro-constrictions within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) framework. The method is applied to study the role of Andreev reflection and Josephson-like phenomena in the current-voltage characteristics of inhomogeneous superconducting structures. I-V characteristics are experimentally demonstrated in YBCO micro-constrictions with potential applications in millimeter-wave and THz devices.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electron-phonon Coupling in Quasi-Two-Dimensional Correlated Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Johnston, Steven Sinclair</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Over the past 20 years a great deal of progress has been made towards understanding the physics of the high-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductors. Much of the low- energy physics of these materials appears to be captured by two-dimensional Hubbard or t-J models which have provided significant insight into a number of properties such as the pseudogap, antiferromagnetism and superconductivity itself. However, intrinsically planar models are unable to account for the large variations in Tc observed across materials nor do they capture the electron-phonon (el-ph) interaction, the importance of which a number of experimental probes now indicate. This thesis examines the el-ph interaction in cuprates using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. Starting from the microscopic mechanism for coupling to in-plane and c-axis polarized oxygen phonons, the theory of el-ph coupling is presented. The el-ph self-energy is derived in the context of Migdal-Eliashberg theory and then applied to understanding the detailed temperature and doping dependence of the renormalizations observed by Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The qualitative signatures of el- boson coupling in the density of states of a d-wave superconductor are also examined on general grounds and a model calculation is presented for el-ph coupling signatures in the density of states. Following this, the theory is extended to include the effects of screening and the consequences of this theory are explored. Due to the quasi-2D nature of the cuprates, screening is found to anomalously enhance the el-ph contribution to d-wave pairing. This result is then considered in light of the material and doping dependence of Tc and a framework for understanding the materials variations in Tc is presented. From these studies, a detailed picture of the role of the el-ph interaction in the doped cuprates emerges where the interaction, working in conjunction with a dominant pairing interaction, provides much of the materials variations in Tc observed across the cuprate families. Turning towards numerical techniques, small cluster calculations are presented which examine the effects of a local oxygen dopant in an otherwise ideal Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ crystal. Here, it is demonstrated that the dopant locally enhances electronic properties such as the antiferromagnetic exchange energy J via local el-ph coupling to planar local oxygen vibrations. Finally, in an effort to extend the scope of this work to the underdoped region of the phase diagram, an examination of the properties of the single-band Hubbard and Hubbard-Holstein model is carried out using Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo. Here focus is placed on the spectral properties of the model as well as the competition between the the antiferromagnetic and charge-density-wave orders. As with the small cluster calculations, a strong interplay between the magnetic and lattice properties is observed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Information propagation and entanglement generation between two Unruh-DeWitt detectors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cliche, Mathieu</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The setup in which two quantum systems, Alice and Bob, communicate using bosonic field quanta can be viewed as a prototype for wireless quantum communication. In this thesis we focus on the most basic case, where Alice and Bob are modeled as Unruh-DeWitt detectors, i.e., as two-level quantum systems that interact locally through a scalar quantum field. Our aim is to study how information propagation and entanglement generation between the two detectors are impacted by both relativity and by the unavoidable noise that is due to the quantum fluctuations of the field. We start by studying information propagation between the two detectors. Concretely, we construct and study the information-theoretic quantum channel, ξ, i.e., the completely positive trace preserving map between the input density matrix ϱ, in which Alice prepares her detector for the emission, and the output density matrix ϱ '=ξ(ϱ) of Bob's detector at a later time. We confirm that the classical as well as the quantum channel capacity are strictly zero to all orders in perturbation theory for spacelike separations. We then study entanglement generation between the two detectors. Specifically, we discuss how two Unruh-DeWitt detectors can extract entanglement from the vacuum. We show that the detectors can naturally and instantaneously become entangled through a Casimir-Polder effect. We then analyze the impact of various additions to this setup, such as the presence of a weak gravitational field, the presence of boundary conditions in the field, the presence of a weak classical potential, etc.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantum Coherence in Electrical Circuits</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Amirloo Abolfathi, Jeyran</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis studies quantum coherence in macroscopic and mesoscopic dissipative electrical circuits, including LC circuits, microwave resonators, and Josephson junctions. For the LC resonator and the terminated transmission line microwave resonator, second quantization is carried out for the lossless system and dissipation in modeled as the coupling to a bath of harmonic oscillators. Stationary states of the linear and nonlinear resonator circuits as well as the associated energy levels are found, and the time evolution of uncertainty relations for the observables such as flux, charge, current, and voltage are obtained. Coherent states of both the lossless and weakly dissipative circuits are studied within a quantum optical approach based on a Fokker-Plank equation for the P-representation of the density matrix which has been utilized to obtain time-variations of the averages and uncertainties of circuit observables. Macroscopic quantum tunneling is addressed for a driven dissipative Josephson resonator from its metastable current state to the continuum of stable voltage states. The Caldeira-Leggett method and the instanton path integral technique have been used to find the tunneling rate of a driven Josephson junction from a zero-voltage state to the continuum of the voltage states in the presence of dissipation. Upper and lower bounds are obtained for the tunneling rate at the intermediate loss and approximate closed form expressions are derived for the overdamped and underdamped limits.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Terahertz Quantum Cascade Lasers: towards high performance operation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Fathololoumi, Saeed</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Terahertz (THz) frequency range (wavelength of 300-30 μm, frequency of 1-10 THz and photon energy of ~4-40meV), the gap between infrared and microwave electromagnetic waves, have remained relatively unexplored for a long time, due to lack of a high power, coherent, and compact source, as well as the lack of an appropriate detector and the transmission devices. THz wave has recently received considerable attention for potential applications in non-invasive medical imaging, detecting trace of gases in the environment, sensing of organic and biological molecules, security controls, local oscillators for heterodyne receiver systems, free space communication, etc. THz quantum cascade laser (QCL), as the relatively high power and coherent THz radiation source, was demonstrated in 2002. After near a decade of intense research, THz QCLs operate only up to 186K in pulse mode with maximum power of 250 mW at 10 K. This thesis discusses many aspects of theoretical and experimental design considerations for THz QCLs. The objective is to obtain a laser device that emits high powers and works towards the temperatures achievable by thermoelectric coolers. This work includes designing the active gain medium, and the engineering of the waveguide and heat removal structures. A density matrix based model is developed to explain the charge transport and gain mechanism in the intersubband devices, particularly for three well resonant phonon based THz QCLs. The model allows for designing of the optimum and novel active gain mediums that work at higher temperatures. The designed active gain mediums are fabricated using discussed low loss waveguide and efficient heat removal structures. The maximum operating temperatures as high as ~176 K is achieved. Finally a promising lasing scheme based on phonon-photon-phonon emissions is proposed that improves the population inversion and offers high gain peak.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Cerebrospinal Fluid Pulsations and Aging Effects in Mathematical Models of Hydrocephalus</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wilkie, Kathleen Patricia</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this Thesis we develop mathematical models to analyze two proposed causative mechanisms for the ventricular expansion observed in hydrocephalus: cerebrospinal fluid pulsations and small transmantle pressure gradients. To begin, we describe a single compartment model and show that such simple one-dimensional models cannot represent the complex dynamics of the brain. Hence, all subsequent models of this Thesis are spatio-temporal. Next, we develop a poroelastic model to analyze the fluid-solid interactions caused by the pulsations. Periodic boundary conditions are applied and the system is solved analytically for the tissue displacement, pore pressure, and fluid filtration. The model demonstrates that fluid oscillates across the brain boundaries. We develop a pore flow model to determine the shear induced on a cell by this fluid flow, and a comparison with data indicates that these shear forces are negligible. Thus, only the material stresses remain as a possible mechanism for tissue damage and ventricular expansion. In order to analyze the material stresses caused by the pulsations, we develop a fractional order viscoelastic model based on the linear Zener model. Boundary conditions appropriate for infants and adults are applied and the tissue displacement and stresses are solved analytically. A comparison of the tissue stresses to tension data indicates that these stresses are insufficient to cause tissue damage and thus ventricular expansion. Using age-dependent data, we then determine the fractional Zener model parameter values for infant and adult cerebra. The predictions for displacement and stresses are recomputed and the infant displacement is found to be unphysical. We propose a new infant boundary condition which reduces the tissue displacement to a physically reasonable value. The model stresses, however, are unchanged and thus the pulsation-induced stresses remain insufficient to cause tissue damage and ventricular expansion. Lastly, we develop a fractional hyper-viscoelastic model, based on the Kelvin- Voigt model, to obtain large deformation predictions. Using boundary conditions and parameter values for infants, we determine the finite deformation caused by a small pressure gradient by summing the small strain deformation resulting from pressure gradient increments. This iterative technique predicts that pediatric hydrocephalus may be caused by the long-term existence of small transmantle pressure gradients. We conclude the Thesis with a discussion of the results and their implications for hydrocephalus research as well as a discussion of future endeavors.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>SENSORY BELIEFS ABOUT “LIGHT” AND “LOW TAR” CIGARETTES INFLUENCE THE BELIEF THAT “LIGHT” AND “LOW TAR” CIGARETTES ARE LESS HARMFUL: EVIDENCE FROM CANADA, THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM, AUSTRALIA, AND CHINA</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Elton, Tara</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>“Light” and “low tar” cigarettes have been designed by the tobacco industry to allay smokers’ concerns about the health risks of smoking. Few studies have examined which factors lead smokers to believe that “light” cigarettes are less harmful. In particular few studies have addressed whether the belief that “light” cigarettes are smoother predicts the belief that “light” cigarettes are less harmful. There is some evidence that this relation should exist especially given that the belief that “light” cigarettes are smoother has been used to market these cigarettes and there is a natural association between smoother and less harmful. I conducted 7 studies to examine various aspects of the relation between the sensory belief that “light,” “low tar” or your own brand of cigarettes is smoother and the belief that “light,” “low tar” or your own brand of cigarettes is less harmful. Study 1 used Wave 1 to Wave longitudinal data from the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey (ITC-4) to demonstrate that smokers in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia who believe that “light” cigarettes are smoother at Wave 1 are significantly more likely to believe that “light” cigarettes are less harmful at Wave 2 (p=0.002, OR=1.59 95% CI 1.19-2.12). Study 2 used Wave 1 cross-sectional data from the International Tobacco Control China Survey (ITC China) to demonstrate that smokers in China who believe that “light” and/or “low tar” cigarettes are smoother are significantly more likely to believe that “light” and/or “low tar” cigarettes are less harmful (p&lt;0.001, OR=62.86 95% CI 47.65-82.91). Study 3 used Wave 1-Wave 2 longitudinal data from the ITC China Survey to demonstrate that smokers in China who believe that “light” and/or “low tar” cigarettes are smoother at Wave 1 are significantly more likely to believe that “light” and/or “low tar” cigarettes are less harmful at Wave 2 (p=0.02 OR=1.63 95% CI 1.10-2.43). Study 4 used Wave 3 cross-sectional data from the North American Student Smoking Survey (NASSS) to demonstrate that adolescent smokers in North America who believe that “light” cigarettes are smoother believe that “light” cigarettes are healthier (p&lt;0.001 OR=3.96 95% CI 2.92-5.36), and in a separate model, that the belief that “light” cigarettes are less harsh also predicts the belief that “light” cigarettes are healthier (p&lt;0.001, OR=5.45 95% CI 4.34-6.84). Study 5 used Wave 3 to Wave 4 longitudinal data from the North American Student Smoking Survey (NASSS) to demonstrate that adolescent smokers in North America who believe that “light” cigarettes are less harsh at Wave 3 predicts the belief that “light” cigarettes are healthier at Wave 4 (p=0.02, OR=1.72 95% CI 1.08-2.72). Studies 6 and 7 examined how the personalized belief that your own brand of cigarettes is smoother related to the belief that your own brand of cigarettes is less harmful. Study 6 used cross-sectional data from Wave 6 of the ITC Four Country Survey in Canada only. Study 6 demonstrated that smokers who believed that their own brand of cigarettes is smoother were significantly more likely to say that their brand of cigarettes is less harmful (p=0.004, OR=2.23 95% CI 1.29-3.86). Study 7 used cross-sectional data from Wave 2 of the ITC China Survey to demonstrate that smokers who believed that their own brand of cigarettes is smoother believed that their brand of cigarettes is less harmful (p&lt;0.001, OR=5.10 95% CI 3.69-7.03). The findings from this dissertation demonstrate the importance of implementing tobacco control policies that address cigarette design and marketing that provide the impression that a cigarette is smoother and therefore less harmful.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Disorder, Geometric Frustration and the Dipolar Interaction in Rare-Earth Magnets</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Quilliam, Jeffrey</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis will present research that studies the role of disorder, geometric frustration and the long range dipolar interaction on the collective behaviour of several insulating, rare earth magnets. Experiments were performed at low temperatures to measure the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility of several materials. Susceptibility was measured with a SQUID magnetometer that has been designed and constructed primarily for the study of slow dynamics in glassy systems. Specifically, this thesis will discuss three distinct topics. The first is the series of materials LiHo(x)Y(1-x)F(4), which are manifestations of the dilute, dipolar coupled Ising model. The low-x portion of the phase diagram has become a rather contentious issue in recent years with both theoretical and experimental groups disagreeing on the existence of a spin glass freezing transition and one experimental group arguing for the existence of an exotic "antiglass'' or spin liquid state resulting from quantum entanglement at x=0.045. We present specific heat and dynamical susceptibility measurements on four stoichiometries in this series: x = 0.018, 0.045, 0.080 and 0.012. No evidence of an unusual antiglass state is observed. Instead, our results show evidence, at all dilution levels studied, of a spin glass freezing transition. Interpretation of experimental data is found to be complicated by the anomalously slow dynamics in these materials. The relaxation time scales are found to increase as the concentration of Ho(3+) ions is reduced, an effect which can be attributed to single-ion physics and the importance of the nuclear hyperfine coupling in this system. A second set of materials studied here is a series of several Gd garnet materials, the most famous of which is Gd(3)Ga(5)O(12) (GGG), a material previously argued to be a disorder-free spin glass. Our specific heat experiments reproduce previous experiments on GGG and show that the homologous Gd garnets Gd(3)Te(2)Li(3)O(12) and Ga(3)Al(5)O(12) do not share the same glassy physics but exhibit sharp ordering features. By experimenting with the introduction of random site dilution, it is concluded that a 1-2% off-stoichiometry inherent in GGG is likely a special kind of disorder that is particularly effective in inducing random frustration and the formation of a spin glass. Finally, specific heat measurements on the pyrochlore antiferromagnet Gd(2)Sn(2)O(7) (GSO) are presented. While GSO has generally been found to be a well behaved and well understood model magnet, with long range order developing at around 1 K, like many other geometrically frustrated magnets, it has been discovered to possess persistent spin dynamics down to very low temperatures as measured by μSR and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Measurement of the low temperature limit of the specific heat when compared with linear spin-wave theory, however, presents a consistent picture of gapped magnon excitations that freeze out at low temperatures and make the existence of the proposed dynamic ground state unlikely.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Origin of NMR Spectral Features in MCM-41 at Low Hydrations</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Niknam, Mohamad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Although extensive literature exists on NMR of water in MCM-41, the origin of a number of NMR spectral features in this material had not been understood. Specifically, the OH proton resonance observed in the dry material disappears completely as it is hydrated to 0.2 mono-layer hydration level. The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the physical basics for these spectral features and in the process broaden our understanding of behaviour/interactions of water molecules in porous material. First, measurements of MAS spectra as a function of temperature and hydration, at very low hydrations, made possible a definitive spectral peak assignment. Second, using 1D and 2D selective inversion recovery and magnetization exchange experiments, as well as MAS and non-MAS techniques, magnetization exchange between the water protons and surface OH group protons was quantified. The present results lead to the conclusion that chemical exchange is not responsible for producing the observed changes in proton spectra in MCM-41 as this material is hydrated up to the 0.2 mono-layer hydration level. This represents an important result as it is at odds with what is assumed in the literature in this connection and means that previous conclusions about hydration dynamics in this material need to be revisited. A dynamics model of water interaction with the surface OH hydration sites was introduced to explain the observed proton spectra. The model can successfully predict the observed chemical shifts and temperature dependent changes of proton spectra in the very low hydration MCM-41.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental and Numerical Investigations of the Flow Development over Circular Cylinders with Stepwise Discontinuities in Diameter</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Morton, Christopher R</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Flow past circular cylinders with stepwise discontinuities in diameter was investigated experimentally and numerically for the diameter ratio D/d = 2 and three Reynolds numbers, Re = 150, 300, and 1050. The investigation was focused on the vortex shedding phenomena occurring in the wake of the cylinders. In the first series of experimental and numerical studies, the flow development past a single step cylinder was investigated. The single step cylinder model is comprised of a small diameter cylinder (d) attached coaxially to a large diameter cylinder (D). The results show that three distinct spanwise vortex cells form in the step cylinder wake: a single vortex shedding cell in the wake of the small cylinder (the S-cell) and two vortex shedding cells in the wake of the large cylinder, one in the region downstream of the step (the N-cell) and the other away from the step (the L-cell). Due to the differences in vortex shedding frequencies between the three cells, complex vortex connections occur in two vortex-interaction regions located between the adjacent cells. The region at the boundary between the S-cell and the N-cell is relatively narrow and its spanwise extent does not fluctuate significantly. In this region, vortex dislocations manifested as half-loop connections between two S-cell vortices of opposite sign. In contrast, the region at the boundary between the N-cell and the L-cell exhibits a transient behavior, with large scale vortex dislocations causing cyclic variation in the extent of N-cell vortices. For Re = 300 and 1050, small scale streamwise vortices forming in the wake complicate the vortex dynamics within the adjacent S-cell and L-cell. There is no significant Reynolds number effect on the average spanwise extent of the vortex cells and the two transition regions between neighboring cells. Finally, formation of N-cell vortices is linked to downwash fluctuations near the step. The flow development past a dual step cylinder was studied experimentally for Re = 1050. The dual step cylinder model is comprised of a small diameter cylinder (d) and a large diameter cylinder (D) mounted at the mid-span of the small cylinder. The experiments were completed for a range of large cylinder aspect ratios 0.2 ≤ L/D ≤ 17. The flow development is highly dependent on the aspect ratio of the large cylinder, L/D. The results identify four distinct flow regimes: (i) for L/D = 17, three vortex shedding cells form in the wake of the large cylinder, one central cell and two cells of lower frequency extending over about 4.5D from the large cylinder ends, (ii) for 7 &lt; L/D ≤ 14, a single vortex shedding cell forms in the wake of the large cylinder, whose shedding frequency decreases with decreasing L/D, (iii) for 2 ≤ L/D ≤ 7, vortex shedding in the wake of the large cylinder is highly three-dimensional, with vortices deforming in the near wake, (iv) for 0.2 ≤ L/D ≤ 1, only small cylinder vortices are shed in the wake and can form vortex connections across the wake of the large cylinder.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>New Arsenides and Antimonides as Thermoelectric Materials and Chalcogenides with Distorted Square Nets</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Xu, Hong</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Thermoelectric (TE) materials can be ranked by their figure-of-merit, ZT, which is defined as ZT = (S2σT)/κ. Herein, T is the average temperature between the cold (TC) and hot sides (TH) of the thermoelectric device, S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ and κ are electrical and thermal conductivity, respectively. Presently, the applications of TE devices are limited by their low energy conversion efficiencies. The energy conversion efficiency includes the Carnot term [(TH-TC)/TC], an unattainable upper limit of efficiency for any real system, and a loss term, which depends on the ZT value. A larger temperature difference will produce a larger Carnot efficiency, and a higher ZT value will improve the loss efficiency. Thus, the combination of a larger temperature difference and higher ZT will lead to higher energy conversion efficiency, e.g. with ZT = 1, TH = 1000 K, TC = 300K, the efficiency can reach 17%. It is therefore important to explore TE materials that can be used at high temperatures (around 1000 K). Unfortunately there are very few materials that are stable and efficient under such strict conditions. Our group commenced an investigation of the Ir3Ge7 family materials in the late 1990s. My thesis work had been focused on the synthesis and optimization of Mo3Sb7-xTex and Re3(Si, Ge, Sn, Pb)xAs7-x, the ternary substitution variants of Mo3Sb7 and Re3As7. They exhibited the semiconductivity by partial Sb/Te or (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb)/As exchange, as predicted by electronic structure calculations (linear muffin-tin orbital method) and confirmed by physical property measurements. Furthermore, some transition metal atoms with the proper size, such as Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, were intercalated into the existing cubic voids of the crystal structure in an attempt to reduce the phonon conductivity. Rietveld refinements using GSAS software were employed to analyze the (Si, Sn, Pb)/As ordering and distribution preference. Partial characterizations were conducted at University of Waterloo on cold-pressed pellets. The high temperature measurements were performed on hot-pressed pellets at Clemson University. Another project I worked on was about how to open a band gap by changing the bonding interactions. Some compounds containing the layered square nets structure may behave like a metal or like a semimetal. A band gap can be opened by distorting the square net into less symmetric layers, containing cis–trans or zig–zag chains, resulting in changes of the electronic structure around the Fermi level, therefore widening or opening a band gap. In some pnictide compounds, regular planar square nets of pnictogen atoms with half (“hypervalent” one-electron) bonding are prone to undergo Peierls distortions. Such materials are of great interest for thermoelectric energy conversion because the narrow band gap is advantageous for high-performance thermoelectric properties. The ternary and quaternary chalcogenides, LaAsSe and LaCuxAsSe, were prepared and investigated in this thesis. Seebeck coefficient measurements proved they are semiconductors. Rietveld refinements indicated the As atoms adopt a cis-trans distortion, which changes the structure type from ZrSiS (space group P4/nmm) to GdPS (space group Pnma). Consequently, a band gap is opened, in accordance with the electronic structure calculation. Single crystal structure determination showed LaCu0.12(1)AsSe adopts a derivative structure of the ZrSiS type, with deficient Cu sites inserted between La and As layers. The refinement based on As split sites is preferred.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Performance of Pillars in Rock Salt Mines</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lau, Linda I Hein</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The viscoelastic and creep properties of salt create challenges in the design of salt mines. Salt undergoes steady state creep for a long period of time, and the time of failure is not easily predicted. Developing functions for creep behavior is important in predicting the deformation of salt pillars. Through literature reviews, it was found that there are many relationships to determine the deformation rate of salt specimens through constitutive models. Mine panels have also been modeled to understand the stress and deformational behavior of the pillars. The purpose of this was project was to develop a relationship that determines the convergence rate from knowing the pillar width to pillar height ratio and thickness of the salt strata immediately above and below the mine. The third power law was adopted in the modeling of salt pillars, which is applicable to low stresses of less than 10 MPa that is typical of salt mine conditions. The finite difference software, FLAC3D was used for the simulations of salt pillar models. A square pillar was modeled using four pillar width to pillar height ratios from 1.5 to 4.6. In mining practices, the pillar width to pillar height ratios are designed to be 1.0 to 5.0. Three sets of pillar dimensions were used for each pillar width to pillar height ratio, this was done to determine whether different room and pillar dimensions for each pillar width to pillar height ratio resulted in different convergence rates. Eight salt thicknesses of 0 m to 26 m were modeled for each set of pillar dimensions, which was sufficient to determine the effect of salt thickness on convergence rate. From the modeled results, general trends among the various pillar width to pillar height ratios were observed. The convergence rate increased as the pillar width to pillar height ratio decreased. In addition, an exponential relationship was found between the convergence rate and the pillar width to pillar height ratio. There was a strong correlation between convergence values calculated from the developed function and the modeled values for the power law exponent of three. The developed expression can be used to estimate the convergence rate due to pillar compression and room convergence.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Universal Control in 1e-2n Spin System Utilizing Anisotropic Hyperfine Interactions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhang, Yingjie</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>ESR quantum computing presents faster means to perform gates on nuclear spins than the traditional NMR methods. This means ESR is a test-bed that can potentially be useful in ways that are not possible with NMR. The first step is to demonstrate universal control in the ESR system. This work focuses on spin systems with one electron spin and two nuclear spins. We try to demonstrate control over the nuclear spins using the electron as an actuator. In order to perform the experiments, a customized ESR spectrometer was built in the lab. The main advantage of the home-built system is the ability to send arbitrary pulses to the spins. This ability is the key to perform high fidelity controls on the spin system. A customized low temperature probe was designed and built to have three features necessary for the experiments. First, it is possible to orient the sample, thus to change the spin Hamiltonian of the system, in situ. Second, the combined system is able to perform ESR experiments at liquid nitrogen and liquid helium temperatures and rotate the sample while it is cold. Last, the pulse bandwidth of the microwave resonator, which directly affects the fidelity of the gates, is held constant with respect to the sample temperature. Simulations of the experiments have been carried out and the results are promising. Preliminary experiments have been performed, the final set of experiments, demonstrating full quantum control of a three-spin system, are underway at present.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Realization of novel entangled photon sources using periodically poled materials</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hamel, Deny R.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis deals with the production of entangled photons using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). We start with a short overview of some important theoretical concepts. First we provide a brief reminder of the theory of entanglement. We then discuss how the state of quantum systems can be determined using quantum state tomography. We also explain SPDC, the physical process which we use to produce entangled photons. Finally, we give an overview of the methods which have been used to produce entangled photons in the past, both for two- and three-photon entanglement. The first experiment is the design of an efficient source of entangled photon pairs based on a polarizing Sagnac interferometer configuration. With this configuration, we can use quasi-phasematched materials which allow for higher efficiencies than standard bulk nonlinear materials. The source is pumped by a low-power continuous-wave laser diode, and produces degenerate photon pairs at 809nm. It has a spectral brightness of 87,500 pairs/(s mW nm), and the fidelity of the produced quantum states with a Bell state is 98.9%. The source is used for experiments in quantum key distribution, cluster state quantum computing, remote state preparation, state discrimination, and entanglement-enhanced classical communication. The second experiment discussed in this thesis is the generation of photon triplets using cascaded SPDC. In this experiment, a primary SPDC source is pumped with a low-power, continuous-wave laser diode, producing photon pairs. Single photons from these pairs serve as the pump for a second down-conversion, resulting in photon triplets. This is the first demonstration of the direct production of photon triplets, and the first observation of SPDC at the single photon level. This method could potentially be used to produce entangled photon triplets without post-selection, and as a source of triggered Bell pairs.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Ultra-low temperature dilatometry</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Dunn, John Leonard</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents research of two novel magnetic materials, LiHoF4 and Tb2Ti2O7. Experiments were performed at low temperatures and in an applied magnetic field to study thermal expansion and magnetostriction using a capacitive dilatometer designed during this project. This thesis presents 3 distinct topics. This manuscript begins with a thermodynamic description of thermal expansion and magnetostriction. The design of a capacitive dilatometer suitable for use at ultra-low temperatures and in high magnetic fields is presented. The thermal expansion of oxygen free high conductivity copper is used as a test of the absolute accuracy of the dilatometer. The first material studied using this dilatometer was LiHoF4. Pure LiHoF4 is a dipolar coupled Ising ferromagnet and in an applied transverse magnetic field is a good representation of the transverse field Ising model. An ongoing discrepancy between theoretical and experimental work motivates further study of this textbook material. Presented here are thermal expansion and magnetostriction measurements of LiHoF4 in an applied transverse field. We find good agreement with existing experimental work. This suggests that there is some aspect of LiHoF4 or the effect of quantum mechanical fluctuations at finite temperatures which is not well understood. The second material studied is the spin liquid Tb2Ti2O7. Despite theoretical predictions that Tb2Ti2O7 will order at finite temperature, a large body of experimental evidence demonstrates that spins within Tb2Ti2O7 remain dynamic to the lowest temperatures studied. In addition Tb2Ti2O7 also exhibits anomalous thermal expansion below 20K, giant magnetostriction, and orders in an applied magnetic field. Thermal expansion and magnetostriction measurements of Tb2Ti2O7 are presented in applied longitudinal and transverse fields. Zero-field thermal expansion measurements do not repeat the previously observed anomalous thermal expansion. A large feature is observed in thermal expansion at 100mK, in rough agreement with existing experimental work. Longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields were applied to Tb2Ti2O7. Longitudinal magnetostriction measurements show qualitatively di erent behavior than previous observations. These measurements were taken along di erent crystal axes so direct comparison cannot be made. Thermal expansion measurements in an applied transverse field show evolution with the strength of the applied field. This evolution may relate to an ordering transition, however difficulties in repeatability in a transverse field require that these results be repeated in an improved setup.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Towards InAs nanowire double quantum dots for quantum information processing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Fung, Jennifer Sy-Wei</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Currently, a major challenge for solid-state spin qubit systems is achieving one-qubit operations on a timescale shorter than the spin coherence time, T2*, a goal currently two orders of magnitude away. By taking advantage of the quasi-one-dimensional structure of a nanowire and the strong spin-orbit interaction of InAs, it is estimated that π-rotations can be implemented using electric dipole spin resonance on the order of 10 ns. To this end, a procedure for the fabrication of homogeneous InAs nanowire quantum dot devices is presented herein for future investigations of solid state spin qubits as a test bed for quantum computing. Both single and double quantum dot systems are formed using local gating of InAs nanowires. Single quantum dot systems were characterized through electron transport measurements in a dilution refrigerator; in one case, the charging energy was measured to be 5.0 meV and the orbital energy was measured to be 1.5-3.5 meV. The total capacitance of the single quantum dot system was determined to be approximately 30 aF. An estimate of the quantum dot geometry resulting from confinement suggests that the quantum dot is approximately 115 nm long. The coupling energy of the double quantum dot system was measured to be approximately 4.5 meV. The electron temperature achieved with our circuitry in the dilution refrigerator is estimated to be approximately 125 mK.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Applications of Adiabatic Approximation to One- and Two-electron Phenomena in Strong Laser Fields</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bondar, Denys</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The adiabatic approximation is a natural approach for the description of phenomena induced by low frequency laser radiation because the ratio of the laser frequency to the characteristic frequency of an atom or a molecule is a small parameter. Since the main aim of this work is the study of ionization phenomena, the version of the adiabatic approximation that can account for the transition from a bound state to the continuum must be employed. Despite much work in this topic, a universally accepted adiabatic approach of bound-free transitions is lacking. Hence, based on Savichev's modified adiabatic approximation [Sov. Phys. JETP 73, 803 (1991)], we first of all derive the most convenient form of the adiabatic approximation for the problems at hand. Connections of the obtained result with the quasiclassical approximation and other previous investigations are discussed. Then, such an adiabatic approximation is applied to single-electron ionization and non-sequential double ionization of atoms in a strong low frequency laser field. The momentum distribution of photoelectrons induced by single-electron ionization is obtained analytically without any assumptions on the momentum of the electrons. Previous known results are derived as special cases of this general momentum distribution. The correlated momentum distribution of two-electrons due to non-sequential double ionization of atoms is calculated semi-analytically. We focus on the deeply quantum regime -- the below intensity threshold regime, where the energy of the active electron driven by the laser field is insufficient to collisionally ionize the parent ion, and the assistance of the laser field is required to create a doubly charged ion. A special attention is paid to the role of Coulomb interactions in the process. The signatures of electron-electron repulsion, electron-core attraction, and electron-laser interaction are identified. The results are compared with available experimental data. Two-electron correlated spectra of non-sequential double ionization below intensity threshold are known to exhibit back-to-back scattering of the electrons, viz., the anticorrelation of the electrons. Currently, the widely accepted interpretation of the anticorrelation is recollision-induced excitation of the ion plus subsequent field ionization of the second electron. We argue that there exists another mechanism, namely simultaneous electron emission, when the time of return of the rescattered electron is equal to the time of liberation of the bounded electron (the ion has no time for excitation), that can also explain the anticorrelation of the electrons in the deep below intensity threshold regime. Finally, we study single-electron molecular ionization. Based on the geometrical approach to tunnelling by P. D. Hislop and I. M. Sigal [Memoir. AMS 78, No. 399 (1989)], we introduce the concept of a leading tunnelling trajectory. It is then proven that leading tunnelling trajectories for single active electron models of molecular tunnelling ionization (i.e., theories where a molecular potential is modelled by a single-electron multi-centre potential) are linear in the case of short range interactions and ``almost'' linear in the case of long range interactions. The results are presented on both the formal and physically intuitive levels. Physical implications of the proven statements are discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Application of Complex Vectors and Complex Transformations in Solving Maxwell’s Equations</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Saleh-Anaraki, Payam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Application and implication of using complex vectors and complex transformations in solutions of Maxwell’s equations is investigated. Complex vectors are used in complex plane waves and help to represent this type of waves geometrically. It is shown that they are also useful in representing inhomogeneous plane waves in plasma, single-negative and double-negative metamaterials. In specific I will investigate the Otto configuration and Kretschmann configuration and I will show that in order to observe the minimum in reflection coefficient it is necessary for the metal to be lossy. We will compare this to the case of plasmon-like resonance when a PEC periodic structure is illuminated by a plane wave. Complex transformations are crucial in deriving Gaussian beam solutions of paraxial Helmholtz equation from spherical wave solution of Helmholtz equation. Vector Gaussian beams also will be discussed shortly.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Investigation of the scalar variance and scalar dissipation rate in URANS and LES</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ye, Isaac Keeheon</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Large-eddy simulation (LES) and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) calculations have been performed to investigate the effects of different mathematical models for scalar variance and its dissipation rate as applied to both a non-reacting bluff-body turbulent flow and an extension to a reacting case. In the conserved scalar formalism, the mean value of a thermo-chemical variable is obtained through the PDF-weighted integration of the local description over the conserved scalar, the mixture fraction. The scalar variance, one of the key parameters for the determination of a presumed β-function PDF, is obtained by solving its own transport equation with the unclosed scalar dissipation rate modelled using either an algebraic expression or a transport equation. The proposed approach is first applied to URANS and then extended to LES. Velocity, length and time scales associated with the URANS modelling are determined using the standard two-equation k-ε transport model. In contrast, all three scales required by the LES modelling are based on the Smagorinsky subgrid scale (SGS) algebraic model. The present study proposes a new algebraic and a new transport LES model for the scalar dissipation rate required by the transport equation for scalar variance, with a time scale consistent with the Smagorinsky SGS model.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Flow Down a Wavy Inclined Plane</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ogden, Kelly Anne</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Under certain conditions, flow down an inclined plane destabilizes and a persistent series of interfacial waves develop. An interest in determining under what conditions a flow becomes unstable and how the interface develops has motivated researchers to derive several models for analyzing this problem. The first part of this thesis compares three models for flow down a wavy, inclined plane with the goal of determining which best predicts features of the flow. These models are the shallow-water model (SWM), the integral-boundary-layer (IBL) model, and the weighted residual model (WRM). The model predictions for the critical Reynolds number for flow over an even bottom are compared to the theoretical value, and the WRM is found to match the theoretical value exactly. The neutral stability curves predicted by the three models are compared to two sets of experimental data, and again the WRM most closely matches the experimental data. Numerical solutions of the IBL model and the WRM are compared to numerical solutions of the full Navier-Stokes equations; both models compare well, although the WRM matches slightly better. Finally, the critical Reynolds numbers for the IBL model and the WRM for flow over a wavy incline are compared to experimental data. Both models give results close to the data and perform equally well. These comparisons indicate that the WRM most accurately models the flow. In the second part of the thesis, the WRM is extended to include the effects of bottom heating and permeability. The model is used to predict the effect of heating and permeability on the stability of the flow, and the results are compared to theoretical predictions from the Benney equation and to a perturbation solution of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation from the literature. The results indicate that the model does faithfully predict the theoretical critical Reynolds number with heating and permeability, and both effects destabilize the flow. Finally, numerical simulations of the model equations are compared to full numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations for the case with bottom permeability. The results are found to agree, which indicates that the WRM remains appropriate when permeability is included.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Investing Flow over an Airfoil at Low Reynolds Numbers Using Novel Time-Resolved Surface Pressure Measurements</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gerakopulos, Ryan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>An aluminum NACA 0018 airfoil testbed was constructed with 95 static pressure taps and 25 embedded microphones to enable novel time-resolved measurements of surface pressure. The main objective of this investigation is to utilize time-resolved surface pressure measurements to estimate salient flow characteristics in the separated flow region over the upper surface of an airfoil. The flow development over the airfoil was examined using hot wire anemometry and mean surface pressure for a range of Reynolds numbers from 80x103 to 200x103 and angles of attack from 0° to 18°. For these parameters, laminar boundary layer separation takes place on the upper surface and two flow regimes occur: (i) separation is followed by flow reattachment, so that a separation bubble forms and (ii) separation occurs without subsequent reattachment. Measurements of velocity and mean surface pressure were used to characterize the separated flow region and its effect on airfoil performance using the lift coefficient. In addition, the transition process and the evolution of disturbances were examined. The lift curve characteristics were found to be linked to the rate of change of the separation, transition, and reattachment locations with the angle of attack. For both flow regimes, transition was observed in the separated shear layer. Specifically, the amplification of disturbances within a band of frequencies in the separated shear layer resulted in laminar to turbulent transition. Validation of time-resolved surface pressure measurements was performed for Rec = 100x103 at α = 8° and α = 12°, corresponding to regimes of flow separation with and without reattachment, respectively. A comparative analysis of simultaneous velocity and time-resolved surface pressure measurements showed that the characteristics and development of velocity fluctuations associated with disturbances in the separated shear layer can be extracted from time-resolved surface pressure measurements. Specifically, within the separated flow region, the amplitude of periodic oscillations in the surface pressure signal associated with disturbances in the separated shear layer grew in the streamwise direction. In addition, the frequency at the spectral peak of the amplified disturbances in the separated shear layer was identified. Based on the results of the validation analysis, time-resolved surface pressure measurement analysis techniques were applied for a Reynolds number range from 60x103 to 130x103 and angles of attack from 6° to 16°. Within the separated flow region, the streamwise growth of surface pressure fluctuations is distinctly different depending on the flow regime. Specifically, within the separation bubble, the RMS surface pressure fluctuations increase in the streamwise direction and reach a peak just upstream of the reattachment location. The observed trend is in agreement with that observed for other separating-reattaching flows on geometries such as the forward and backward facing step and splitter plate with fence. In contrast to the separation bubble formation, when the separated shear layer fails to reattach to the airfoil surface, RMS surface pressure fluctuations increase in the streamwise direction with no maximum and the amplitude is significantly lower than those observed in the separation bubble. Surface pressure signals were further examined to identify the frequency, convective velocity, and spanwise uniformity of disturbances in the separated shear layer. Specifically, for both flow regimes, the fundamental frequency and corresponding Strouhal number exhibit a power-law dependency on the Reynolds number. Based on the available data for which velocity measurements were obtained in the separated flow region, the convective velocity matched the mean velocity at the wall-normal distance corresponding to the maximum turbulence intensity. A distinct increase in the convective velocity of disturbances in the separated shear layer was found when the airfoil was stalled in comparison to that found in the separation bubble. From statistical analysis of surface pressure signals in the spanwise direction, it was found that disturbances are strongly two-dimensional in the laminar portion of the separated shear layer and become three-dimensional through the transition process.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Metamaterials for Decoupling Antennas and Electromagnetic Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bait Suwailam, Mohammed</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This research focuses on the development of engineered materials, also known as meta- materials, with desirable effective constitutive parameters: electric permittivity (epsilon) and magnetic permeability (mu) to decouple antennas and noise mitigation from electromagnetic systems. An interesting phenomenon of strong relevance to a wide range of problems, where electromagnetic interference is of concern, is the elimination of propagation when one of the constitutive parameters is negative. In such a scenario, transmission of electromagnetic energy would cease, and hence the coupling between radiating systems is reduced. In the first part of this dissertation, novel electromagnetic artificial media have been developed to alleviate the problem of mutual coupling between high-profile and ow-profile antenna systems. The developed design configurations are numerically simulated, and experimentally validated. In the mutual coupling problem between high-profile antennas, a decoupling layer based on artificial magnetic materials (AMM) has been developed and placed between highly-coupled monopole antenna elements spaced by less than Lambda/6, where Lambda is the operating wavelength of the radiating elements. The decoupling layer not only provides high mutual coupling suppression (more than 20-dB) but also maintains good impedance matching and low correlation between the antenna elements suitable for use in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. In the mutual coupling problem between low-profile antennas, novel sub-wavelength complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs) are developed to decouple microstrip patch antenna elements. The proposed design con figuration has the advantage of low-cost production and maintaining the pro file of the antenna system unchanged without the need for extra layers. Using the designed structure, a 10-dB reduction in the mutual coupling between two patch antennas has been achieved. The second part of this dissertation utilizes electromagnetic artificial media for noise mitigation and reduction of undesirable electromagnetic radiation from high-speed printed-circuit boards (PCBs) and modern electronic enclosures with openings (apertures). Numerical results based on the developed design configurations are presented, discussed, and compared with measurements. To alleviate the problem of simultaneous switching noise (SSN) in high-speed microprocessors and personal computers, a novel technique based on cascaded CSRRs has been proposed. The proposed design has achieved a wideband suppression of SSN and maintained a robust signal integrity performance. A novel use of electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures has been proposed to mitigate undesirable electromagnetic radiation from enclosures with openings. By using ribbon of EBG surfaces, a significant suppression of electromagnetic radiation from openings has been achieved.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Energy transport in saturated porous media</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gerasik, Volodymyr</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The energy analysis of the wave motion in the Lamb’s problem for a poroelastic half-space in the framework of Biot’s theory is presented. The results for the energy velocity and quality factor of poroelastic waves are revisited. In the case of no dissipation the approach originally established for perfectly elastic media by Miller &amp; Pursey is generalized herein to include poroelastic waves. Special cases of the resonant excitation of the Rayleigh wave and the absence of the Rayleigh wave beyond the cut-off frequency are discussed in detail. Directional diagrams for the volumetric waves are presented. A quantitative picture of the energy partition among the traveling waves is provided for several driving configurations. In the general case of dissipative media the analysis is based on the semi-analytic solution of the Lamb’s problem. In the near field, the surface load generates three wavetrains corresponding to the bulk modes. These wavetrains consist of waves which are longer and exhibit greater viscous attenuation than the corresponding volumetric modes, so that, P1, P2 and S modes emerge from the corresponding wavetrains at a certain distance from the source. For the far field, asymptotic expressions have been obtained and clearly indicate that it is only in the far field that the wave motion represents the superposition of the P1, P2, S and Rayleigh waves characterized by their corresponding wavelengths and attenuations. Moreover, these waves also exhibit geometric attenuation x^3/2 (similar to the waves in a perfectly elastic half-space). To analyze the energy partition the total input power supplied by the source is decomposed into the contributions associated with the wavetrains and the Rayleigh wave. These results provide the means for controlling the excitation of the various wave modes via changes to the driving configuration. Biot’s theory is a particular example of a non-conservative Lagrangian system with a Rayleigh dissipation function. The group velocities of poroelastic waves are complex and do not provide any information about the velocity of the energy transport. Moreover, in general the precise physical meaning of the complex group velocity is unclear. The analysis based on the detailed study of the coupled system of the damped Klein-Gordon equations (Biot’s theory yields such a formalism in the low frequency limit) suggests that both precise and approximate physical interpretations of the complex group velocity are possible. Moreover, these considerations further allow the derivation of exact closed form expressions for the energy velocity and Q factor for both longitudinal and shear poroelastic waves from energy principles. Most notably, the analysis of the resulting expressions reveals that the energy velocity of both longitudinal and shear waves equals (exceeds) the corresponding phase velocity in the case of the low (full) frequency range Biot’s theory. The exact expression for the Q factor contains an additive correction due to viscoelastic interphase interaction in the higher frequency range.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Internal Wave Generation and Near-Resonant Interactions: Theory and Applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rees, Timothy</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Near-resonant triad interactions and wave generation theory are investigated for continuously stratified fluids. Interaction equations are derived for spatially-varying wave trains under the inviscid Boussinesq approximation. Rotational effects are included, and properties of the underlying eigenvalue problem are explored. To facilitate a numerical study of the near-resonant interactions, numerical methods are developed and an analysis of wave generation on a periodic domain is performed. Numerical experiments using laboratory and ocean-scale parameters are conducted, and the simulations confirm the validity of the wave forcing theory. Interaction experiments demonstrate a strong tendency for waves to exhibit nonlinear behaviour. While resonant interactions are observed in the laboratory scale simulations, nonlinear steepening effects and the formation of solitary-like waves dominate the ocean-scale experiments. The results suggest that the weakly-nonlinear interaction theory is only appropriate in a limited parameter regime. The problem of analyzing forced wave equations on an infinite domain is also considered. Motivated by the results obtained on a periodic domain, asymptotic analysis is applied to three important wave equations. The method of steepest descents is used to determine the large-time behaviour for the linearized Korteweg-de Vries, Benjamin-Bona-Mahony, and internal gravity wave equations. The asymptotic results are compared with numerical experiments and found to agree to high precision.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Waveguide Sources of Photon Pairs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Horn, Rolf</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis describes various methods for producing photon pairs from waveguides. It covers relevant topics such as waveguide coupling and phase matching, along with the relevant measurement techniques used to infer photon pair production. A new proposal to solve the phase matching problem is described along with two conceptual methods for generating entangled photon pairs. Photon pairs are also experimentally demonstrated from a third novel structure called a Bragg Reflection Waveguide (BRW). The new proposal to solve the phase matching problem is called Directional Quasi-Phase Matching (DQPM). It is a technique that exploits the directional dependence of the non-linear susceptiblity ($\chi^{(2)}$) tensor. It is aimed at those materials that do not allow birefringent phase-matching or periodic poling. In particular, it focuses on waveguides in which the interplay between the propagation direction, electric field polarizations and the nonlinearity can change the strength and sign of the nonlinear interaction periodically to achieve quasi-phasematching. One of the new conceptual methods for generating entangled photon pairs involves a new technique that sandwiches two waveguides from two differently oriented but similar crystals together. The idea stems from the design of a Michelson interferometer which interferes the paths over which two unique photon pair processes can occur, thereby creating entanglement in any pair of photons created in the interferometer. By forcing or sandwiching the two waveguides together, the physical space that exists in the standard Micheleson type interferometer is made non-existent, and the interferometer is effectively squashed. The result is that the two unique photon pair processes actually occupy the same physical path. This benefits the stability of the interferometer in addition to miniaturizing it. The technical challenges involved in sandwiching the two waveguides are briefly discussed. The main result of this thesis is the observation of photon pairs from the BRW. By analyzing the time correlation between two single photon detection events, spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) of a picosecond pulsed ti:sapph laser is demonstrated. The process is mediated by a ridge BRW. The results show evidence for type-0, type-I and type-II phase matching of pump light at 783nm, 786nm and 789nm to down converted light that is strongly degenerate at 1566nm, 1572nm, and 1578nm respectively. The inferred efficiency of the BRW was 9.8$\cdot$10$^{-9}$ photon pairs per pump photon. This contrasts with the predicted type-0 efficiency of 2.65$\cdot$10$^{-11}$. This data is presented for the first time in such waveguides, and represents significant advances towards the integration of sources of quantum information into the existing telecommunications infrastructure.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Parametric Interaction in Josephson Junction Circuits and Transmission Lines</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mohebbi, Hamid Reza</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This research investigates the realization of parametric amplification in superconducting circuits and structures where nonlinearity is provided by Josephson junction (JJ) elements. We aim to develop a systematic analysis over JJ-based devices toward design of novel traveling-wave Josephson parametric amplifiers (TW-JPA). Chapters of this thesis fall into three categories: lumped JPA, superconducting periodic structures and discrete Josephson transmission lines (DJTL). The unbiased Josephson junction (JJ) is a nonlinear element suitable for parametric amplification through a four-photon process. Two circuit topologies are introduced to capture the unique property of the JJ in order to efficiently mix signal, pump and idler signals for the purpose of signal amplification. Closed-form expressions are derived for gain characteristics, bandwidth determination, noise properties and impedance for this kind of parametric power amplifier. The concept of negative resistance in the gain formulation is observed. A design process is also introduced to find the regimes of operation for gain achievement. Two regimes of operation, oscillation and amplification, are highlighted and distinguished in the result section. Optimization of the circuits to enhance the bandwidth is also carried out. Moving toward TW-JPA, the second part is devoted to modelling the linear wave propagation in a periodic superconducting structure. We derive closed-form equations for dispersion and s-parameters of infinite and finite periodic structures, respectively. Band gap formation is highlighted and its potential applications in the design of passive filters and resonators are discussed. The superconducting structures are fabricated using YBCO and measured, illustrating a good correlation with the numerical results. A novel superconducting Transmission Line (TL), which is periodically loaded by Josephson junctions (JJ) and assisted by open stubs, is proposed as a platform to realize a traveling-wave parametric device. Using the TL model, this structure is modeled by a system of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with a driving source and mixed-boundary conditions at the input and output terminals, respectively. This model successfully emulates parametric and nonlinear microwave propagation when long-wave approximation is applicable. The influence of dispersion to sustain three non-degenerate phased-locked waves through the TL is highlighted. A rigorous and robust Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) solver based on the explicit Lax-Wendroff and implicit Crank-Nicolson schemes has been developed to investigate the device responses under various excitations. Linearization of the wave equation, under small-amplitude assumption, dispersion and impedance analysis is performed to explore more aspects of the device for the purpose of efficient design of a traveling-wave parametric amplifier. Knowing all microwave characteristics and identifying different regimes of operation, which include impedance properties, cut-off propagation, dispersive behaviour and shock-wave formation, we exploit perturbation theory accompanied by the method of multiple scale to derive the three nonlinear coupled amplitude equations to describe the parametric interaction. A graphical technique is suggested to find three waves on the dispersion diagram satisfying the phase-matching conditions. Both cases of perfect phase-matching and slight mismatching are addressed in this work. The incorporation of two numerical techniques, spectral method in space and multistep Adams-Bashforth in time domain, is employed to monitor the unilateral gain, superior stability and bandwidth of this structure. Two types of functionality, mixing and amplification, with their requirements are described. These properties make this structure desirable for applications ranging from superconducting optoelectronics to dispersive readout of superconducting qubits where high sensitivity and ultra-low noise operation is required.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Lounder, Victoria</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The spatial and temporal flow field characteristics of a gravel-bed river supporting a robust rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) fishery were studied in high resolution in attempts to hydraulically quantify the selection preferences and incubation characteristics of redds. Measurements were obtained at both the riffle- and redd-scale post-spawning, in addition to pre- and post-bed mobilization flow events. A Pulse Coherent Acoustic Doppler Profiler (PCADP) was adapted for use in the lotic environment where between 4000 to 5000 three-dimensional velocity measurements could be obtained on a daily basis at the riffle scale. Bed material samples were obtained and scour chains installed to characterise the bed mobility, critical shear, and macro-erosion of each riffle studied. At the riffle-scale, seasonal variability in the mean and variance of commonly used hydrodynamic parameters (velocity, flow depth, Froude number, bed roughness, turbulent kinetic energy per unit area) was often explicitly related to changes in sampling discharge and channel structure. Riffle-scale directional semivariograms isolated varied scales of spatial dependency, and the occurrence of bed mobilizing and channel-forming discharge created a less smooth and poorly defined spatial structure. Redd-scale omnidirectional semivariograms presented the same response to channel-forming discharge, however overall did not reveal a coherent spatial structure. Although the commonly used Froude number did not present patterns or characteristics which could distinguish the redd properties from the riffle, the results for local velocity and turbulence at the redd-scale revealed evidence of optimal physical conditions for salmonid incubation, particularly convective flow acceleration which promotes downwelling at the egg pockets and unidirectional flow with low turbulence, which allows this behaviour to persist through a range in environmental flows.</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Han, Dong</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We propose multigrid methods for solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equations. The methods are based on the full approximation scheme. We propose a damped-relaxation method as smoother for multigrid. In contrast with policy iteration, the relaxation scheme is convergent for both HJB and HJBI equations. We show by local Fourier analysis that the damped-relaxation smoother effectively reduces high frequency error. For problems where the control has jumps, restriction and interpolation methods are devised to capture the jump on the coarse grid as well as during coarse grid correction. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multigrid methods for solving HJB and HJBI equations arising from option pricing as well as problems where policy iteration does not converge or converges slowly.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Searching for the Magnetic Interactions in the Rare Earth Pyrochlore Oxide Yb₂Ti₂O₇</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Thompson, Jordan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Various experiments on Yb₂Ti₂O₇ have shown evidence of strange magnetic behaviour at low temperatures. Specific heat measurements on powder samples of Yb₂Ti₂O₇ show evidence of a sharp peak, indicating the occurence of a first order phase transition. Meanwhile, neutron scattering, Mössbauer absorption, and μSR measurements find no evidence of long range order below the temperature of this phase transition, leaving the nature of the low temperature phase a mystery. Quantifying the magnetic interactions in this material should allow us to better understand the low temperature behaviour of this material. In this study, we fit a symmetry allowed nearest-neighbour bilinear exchange model to quasi-elastic neutron scattering data collected well above the temperature of the experimentally observed phase transition. This neutron scattering data shows evidence of rods of scattering intensity along the ⟨111⟩ crystallographic directions. Neutron scattering probes the correlations between magnetic moments in a material, so fitting an interaction model to the neutron scattering is equivalent to fitting the interactions to the magnetic correlations. These correlations are driven by the interactions between the magnetic moments, so the neutron scattering should give us direct access to the form of these interactions. Using this method we successfully identify an anisotropic nearest-neighbour bilinear exchange model that reproduces the experimentally observed quasi-elastic neutron scattering. With this model we then proceed to compute real space correlation functions, finding that the rods of neutron scattering arise from the presence of strong correlations along nearest-neighbour chains. We also compute the bulk susceptibility and local susceptibility, obtaining very good fits to experiment with no variation of the model determined from the neutron scattering. The success of these calculations provides a further independent confirmation of the success of our interaction model in describing the magnetic interactions in Yb₂Ti₂O₇. Finally, we present a brief summary of ongoing work based on our anisotropic exchange model, including mean field calculations to determine the low temperature ground state of this model and classical Monte Carlo simulations to study the phase transition present in this model. We also discuss potential further studies of this and other models.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental Investigation of Transition over a NACA 0018 Airfoil at a Low Reynolds Number</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Boutilier, Michael Stephen Hatcher</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Shear layer development over a NACA 0018 airfoil at a chord Reynolds number of 100,000 was investigated experimentally. The effects of experimental setup and analysis tools on the results were also examined. The sensitivity of linear stability predictions for measured separated shear layer velocity profiles to both the analysis approach and experimental data scatter was evaluated. Analysis approaches that are relatively insensitive to experimental data scatter were identified. Stability predictions were shown to be more sensitive to the analysis approach than to experimental data scatter, with differences in the predicted maximum disturbance growth rate and corresponding frequency of approximately 35% between approaches. A parametric study on the effects of experimental setup on low Reynolds number airfoil experiments was completed. It was found that measured lift forces and vortex shedding frequencies were affected by the end plate configuration. It was concluded that the ratio of end plate spacing to projected model height should be at least seven, consistent with the guideline for circular cylinders. Measurements before and after test section wall streamlining revealed errors in lift coefficients due to blockage as high as 9% and errors in the wake vortex shedding frequency of 3.5%. Shear layer development over the model was investigated in detail. Flow visualization images linked an observed asymmetry in wake velocity profiles to pronounced vortex roll-up below the wake centerline. Linear stability predictions based on the mean hot-wire profiles were found to agree with measured disturbance growth rates, wave numbers, and streamwise velocity fluctuation profiles. Embedded surface pressure sensors were shown to provide reasonable estimates of disturbance growth rate, wave number, and convection speed for conditions at which a separation bubble formed on the airfoil surface. Convection speeds of between 30 and 50% of the edge velocity were measured, consistent with phase speed estimates from linear stability theory.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hybrid Computational Algorithms for the Problem of Scattering from Grating Structures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Alavikia, Babak</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Modeling of wave scattering from grating couplers has become increasingly important due to extensive recent research interest in the problem of plasmonic resonance. Computational algorithms which are specially used to model the problem of scattering from the grating surfaces suffer from several drawbacks such as accuracy, computational efficiency, and generality. To address the challenges of the previous methods, this work presents a novel hybrid Finite Element-Boundary Integral Method (FE-BIM) solution to the problem of scattering from grating surfaces consisting of finite or infinite array of two-dimensional cavities and holes in an infinite metallic walls covered with a stratified dielectric layer. To solve the scattering problem from finite number of cavities or holes engraved in a perfectly conducting screen (PEC), the solution region is divided into interior regions containing the cavities or holes and the region exterior to them. The finite element formulation is applied inside the interior region to derive a linear system of equations associated with nodal field values. Using two-boundary formulation, the surface integral equation employing free-space Green's function is then applied at \emph{only} the opening of the cavities or holes to truncate the computational domain and to connect the matrix subsystem generated from each cavity or hole. The hybrid FE-BIM method is extended to solve the scattering problem from an infinite array of cavities or holes in a PEC screen by deriving the quasi-periodic Green's function. In the scattering problem from an infinite array of cavities, the finite element formulation is first used inside a single cavity in the unit-cell. Next, the surface integral equation employing the quasi-periodic Green's function is applied at the opening of \emph{only} a single cavity as a boundary constraint to truncate the computational domain. Effect of the infinite array of cavities is incorporated into the system of the nodal equations by the quasi-periodic Green's function. Finally, the method based on the hybrid FE-BIM is developed to solve the scattering problem from grating surfaces covered with a stratified dielectric layer. In this method, the surface integral equation employing grounded dielectric slab Green's function is applied at the opening of the cavities or holes inside the dielectric coating to truncate the solution region efficiently. An accurate algorithm is presented to derive the grounded dielectric slab Green's function in spatial domain incorporating the effects of the surface-waves and leaky-waves excited and propagated inside the dielectric slab. Numerical examples of near and far field calculations for finite or infinite array of cavities or holes are presented to validate accuracy, versatility, and efficiency of the algorithm presented in this thesis.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Hydrodynamics of Pool-Riffle Sequences with Changing Bedform Length</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Obach, Lana M.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Previous research has demonstrated that pool-riffle bedforms play a critical role in channel stability and ecosystem health in many natural gravel-bed channels. Although the bedform length is known to scale with channel width, no experimental research has yet isolated the effect of bedform length on pool-riffle hydrodynamics. To improve the understanding of the hydrodynamics of these bedforms so that they can be better incorporated in restoration practices, flume experiments were conducted testing the flow at seven different bedform lengths. Velocity profiles are measured in a 17 m flume with movable PVC bedforms using ultrasonic velocity profilers (UVPs). Smooth two-dimensional (no sinuosity) bedforms are used in order to isolate the key dynamics in convective acceleration and deceleration. The angle of transition between pool and riffle heights was 7°, so that permanent flow separation did not occur. Parameters calculated from the velocity and turbulence profiles include the Coles’ wake parameter (a measure of the deviation from the log law), shear stress estimated from the velocity profile, shear stress estimated from the Reynolds shear stress, and vertical velocity. From the individual velocity time series, the integral length scale and the integral time scales are also calculated. Overall, the length of riffles and pools exert a fundamental control on the distribution of flow and turbulence within a channel. In the pool, energy is dissipated both through turbulence and as the flow is redistributed to uniform flow conditions. In the riffle, kinetic energy increases as the flow velocity increases, and as the length increases, the flow moves towards a new uniform flow condition. The results start to explain the reasons behind the persistent scaling relation between width and bedform length. It can be concluded that uniform flow conditions exist at the end of the pool when the bedform length ratio is greater than approximately 1:5.0 when the riffle length is held constant, and that uniform flow conditions are no longer observed at the end of the pool when the bedform length ratio exceeds 1:7.0 when the pool length is held constant. Future research should concentrate on extending the results to include three-dimensional pool-riffle configurations, repeating bedform configurations, internal scaling parameters, and sediment transport. Ultimately, as the hydrodynamics of pool-riffle sequences are better understood, better bedform designs can be implemented in restoration projects.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Shape dynamics and Mach's principles: Gravity from conformal geometrodynamics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gryb, Sean Barry</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We develop a new approach to classical gravity starting from Mach's principles and the idea that the local shape of spatial configurations is fundamental. This new theory, shape dynamics, is equivalent to general relativity but differs in an important respect: shape dynamics is a theory of dynamic conformal 3-geometry, not a theory of spacetime. Equivalence is achieved by trading foliation invariance for local conformal invariance (up to a global scale). After the trading, what is left is a gauge theory invariant under 3d diffeomorphisms and conformal transformations that preserve the volume of space. There is one non-local global Hamiltonian that generates the dynamics. Thus, shape dynamics is a formulation of gravity that is free of the local problem of time. In addition, the symmetry principle is simpler than that of general relativity because the local constraints are linear. Therefore, shape dynamics provides a novel new starting point for quantum gravity. Furthermore, the conformal invariance provides an ideal setting for studying the relationship between gravity and boundary conformal field theories. The procedure for the trading of symmetries was inspired by a technique called best matching. We explain best matching and its relation to Mach's principles. The key features of best matching are illustrated through finite dimensional toy models. A general picture is then established where relational theories are treated as gauge theories on configuration space. Shape dynamics is then constructed by applying best matching to conformal geometry. We then study shape dynamics in more detail by computing its Hamiltonian perturbatively and establishing a connection with conformal field theory.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>High-Resolution Numerical Simulations of Wind-Driven Gyres</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ko, William</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The dynamics of the world's oceans occur at a vast range of length scales. Although there are theories that aid in understanding the dynamics at planetary scales and microscales, the motions in between are still not yet well understood. This work discusses a numerical model to study barotropic wind-driven gyre flow that is capable of resolving dynamics at the synoptic, O(1000 km), mesoscale, O(100 km) and submesoscales O(10 km). The Quasi-Geostrophic (QG) model has been used predominantly to study ocean circulations but it is limited as it can only describe motions at synoptic scales and mesoscales. The Rotating Shallow Water (SW) model that can describe dynamics at a wider range of horizontal length scales and can better describe motions at the submesoscales. Numerical methods that are capable of high-resolution simulations are discussed for both QG and SW models and the numerical results are compared. To achieve high accuracy and resolve an optimal range of length scales, spectral methods are applied to solve the governing equations and a third-order Adams-Bashforth method is used for the temporal discretization. Several simulations of both models are computed by varying the strength of dissipation. The simulations either tend to a laminar steady state, or a turbulent flow with dynamics occurring at a wide range of length and time scales. The laminar results show similar behaviours in both models, thus QG and SW tend to agree when describing slow, large-scale flows. The turbulent simulations begin to differ as QG breaks down when faster and smaller scale motions occur. Essential differences in the underlying assumptions between the QG and SW models are highlighted using the results from the numerical simulations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Inverse Partial Fluorescence Yield Spectroscopy</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Achkar, Andrew</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful probe of electronic and spatial structure that has been at the heart of many advances in physics, biology, chemistry, engineering and the earth sciences. Unfortunately, the existing experimental techniques are subject to fundamental limitations that complicate the interpretation of x-ray absorption spectra in many important cases. These limitations have motivated an effort to develop an alternative measure of the absorption cross-section that is not subject to the same set of limitations. In this thesis, a technique known as inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) is described which addresses this problem. IPFY differs from existing approaches in a significant way — by using an energy-discriminating photon detector, one gains access to fluorescence information from both resonant and non-resonant x-ray emission processes. We will show that the non-resonant emission is fundamentally related to the total absorption cross-section of a material through an inverse relation. This will be proven by extension of the general theory of fluorescence yield for the case of a thick, homogeneous specimen. We will also demonstrate the utility of IPFY with measurements of NiO, NdGaO₃, LNSCO, and stainless steel 304 at soft and intermediate x-ray energies. These experiments will highlight some essential features of IPFY spectroscopy and demonstrate how it can be an invaluable tool when the other experimental techniques fail to provide reliable spectra. We will also demonstrate how one can exploit the geometry dependence of IPFY to quantitatively determine the composition of a sample and the total x-ray absorption coefficient. Additionally, we will consider the special cases of multilayers and powder specimens, where the theory of fluorescence yield requires approximations and is not as well-behaved as in thick, homogenous specimens. Ultimately, these experiments and theoretical developments will be used to support the claim that IPFY is a bulk sensitive measure of the total x-ray absorption coefficient. Moreover, we will show that IPFY is not affected by saturation effects, is insensitive to surface contamination layers and provides reliable spectra even for strongly insulating materials. These properties make IPFY a suitable spectroscopic technique for studying XAS in a wide range of materials.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>¹H MAS NMR Spectral Coalescence of Water and Hydroxyl Resonances in MCM-41</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Walia, Jaspreet</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Solid state ¹H MAS NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate the temperature and hydration dependance of water and hydroxyl proton spectra of hydrated mesoporous MCM-41. The NMR spectra show a complex peak structure, with hydroxyl proton resonances seen in dry MCM-41 disappearing as water is introduced into the pores, and new peaks appearing representing water and hydrated silanol groups. Until now the assignment of these peaks was unclear and the consensus was that magnetization exchange played an important role in the coalescence of the various peaks which appear in the spectra. It was found recently that magnetization exchange is not necessary to produce the spectral featured observed [Niknam, M., M.Sc. Thesis, University of Waterloo (2010)]. In the present study a simplified model, based on chemical shift averaging by the making and breaking of hydrogen bonds as water undergoes rotational motion and translational self-diffusion on the pore surface, has been developed to explain the NMR spectral results. The model is able to reproduce the experimental ¹H MAS NMR spectra for all hydrations and temperatures studied. For the first time, definitive spectral assignments for all hydroxyl and water protons in the sample has been achieved. Spectral features arising due to temperature change have been explained by using the known result that the proton chemical shift of a hydrogen atom involved in hydrogen bonding varies linearly with temperature. Furthermore, it is reported for the first time, that with increasing hydration, water molecules begin to favour forming two hydrogen bonds to the surface. This may represent the first step in the pore filling process.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Optical Pulse Shaping For Chirped Pulse Interferometry And Bio-Imaging</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Schreiter, Kurt</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Biomedical imaging requires high resolution to see the fine features of a sample and fast acquisition to observe live cells that move. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a powerful technique which uses optical interference for non-invasive high resolution 3D imaging in biological samples. The resolution of OCT is determined by the length over which the light used will in- terfere. Unfortunately, dispersion hurts the imaging resolution by broadening interference features. A technique called quantum-OCT (QOCT)[1] is immune to dispersion but re- quires entangled photon pairs. The need for entanglement drastically reduces the number of photons available for imaging, making QOCT too slow to be practical. Chirped-pulse interferometry (CPI) is also immune to dispersion. A chirped pulse is one where the fre- quency, or colour, of the light changes from red to blue from one end of the pulse to the other. CPI relies on frequency correlations created by applying different chirps to two sep- arate pulses. This method had the disadvantage of being limited to a single predetermined chirp rate, and discarded 50% of the power. However CPI has better resolution than OCT, automatic dispersion cancellation, and 10,000,000 times the signal strength of QOCT [13]. A new, much more flexible and efficient method of CPI will be demonstrated by creating the frequency correlations entirely in a single pulse. This new method is referred to as non- linear chirped pulse interferometry (NL-CPI). The non-linear chirp required in NCPI is very difficult to produce using only conven- tional optics. In this thesis we document the construction and characterization of a new method of creating the desired chirp using a programmable pulse-shaper (PS). We build a PPS and then demonstrated its functionality by compressing a 105nm FWHM bandwidth pulse to under 17f s, near its transform limited time duration. We also show that the values given to the PPS for dispersion are accurate by calculating and then compensating the dispersion caused by various optical elements in the CPI interferometer. Conventional OCT systems are immune to dispersion common to both arms of the interferometer. Non-linear interferometers experience broadening due to this dispersion, making them more difficult to use with fibre based interferometers common in conventional OCT. We show that NL-CPI can compensate for dispersion common to both arms of the interferometer, making NL-CPI more appealing as a replacement for conventional OCT. In this thesis we experimentally implement and demonstrate a prototype setup using non-linear CPI for dispersion-cancelled imaging of a mirror, with a resolution comparable to conventional OCT systems. We then use the system to produce 2-D cross sectional images of a biological sample, an onion. Q-OCT has previously been used to image an onion[16], but required treating the onion with gold nano particles to achieve a useful signal. The onion we used had no special treatment. In addition our axial scanning rate is also 10000 times faster than Q-OCT.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Silicon-Integrated Two-Dimensional Phononic Band Gap Quasi-Crystal Architecture</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Norris, Ryan Christopher</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The development and fabrication of silicon-based phononic band gap crystals has been gaining interest since phononic band gap crystals have implications in fundamental science and display the potential for application in engineering by providing a relatively new platform for the realization of sensors and signal processing elements. The seminal study of phononic band gap phenomenon for classical elastic wave localization in structures with periodicity in two- or three-physical dimensions occurred in the early 1990’s. Micro-integration of silicon devices that leverage this phenomenon followed from the mid-2000’s until the present. The reported micro-integration relies on exotic piezoelectric transduction, phononic band gap crystals that are etched into semi-infinite or finite-thickness slabs which support surface or slab waves, phononic band gap crystals of numerous lattice constants in dimension and phononic band gap crystal truncation by homogeneous mediums or piezoelectric transducers. The thesis reports, to the best of the author's knowledge, for the first time, the theory, design methodology and experiment of an electrostatically actuated silicon-plate phononic band gap quasi-crystal architecture, which may serve as a platform for the development of a new generation of silicon-integrated sensors, signal processing elements and improved mechanical systems. Electrostatic actuation mitigates the utilization of piezoelectric transducers and provides action at a distance type forces so that the phononic band gap quasi-crystal edges may be free standing for potentially reduced anchor and substrate mode loss and improved energy confinement compared with traditional surface and slab wave phononic band gap crystals. The proposed phononic band gap quasi-crystal architecture is physically scaled for fabrication as MEMS in a silicon-on-insulator process. Reasonable experimental verification of the model of the electrostatically actuated phononic band gap quasi-crystal architecture is obtained through extensive dynamic harmonic analysis and mode shape topography measurements utilizing optical non-destructive laser-Doppler velocimetry. We have utilized our devices to obtain fundamental information regarding novel transduction mechanisms and behavioral characteristics of the phononic band gap quasi-crystal architecture. Applicability of the phononic band gap quasi-crystal architecture to physical temperature sensors is demonstrated experimentally. Vibration stabilized resonators are demonstrated numerically.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Porous Media Thermoacoustic Stacks: Measurements and Models</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tasnim, Syeda Humaira</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The present research analyzes random porous thermoacoustic stack systems analytically, experimentally, and numerically with a primary objective to develop a comprehensive analytical porous media modeling for random porous (such as Reticulated Vitreous Carbon (RVC) foams) environment. Mathematical models are developed for flow, thermal, and energy fields within the random porous medium stack. The Darcy and Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended Darcy models are used for modeling the momentum equation and local thermal equilibrium assumption between the porous matrix and trapped fluid in the void space for energy equation. The expressions of temperature, energy flux density, and acoustic work absorbed or produced by a thermoacoustic device are compared with existing literature and observed good agreements. After obtaining the flow and thermal fields’ information, the present study examines the entropy generation distribution within the stack. One important item revealed in this study is that entropy generation inside the porous medium completely follows the trend of the imaginary part of Rott’s first function profile. Another major contribution of this research is to identify the location of maximum entropy generation which is identical to the location of maximum thermoacoustic heat and work transport. The expression of Nusselt number for steady flow cannot be used in oscillatory random porous medium because of the phase difference between the temperature gradient at the wall and the temperature difference between the wall and the space averaged temperature. The present research experimentally examines novel stack configuration by considering “alternating conducting and insulating materials” as stack in thermoacoustic devices. The objective of considering such stack arrangement is to reduce the conduction heat transfer loss from the hot end of the stack to the cold end, thereby increasing the performance of the stack. Eight different heterogeneous stack arrangements are studied in this research. The performance of the heterogeneous stack arrangement is compared with the typical homogeneous stacks. This research shows that heterogeneous stacks can be used in thermoacoustic devices particularly in small (millimeter) scale thermoacoustic devices. Numerically the present study investigates the influence of working fluid, geometric, and operating conditions on stack performance by solving the full Navier-Stokes, mass, energy equation, and equation of state.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Robust Time-Optimal Control for the One-Dimensional Optical Lattice for Quantum Computation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Khani, Botan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Quantum information is a growing field showing exciting possibilities for computational speed-up and communications. For the successful implementation of quantum computers, high-precision control is required to reach fault-tolerant thresholds. Control of quantum systems pertains to the manipulation of states and their evolution. In order to minimize the effects of the environment on the control operations of the qubits, control pulses should be made time-optimal. In addition, control pulses should be made robust to noise in the system, dispersion in energies and coupling elements, and uncertain parameters. In this thesis, we examine a robust time-optimal gradient ascent technique which is used to develop controls of the motional degrees of freedom for an ensemble of neutral atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice in the high dispersion regime with shallow trapping potentials. As such, the system is analyzed in the delocalized basis. The system is treated as an ensemble of atoms with a range of possible quasimomenta across the first Brillouin zone. This gives the ensemble of Hamiltonians, indexed by the quasimomenta, a distinct spectra in their motional states and highly inhomogeneous control Hamiltonians. Thus, the optical lattice is seen as a model system for robust control. We find optimized control pulses designed using an ensemble modification of gradient-ascent pulse engineering robust to any range of quasimomentum. We show that it is possible to produce rotation controls with fidelities above 90\% for half of the first Brillouin zone with gate times in the order of several free oscillations. This is possible for a spectrum that shows upwards of 75\% dispersion in the energies of the band structure. We also show that NOT controls for qubit rotations on the entire Brillouin zone fidelities above 99\% were possible for 0.6\% dispersion in energies. The gate times were also in the order of several free oscillations. It is shown that these solutions are palindromic in time due to phase differences in some of the energy couplings when comparing one half of the Brillouin zone to another. We explore the limits of discretized sampling of a continuous ensemble for control.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hybrid Spectral Ray Tracing Method for Multi-scale Millimeter-wave and Photonic Propagation Problems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hailu, Daniel</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents an efficient self-consistent Hybrid Spectral Ray Tracing (HSRT) technique for analysis and design of multi-scale sub-millimeter wave problems, where sub-wavelength features are modeled using rigorous methods, and complex structures with dimensions in the order of tens or even hundreds of wavelengths are modeled by asymptotic methods. Quasi-optical devices are used in imaging arrays for sub-millimeter and terahertz applications, THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), high-speed wireless communications, and space applications to couple terahertz radiation from space to a hot electron bolometer. These devices and structures, as physically small they have become, are very large in terms of the wavelength of the driving quasi-optical sources and may have dimension in the tens or even hundreds of wavelengths. Simulation and design optimization of these devices and structures is an extremely challenging electromagnetic problem. The analysis of complex electrically large unbounded wave structures using rigorous methods such as method of moments (MoM), finite element method (FEM), and finite difference time domain (FDTD) method can become almost impossible due to the need for large computational resources. Asymptotic high-frequency techniques are used for analysis of electrically large quasi-optical systems and hybrid methods for solving multi-scale problems. Spectral Ray Tracing (SRT) has a number of unique advantages as a candidate for hybridization. The SRT method has the advantages of Spectral Theory of Diffraction (STD). STD can model reflection, refraction and diffraction of an arbitrary wave incident on the complex structure, which is not the case for diffraction theories such as Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD), Uniform theory of Diffraction (UTD) and Uniform Asymptotic Theory (UAT). By including complex rays, SRT can effectively analyze both near-fields and far-fields accurately with minimal approximations. In this thesis, a novel matrix representation of SRT is presented that uses only one spectral integration per observation point and applied to modeling a hemispherical and hyper-hemispherical lens. The hybridization of SRT with commercially available FEM and MoM software is proposed in this work to solve the complexity of multi-scale analysis. This yields a computationally efficient self-consistent HSRT algorithm. Various arrangements of the Hybrid SRT method such as FEM-SRT, and MoM-SRT, are investigated and validated through comparison of radiation patterns with Ansoft HFSS for the FEM method, FEKO for MoM, Multi-level Fast Multipole Method (MLFMM) and physical optics. For that a bow-tie terahertz antenna backed by hyper-hemispherical silicon lens, an on-chip planar dipole fabricated in SiGe:C BiCMOS technology and attached to a hyper-hemispherical silicon lens and a double-slot antenna backed by silica lens will be used as sample structures to be analyzed using the HSRT. Computational performance (memory requirement, CPU/GPU time) of developed algorithm is compared to other methods in commercially available software. It is shown that the MoM-SRT, in its present implementation, is more accurate than MoM-PO but comparable in speed. However, as shown in this thesis, MoM-SRT can take advantage of parallel processing and GPU. The HSRT algorithm is applied to simulation of on-chip dipole antenna backed by Silicon lens and integrated with a 180-GHz VCO and radiation pattern compared with measurements. The radiation pattern is measured in a quasi-optical configuration using a power detector. In addition, it is shown that the matrix formulation of SRT and HSRT are promising approaches for solving complex electrically large problems with high accuracy. This thesis also expounds on new measurement setup specifically developed for measuring integrated antennas, radiation pattern and gain of the embedded on-chip antenna in the mmW/ terahertz range. In this method, the radiation pattern is first measured in a quasi-optical configuration using a power detector. Subsequently, the radiated power is estimated form the integration over the radiation pattern. Finally, the antenna gain is obtained from the measurement of a two-antenna system.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Highly Efficient Planar Antenna System Based on the Planar Waveguide Technology for Low Cost Millimeter-Wave Applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Abdel Wahab, Wael</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis investigates the integration of planar antennas, such as Dielectric Resonator Antennas (DRAs) to the planar waveguide structure, specifically the Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) for high radiation efficiency millimeter-wave (mm-wave) applications. The SIW is a low cost and low loss technology, since it almost keeps the guided wave inside the structure. Therefore, it is an excellent candidate feeding scheme compared to traditional planar (multi-conductor) structures, such as the Microstrip Line (MSL) and Co-planar Waveguide (CPW) for many planar antennas. It enhances the antenna???s overall radiation efficiency by minimizing the conduction loss, which dominates at the mm-wave frequency band. For this thesis, two different SIW-integrated DRA configurations operating at mm-wave frequency band are presented. The rectangular DRA is excited in its fundamental mode TE??11 for radiation through a narrow slot cut on the SIW broad wall. However, the coupling slot itself is excited by the SIW TE10 fundamental mode. In addition, the design guidelines, and a parametric study is also conducted on the proposed antenna parameters to investigate their impact on the antenna???s overall performance including the reflection coefficient and radiation pattern (gain). The results are provided within this thesis. The antenna is made of low cost and low loss materials that are available commercially. It is fabricated by using a novel and simple technique, which is compatible with the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) technology. The board is treated as multi-layers composed of the SIW-layer, and DRA element(s) layer, respectively. The fabricated antenna prototypes are tested to demonstrate their validity for real microwave/mm-wave applications. Their reflection coefficients and radiation patterns are measured, and the antenna shows a boresight gain of 5.51 dB and a radiation efficiency of more than 90 % over the operating frequency band of 33-40 GHz. Antenna arrays based on the SIW integrated DRA are investigated for high gain/radiation efficiency applications. Different array configurations such as, linear (series-fed and corporate-fed) and two-dimensional (2D) arrays are presented. The series-fed DRA array is characterized by a single SIW line loaded by DRA-slot pairs, whereas the SIW-power splitter is used to form the corporate-fed DRA array, when loaded by DRA-slot pairs. While the SIW hybrid-feeding scheme (series-feed combined with corporate-feed) is used to form 2D DRA arrays. In this design, the SIW-power splitter is used to split the power equally and in-phase among the sets (rows) of SIW series fed-DRA elements (columns). A simple and generic Transmission Line (T.L.) circuit model is proposed to simplify and expedite the antenna array design process. It is used to calculate the antenna reflection coefficient and radiation pattern (gain). The T.L. model does not take the mutual coupling between the DRA elements into account, since our study shows that its less than -20 dB over the operating bandwidth. However, it is useful and faster than full-wave solvers, such as HFSS, which consumes time and memory due to the huge generated mesh. The developed T.L. circuit model is used to design the antenna array and study the impact of its main designed parameters on the antenna performance. The developed antenna array T.L. model leads to a general design methodology (guidelines). It also allows for optimum array designs for a given set of performance requirements and to have more physical insight into the SIW technology based antenna systems for mm-wave bands. The designed antenna array samples are fabricated and tested within the operating frequency band 33-40 GHz. The series-fed antenna array shows a measured boresight gain of 11.70 dB, and high radiation efficiency, which is more than 90 % over an operating frequency band of 4%. Furthermore, the measured results are compared to these calculated by the proposed T.L. circuit model and full-wave solver. A good agreement between the measured and the HFSS results are observed, especially near the frequency at which the reflection coefficient is minimum. However, some deviation is noticed between the proposed circuit model and the measured results. This deviation is attributed to the discrete nature of the SIW structure that affects the Short Circuit (SC) performance (magnitude and phase), the T.L. lengths, and the mutual coupling between any two adjacent antenna elements. All these issues are handled efficiently and are taken into account by the full-wave solver. Therefore, the measured reflection coefficient agrees with that of the HFSS, except for a very small deviation, caused by the fabrication tolerances and measurement errors. However, the proposed T.L. circuit model is still valid and can easily predict and estimate the resonance behavior and the impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna arrays in a very short time compared with the full-wave solver.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Stability and Hopf Bifurcation Analysis of Hopfield Neural Networks with a General Distribution of Delays</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jessop, Raluca</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We investigate the linear stability and perform the bifurcation analysis for Hopfield neural networks with a general distribution of delays, where the neurons are identical. We start by analyzing the scalar model and show what kind of information can be gained with only minimal information about the exact distribution of delays. We determine a mean delay and distribution independent stability region. We then illustrate a way of improving on this conservative result by approximating the true region of stability when the actual distribution is not known, but some moments or cumulants of the distribution are. We compare the approximate stability regions with the stability regions in the case of the uniform and gamma distributions. We show that, in general, the approximations improve as more moments or cumulants are used, and that the approximations using cumulants give better results than the ones using moments. Further, we extend these results to a network of n identical neurons, where we examine the stability of a symmetrical equilibrium point via the analysis of the characteristic equation both when the connection matrix is symmetric and when it is not. Finally, for the scalar model, we show under what conditions a Hopf bifurcation occurs and we use the centre manifold technique to determine the criticality of the bifurcation. When the kernel represents the gamma distribution with p=1 and p=2, we transform the delay differential equation into a system of ordinary differential equations and we compare the centre manifold computation to the one we obtain in the ordinary differential case.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hybrid Organic/Inorganic Optical Upconversion Devices</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chen, Jun</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The widely available charge coupled device (CCD) and lately CMOS imaging devices have created many applications on a mass scale. However these devices are limited to wavelengths shorter than about 1 μm. Hybrid photon upconversion devices have been developed recently. The end goal is to achieve an alternative technology for imaging in the 1.5-μm region. The hybrid upconversion idea relies on the integration of a photodetector and an organic light emitting diode (OLED). Under a forward bias for the OLED, the detected signal in the Photodetector is sent to the OLED, resulting in an increase in emission at a shorter wavelength and therefore achieving optical up conversion. An OLED device can simply consists of a stack of anode, a hole transport layer (HTL), a light-emitting layer, an electron transport layer (ETL), a cathode layer, and it typically emits visible light. As each organic molecule is a topologically perfect structure, the growth of each organic layer does not require “lattice matching”, which has been the fundamental limit for inorganic semiconductor monolithic devices. Thus, integration of an OLED with a III–V compound semiconductor is a highly feasible and desirable approach for making low-cost, large-area, potentially high efficiency devices. This thesis addresses the physics, fabrication and characterization of hybrid near infrared optical upconverters and their imaging application. Firstly, one novel hybrid optical upconverter structure is presented, which substantially improves the upconversion efficiency by embedding a metal mirror. Efficient carrier injection from the inorganic photodetector to the OLED is achieved by the insertion of a thin Au metal embedded mirror at the inorganic-organic interface. The upconversion efficiency was improved by more than 100%. Secondly, the overall upconversion efficiency can be increased significantly, by introducing a gain mechanism into the Photodetector section of the upconverter. A promising option to implement gain is a heterojunction phototransistor (HPT). An InGaAs-InP HPT was integrated with an OLED, which converts 1.5-μm Infrared light to visible light with a built-in electrical gain (~94). The overall upconversion efficiency was improved to be 1.55 W/W. Thirdly, this upconversion approach can also be used to realize a pixelless imaging device. A pixelless hybrid upconversion device consists of a large-area single-mesa device, where the OLED output is spatially correlated with the input 1.5-µm scene. Only the parts receiving incoming photons will emit output photons. To achieve this functionality, photon-generated carriers must flow mainly along the layer-growth direction when injected from the InGaAs light absorption layer into OLED light emission layer. A prototype of pixelless imaging device based on an i-In0.53Ga0.47As/C60 heterojunction was demonstrated, which minimized lateral current spreading. This thesis presents experimental results of the first organic/inorganic hybrid optical amplifer and the first hybrid near infrared imaging device.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Semiquinone-Bridged bis-Dithiazolyls as Neutral Radical Conductors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yu, Xin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Radicals are potential building blocks to prepare conductive and magnetic materials. In order to achieve high conductivity, materials displaying a large bandwidth W and a low on-site Coulomb repulsion energy U must be generated. Semiquinone-bridged bis-1,2,3-dithiazolyl radicals (R = Cl, Ph, Me and the MeCN adduct of R = Cl) represent a new family of resonance stabilized neutral radical for use in the design of single-component conductive materials were prepared and fully characterized. In solid state these radicals remain as unassociated (monomers) in the solid state and typically form superimposed alternating π-stacks or slipped π-stacks, arranged in several different space groups. The predominate intermolecular interactions are S•••N′ and / or S•••O′ contacts, which increase the dimensionality from one dimensional π-stacked systems (i.e., poor lateral overlap) to two dimensional systems in the solid state. Thus the semiquinone-bridged bis-dithiazolyl radicals exhibit a significant decrease in activation energy (ca. 0.1 – 0.2 eV) and the conductivity is two to three orders of magnitude (ca. σ ≈ 1E-5 – 1E-2 S / cm) higher in comparison to the previously reported pyridine based systems. This high conductivity is attributed to the low on-site Coulomb repulsion energies (U) which were estimated from the solution cell potentials (EPC) obtained from CV measurements and improved bandwidth (W) from the S•••N′ and / or S•••O′ interactions. Furthermore, the all sulphur containing semiquinone-bridged bis-dithiazolyls have the lowest activation energies and the highest conductivity under ambient conditions compared with other all sulfur nitrogen based radicals known to date. The semiquinone-bridged bis-dithiazolyl (R = Cl) orderes as spin-canted antiferromagnets, TN = 8 K, and displayed large coercivity (80 Oe). The ZFC-FC measurement at low field (i.e., H = 100 Oe) established the phase transition temperatures and the spontaneous magnetization was used to estimate the spin canting angles (~ 0.14°). In the case of R = Ph, the antiparallel alignment of the ferromagnetic coupled chains leads to a spin-canted antiferromagnet (TN = 4.5 K), which undergo a unique field induced spin flop transition. The MeCN solvated of R = Cl behaves as a simple paramagnet at room temperature with bulk antiferromagnetic interactions, but no observed magnetic ordering from 2-300 K.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Ring Resonators for Integrated Optics Applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gad, Michael</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Integrated ring resonators have attracted a considerable interest in optical communications because of their small size and wide range of applicability. Here we consider several aspects of these devices, beginning with a tunable hybrid ring resonators consisting of a silicon over insulator (SOI) ring covered with a polymer layer in a variable electric field. Varying the field changes the polymer refractive index and consequently the resonance condition of the cavity. This device offers a large degree of optical confinement together with a high modulation speed. Subsequently, we design and present fabrication results for a Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) multiplexer/demultiplexer formed from a series of ring resonators with two channels separated by 50 GHz each that is predicted to exhibit a free spectral range (FSR) of 100 GHz , signal dispersion less than 30 ps/nm and a signal cross-talk less than -23 dB. Finally, we analyze the application of the coupled ring waveguide circuit to rotation sensors based on the Sagnac phase shift. Here, however our analysis indicates that a single ring, of the same area exhibits a higher degree of sensitivity to rotational motion than a multiple ring circuit.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Energy Shaping for Systems with Two Degrees of Underactuation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ng, Wai Man</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis we are going to study the energy shaping problem on controlled Lagrangian systems with degree of underactuation less than or equal to two. Energy shaping is a method of stabilization by designing a suitable feedback control force on the given controlled Lagrangian system so that the total energy of the feedback equivalent system has a non-degenerate minimum at the equilibrium. The feedback equivalent system can then be stabilized by a further dissipative force. Finding a feedback equivalent system requires solving a system of PDEs. The existence of solutions for this system of PDEs is guaranteed, under some conditions, in the case of one degree of underactuation. Higher degrees of underactuation, however, requires a more careful study on the system of PDEs, and we apply the formal theory of PDEs to achieve this purpose in the case of two degrees of underactuation. The thesis is divided into four chapters. First, we review the basic notion of energy shaping and state the results for the case of one degree of underactuation. We then devise a general scheme to solve the energy shaping problem with degree of underactuation equal to one, together with some examples to illustrate the general procedure. After that we review the tools from the formal theory of PDEs, as a preparation for solving the problem with two degrees of underactuation. We derive an equivalent involutive system of PDEs from which we can deduce the existence of solutions which suit the energy shaping requirement.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>NDT Applications for the Assessment of Asphalt Pavements, Plate Thickness, and Steel-Grout Coupling</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wu, Yen Chieh</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Nondestructive testing (NDT) uses different wave propagation modes to evaluate the internal structure of materials, revealing internal damage such as corrosion and fracturing that cannot be detected by traditional methods. Civil infrastructures are considered high priority assets in Ontario and Canada because of their value, high consequence of failure, and the continual influence of aging effects. Unexpected failure of infrastructure not only costs more than planned replacements but also results in increased safety risks. The in-situ condition assessment of civil infrastructure is critical for the successful implementation of maintenance and safety programs. Therefore, reliable nondestructive methods of inspection are required for the implementation of economical and efficient maintenance and asset management programs. Continuing technological developments in data collection, acquisition equipment, and data processing techniques have provided useful applications of nondestructive methods in many engineering fields. Among the many applications, this research study examines three applications of nondestructive testing in civil engineering: (1) condition assessment of construction joints in asphalt pavements, (2) average thickness evaluation of steel pipes, and (3) void and debonding detection in grouted steel tanks. The study on asphalt focuses on the improvement of the coupling system between the transducers and the asphalt surface, and the development of a new data processing technique to reduce user input and increase the reliability of the condition assessment of longitudinal joints. The current wavelet transmission coefficient (WTC) method requires user input, making the automatic data processing difficult. In the WTC method, the coupling between the transducers and the asphalt surface requires the use of epoxy and aluminum plates. This procedure is not practical for testing in-service roads. A new coupling mechanism using polyurethane foam to provide a spring action on the transducers and calibrated weights to generate a compression force was developed and showed good results, reducing the testing time by up to 50%. A new and robust data analysis methodology, called instantaneous transmission coefficient (ITC), is proposed based on measured instantaneous frequencies and damping ratios. The main advantage of the ITC procedure is that it can be performed automatically, reducing user input. A laboratory scale asphalt slab is used to evaluate the new methodology. Results show good agreement between the WTC and ITC measurements for both jointed and joint-free areas. The second study investigates the feasibility of the multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) technique for the evaluation of the average wall thickness of steel pipes. Electromagnetic NDT methods, such as the eddy current and the remote field testing, are common tools for thickness measurement of conductive materials. However, these methods give only localized results where measurements are made, making the process time consuming and inaccurate for assessing the full cross-sectional area of the pipe. Lamb waves have been used previously in the evaluation of steel pipes; however, the existing techniques require prior calibration to a theoretical wave mode, and their accuracy decreases with the length of the pipe evaluated due to wave attenuation effects. Preliminary results show the capability of the MASW test for providing reliable thickness information. The measured dispersion curves include information of fundamental modes and the higher modes, providing an improved characterization of the medium. Thicknesses between 3.2 mm and 12.7 mm are tested with an error of less than 2%. The third study explores the detection of voids in a steel tank filled with lightweight grout. A joint analysis of surface waves and Lamb waves is used for void detection and the identification of debonding conditions in a laboratory scale model of a steel tank filled with grout. Different configurations of the MASW method are conducted using an instrumented hammer (large wavelengths, 10 cm &lt; λ &lt; 25 cm) and a 50 kHz piezoelectric transmitter (small wavelengths, 5 cm &lt; λ &lt; 9 cm) as sources. The attenuation coefficient computed from the Fourier spectra of the measured signals indicates that the presence of a void has an effect on the propagation of the wave. The comparison between experimental and theoretical dispersion curves show that mainly Lamb waves are generated during the testing of the steel tank; thus, detecting the debonding conditions between the steel plate and the grout. Lamb modes are used successfully for detecting the presence of a void beneath the steel wall. The laboratory measurements are effective in the detection of the void, showing amplitudes up to 50% higher, likely because the deformation of the wall is attenuated by the grout.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Investigation of Mixing Models and Finite Volume Conditional Moment Closure Applied to Autoignition of Hydrogen Jets</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Buckrell, Andrew James Michael</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the present work, the processes of steady combustion and autoignition of hydrogen are investigated using the Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) model with a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code. A study of the effects on the flowfield of changing turbulence model constants, specifically the turbulent Schmidt number, Sct, and C epsilon 1 of the k − epsilon model, are investigated. The effects of two different mixing models are explored: the AMC model, which is commonly used in CMC implementations, and a model based on the assumption of inhomogeneous turbulence. The background equations required for implementation of the CMC model are presented, and all relevant closures are discussed. The numerical implementation of the CMC model, in addition to other techniques aimed at reducing computational expense of the CMC calculations, are provided. The CMC equation is discretised using finite volume (FV) method. The CFD and CMC calculations are fully coupled, allowing for simulations of steady flames or flame development after the occurrence of autoignition. Through testing of a steady jet flame, it is observed that the flowfield calculations follow typical k − epsilon model trends, with an overprediction of spreading and an underprediction of penetration. The CMC calculations are observed to perform well, providing good agreement with experimental measurements. Autoignition simulations are conducted for 3 different cases of turbulence constants and 7 different coflow temperatures to determine the final effect on the steady flowfield. In comparison to the standard constants, reduction of Sct results in a reduction of the centreline mixing intensity within the flowfield and a corresponding reduction of ignition length, while reducing C 1 results in an increase of centreline mixing intensity and an increase in the ignition length. All scenarios tested result in an underprediction of ignition length in comparison to experimental results; however, good agreement with the experimental trends is achieved. At low coflow temperatures, the effects of mixing intensity within the flowfield are seen to have the largest influence on ignition length, while at high coflow temperatures, the chemical source term in the CMC equation increases in magnitude, resulting in very little difference between predictions for different sets of turbulence constants. The inhomogeneous mixing model is compared using the standard turbulence constants. A reduction of ignition lengths in comparison to the AMC model is observed. In steady state simulation of the autoigniting flow, the inhomogeneous model is observed to predict both lifted flames and fully anchored flames, depending on coflow temperature.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Theoretical study of non-relativistic electron dynamics under intense laser fields</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Long, Zijian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Strong field approximation (SFA) is the most important approximation in the analytical theory of intense laser matter interaction. Based on SFA many analytical theories have been developed such that a broad spectrum of strong field physics phenomena can be described. The central idea of SFA-based theories is to approximate the electron propagation in the continuum by the Gordon-Volkov wavefunction - a well studied analytical solution to the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation where the electron is driven by the laser field only. This approximation captures some of the essential features of strong-field physics, but at the same time causes several problems in the theory. In this thesis a comprehensive study of the SFA has been presented. We introduce the SFA in both the length gauge and the velocity gauge. The adequacy of SFA has been discussed by comparing the theory to the numerical solution to the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation (TDSE). The numerical method of solving TDSE is presented as a separate chapter. In order to obtain a better understanding of the applicability of SFA-based theory, we tested the major approximations in the theory by using three different models: the zero-range potential, the hydrogen atom and the hydrogen molecular ion. The accuracy of the method of steepest descent (MSD) and other major approximations in the analytical theory have also been examined. Targeting at the generalization of the SFA-based theories, several extensions and improvements of SFA have been proposed. We will review them in detail and bring them into unity. One of the most successful aspect of the SFA-based theories is to describe and decompose electron dynamics into components such that identification of different physical processes becomes possible. For instance, the direct ionization and non-sequential double ionization bear clear definitions only within the SFA-based framework. The physical interpretation becomes more straight forward due to the fact that there is a close connection between the quantum orbital and classical trajectory. The MSD is a mathematical tool to bridge the quantum orbital and the classical trajectory in an SFA-based theory. We will discuss MSD within a systematic framework so that the higher order asymptotic expansion terms can be obtained in a straight forward way. After gaining substantial understanding of the SFA and the MSD we developed a graphic user interface (GUI) software that is capable of calculating strong field ionization rates, photo-electron spectra and high harmonic generation spectra. The software interface and algorithms have been presented in the thesis. Sample calculations were done and compared with the previously obtained results. In the last chapter of the thesis, we further developed the theory to describe a two-laser ionization scheme where one laser is chosen to be resonantly coupled two real states and the other is a strong few-cycle laser pulse. We demonstrate the periodic dependence of the total ionization on the appearance time of the strong few-cycle laser pulse. In the case of few-cycle pulses with lower intensity, we observed side-bands in the photoelectron spectrum, whose intensity vary periodically with the appearance time of the pulse. We show that our extended theory is able to explain these phenomena adequately.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Characterization and Analysis of Continuous Wave Terahertz Photomixers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Khabiri, Mehrnoosh</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In recent years, Terahertz (THz) technology has become a very active field of research in regards to its wide range of potential applications such as biosensing, biomedical imaging, pharmaceutical, security, and many others. There are different methods to generate THz radiation. Photomixing is one of the Continuous Wave (CW) THz generation methods in which the output of two single-mode lasers or the output of a dual-mode laser with different center frequencies are combined in a nonlinear medium such as photoconductors or superconductors. The photomixing system is designed such that the difference of the laser frequencies falls in the THz range. The generated THz wave can be coupled to an integrated antenna or waveguide. The CW THz photomixer sources are potentially compact, low cost, low power consuming, coherent, and highly tunable. However, the primary disadvantage of using photomixers is that the output power is relatively low compared with other THz sources. Photomixer modeling requires solving both semiconductor and electromagnetic problems. In contrast to most of the researches which only report either experimental results or simple analytical model to characterize the photomixers, in this research, a computational simulation method is presented to analyze and model the photomixer devices. The proposed computational method combines a semiconductor solver and a full-wave electromagnetic simulator to rigorously analyze and optimize an integrated THz photomixer antenna device. In this method, by solving Maxwell’s equations and then the drift-diffusion charge carrier transport model, the generated THz photo-current inside the photomixer device is obtained. This THz photo-current is modeled as a current source in the antenna feed to find the radiated THz power. Using the proposed simulation method the effects of photomixer parameters on the THz photo-current and radiated power is accurately investigated and the results of a parametric study on various parameters such as carrier lifetime of material, incident optical power density, applied bias voltage, the THz beat frequency, and the gap size are presented.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An experimental investigation of the spin dynamics of dipolar spin ice</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yaraskavitch, Luke Richard</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The low temperature spin dynamics of the canonical dipolar spin ice materials is examined. The ac susceptibility of dipolar spin ice materials Ho2Ti2O7 and Dy2Ti2O7 is measured to lower temperatures and frequencies than previous studies. This provides a probe of the dynamics of fractionalized magnetic excitations which have been found to exist and interact as monopole-like particles within the spin ice con guration. Low temperatures and low frequencies access the dilute monopole phase, and provide a valuable stress case scenario to theory which has been used to describe the system to date. The relaxation is found to be well described at the lowest temperatures by an Arrhenius law with single energy barrier for both Ho2Ti2O7 and Dy2Ti2O7, with similar barriers to relaxation, 10.7 K and 9.79 K respectively. It is also revealed to be distinctly different from predictions of the dipolar spin ice model, based upon simulations of both a Coulomb gas and dipolar spin ice on the pyrochlore lattice. These simulations, as well as calculations based on Debye-Huckel theory, do not see Arrhenius behaviour in our temperature range, and do not predict the rate at which dynamics freeze out. It is not currently understood what would be required in order to amend this. The implications for thermal methods of probing spin dynamics is discussed, as well as how this measurement impacts the magnetolyte theory of spin ice. Brief reports are presented in the appendices of specific heat measurements of three spin liquid candidates: Yb2Ti2O7, Tb2Ti2O7, and Pr2Hf2O7. In Yb2Ti2O7, measurements of three single crystals, two unique features, a broad anomaly at 195 mK and sharp peak at 265 mK, are found which seem to comprise elements of previous single crystal and polycrystalline measurements. These low temperature features do not correspond to changes in neutron scattering intensity at 400 mK. In Tb2Ti2O7, a second order transition is found, corresponding to the emergence of a mode in inelastic neutron scattering. Absence of an ordering transition in the suspected &lt;111&gt; antiferromagnet Pr2Hf2O7 is also shown, with specific heat measured down to 100 mK with no ordering transition.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Unipolar Charge-Sensing for Evaporated Large-Area Solid-State Photoconductors for Digital Radiography</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Goldan, Amirhossein</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>An alternative approach to energy integrating systems is photon counting which provides higher dose efficiency through efficient noise rejection and optimal energy weighting, and, moreover, is not susceptible to memory artifacts such as image lag and ghosting. The first large-area photon counting imager was Charpak's Nobel Prize winning invention of the gas-filled multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC), which revolutionized the field of radiation detection in 1968. In most applications, however, the use of a solid detection medium is preferable because solid densities are about three orders-of-magnitude greater than gas, and thus, they can yield much smaller detector dimensions with unsurpassed spatial and temporal resolution. Thus far, crystalline Cadmium Zinc Telluride is the only room-temperature solid-state detector that meets the requirements for photon counting imaging. However, the material is grown in small ingots and production costs are high for large-area imaging applications. The problem is that disordered (or non-crystalline) solids, which are easier and less expensive to develop over large-area than single crystalline solids, have been ruled out as viable photon counting detectors because of their poor temporal resolution, or more specifically, extremely low carrier mobilities and transit-time-limited photoresponse. To circumvent the problem of poor charge transport in disordered solids with a conventional planar detector structure, we propose unipolar charge sensing by establishing a strong near-field effect using an electrostatic shield within the material. We introduce the concept of time-differential photoresponse in unipolar solids and show that their temporal resolution can be improved substantially to reach the intrinsic physical limit set by spatial dispersion. Inspired by Charpak's MWPC and its variants, and for the first time, we have implemented an electrostatic shield inside evaporated amorphous selenium (a-Se) using the proposed lithography-based microstrip solid-state detector (MSSD). The fabricated devices are characterized with optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray impulse-like excitations. Using optical time-of-flight (TOF) measurements, we show for the first time a unipolar Gaussian TOF transient from the new MSSD structure, instead of a rectangular response with a Gaussian-integral at the tail which is a typical response of a conventional planar device. The measured optical and x-ray TOF results verify the time-differential property of the electrostatic shield and the practicality of the dispersion-limited photoresponse. Furthermore, we use single gamma-ray photon excitations to probe detector's temporal resolution in pulse mode for photon counting. For the MSSD, we show a depth-independent signal for photon absorption across the bulk and a reduction in signal risetime by a factor of 350, comparing performance limiting factors being hole-dispersion for the MSSD and electron-transit-time for the conventional planar device. The time-differential response obtained from the proposed unipolar detector structure enables disordered photoconductive films to become viable candidates for large-area photon counting applications.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Microwave detection techniques based on the theory of perturbation of cavity resonators are commonly used to measure the permittivity and permeability of objects of dielectric and ferrite materials at microwave frequencies. When a small object is introduced into a microwave cavity resonator, the resonant frequency is perturbed. Since it is possible to measure the change in frequency with high accuracy, this provides a valuable method for measuring the electric and magnetic properties of the object. Likewise, these microwave resonators can be used as sensors for sorting dielectric objects. Techniques based upon this principle are in common use for measuring the dielectric and magnetic properties of materials at microwave frequencies for variety of applications. This thesis presents an approach of using Artificial Neural Networks to detect material change in a rectangular cavity. The method is based on the theory of the perturbation of cavity resonators where a change in the resonant frequencies of the cavity is directly proportional to the dielectric constant of the inserted objects. A rectangular cavity test fixture was built and excited with a monopole antenna. The cavity was filled with different materials, and the reflection coefficient of each material was measured over a wide range of frequencies. An intelligent systems approach using an artificial neural network (ANN) methodology was implemented for the automatic material change detection. To develop an automatic detection model, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) was designed with one hidden layer and gradient descent back-propagation (BP) learning algorithm was used for the ANN training. The network training process was performed in an off-line mode, and after the training process was accomplished, the model was able to learn the rules without knowing any algorithm for automatic detection.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Exact Solutions and Black Hole Stability in Higher Dimensional Supergravity Theories</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Stotyn, Sean Michael Anton</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis examines exact solutions to gauged and ungauged supergravity theories in space-time dimensions D⩾5 as well as various instabilities of such solutions. I begin by using two solution generating techniques for five dimensional minimal ungauged supergravity, the first of which exploits the existence of a Killing spinor to generate supersymmetric solutions, which are time-like fibrations over four dimensional hyper-Kähler base spaces. I use this technique to construct a supersymmetric solution with the Atiyah-Hitchin metric as the base space. This solution has three independent parameters and possesses mass, angular momentum, electric charge and magnetic charge. Via an analysis of a congruence of null geodesics, I determine that the solution contains a region with naked closed time-like curves. The centre of the space-time is a conically singular pseudo-horizon that repels geodesics, otherwise known as a repulson. The region exterior to the closed time-like curves is outwardly geodesically complete and possesses an asymptotic region free of pathologies provided the angular momentum is chosen appropriately. The second solution generating technique exploits a hidden G2 symmetry in five dimensional minimal supergravity. I use this hidden symmetry approach to construct the most general black string solution in five dimensions, which is endowed with mass, angular momentum, linear momentum, electric charge and magnetic charge. This general black string satisfies the first law of thermodynamics, with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy being reproduced via a microstate counting in terms of free M-branes in the decoupling limit. Furthermore it reduces to all previously known black string solutions in its various limits. A phase diagram for extremal black strings is produced to draw conclusions about extremal black rings, in particular why supersymmetric black rings exhibit a lower bound on the electric charge. The same phase diagram further suggests the existence of a new class of supersymmetric black rings, which are completely disconnected from the previously known class. A particular limit of this general black string is the magnetically charged black string, whose thermodynamic phase behaviour and perturbative stability were previously studied but not very well understood. I construct magnetically charged topological solitons, which I then show play an important role in the phase structure of these black strings. Topological solitons in Einstein-Maxwell gravity, however, were previously believed to generically correspond to unstable "bubbles of nothing" which expand to destroy the space-time. I show that the addition of a topological magnetic charge changes the stability properties of these Kaluza-Klein bubbles and that there exist perturbatively stable, static, magnetically charged bubbles which are the local vacuum and the end-point of Hawking evaporation of magnetic black strings. In gauged supergravity theories, bubbles of nothing are stabilised by the positive energy theorem for asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-times. For orbifold anti-de Sitter space-times in odd dimensions, a local vacuum state of the theory is just such a bubble, known as the Eguchi-Hanson soliton. I study the phase behaviour of orbifold Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black holes, thermal orbifold anti-de Sitter space-times, and thermal Eguchi-Hanson solitons from a gravitational perspective; general agreement is found between this analysis and the previous analysis from the gauge theory perspective via the AdS/CFT correspondence. I show that the usual Hawking-Page phase structure is recovered and that the main effect of the soliton in the phase space is to widen the range of large black holes that are unstable to decay despite the positivity of their specific heat. Furthermore, using topological arguments I show that the soliton and orbifold AdS geometry correspond to a confinement phase in the boundary gauge theory while the black hole corresponds to a deconfinement phase. An important instability for rotating asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes is the superradiant instability. Motivated by arguments that the physical end point of this instability should describe a clump of scalar field co-rotating with the black hole, I construct asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole solutions with scalar hair. Perturbative results, i.e. low amplitude boson stars and small radius black holes with low amplitude scalar hair, are presented in odd dimensions relevant to gauged supergravity theories, namely D=5,7. These solutions are neither stationary nor axisymmetric, allowing them to evade the rigidity theorem; instead the space-time plus matter fields are invariant under only a single helical Killing vector. These hairy black holes are argued to be stable within their class of scalar field perturbations but are ultimately unstable to higher order perturbative modes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Manipulating Structure and Properties of Colloidal In2O3 Nanocrystals</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Farvid, Shokouh Sadat</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) have attracted extensive attention for decades due to their remarkable applications in optoelectronic devices. The development of functional nanostructured TCOs with unique properties, and an expansion of their functionalities are therefore research directions of significant current interest. Among TCOs, In2O3 is widely applied because of its high charge carrier concentration and mobility, as well as the ease with which it can be deposited as a thin film. The important role of surfaces in tuning properties in materials shows the importance of studying nanostructured materials with high surface areas. In this thesis I examined the synthesis of phase-controlled In2O3 nanocrystals (NCs) and showed the effect of doping and composition on the materials properties. Owing to the relevance of size, structure, and composition for manipulating properties of nanomaterials, synthesis of well-defined nanocrystals of pure and doped In2O3 has been of considerable interest for fundamental studies as well as for technological applications. Phase controlled synthesis of colloidal In2O3 NCs was achieved via a size-structure correlation. The study of the morphological and phase transformations of In2O3 NCs during their growth in solution implies that corundum (rh-In2O3) is a transient structure in the formation of cubic bixbyite (bcc-In2O3) phase. The formation of NCs smaller than 5 nm leads to the spontaneous stabilization of metastable phases owing to the surface energy and/or surface stress contributions, both of which are dependent on size. The growth beyond the critical size lowers the potential energy barrier height and causes the nanocrystal phase transformation. In addition, phase transformation of colloidal In2O3 NCs in the temperature range of 210-260 ˚C during their synthesis in solution was studied using a combination of structural and spectroscopic methods, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, and analyzed data using Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Erofeyev-Kholmogorov (JMAEK) and interface nucleation models. The phase transformation occurs via nucleation of bcc-In2O3 phase at the interface between contacting rh-In2O3 NCs, and propagates rapidly throughout the NC volume. In situ high temperature XRD patterns collected during nonisothermal treatment of In2O3 NCs reveal that phase transformation of smaller NCs occurs at a faster rate and lower temperature, which is associated with the higher packing density and contact formation probability of smaller nanoparticles. Owing to the fact that NC surfaces and interfaces play a key role in phase transformation, their control through the synthesis conditions and reaction kinetics is an effective route to manipulating NC structure and properties. Although, doping semiconductor NCs is crucial for enhancing and manipulating their functional properties, the doping mechanism and the effects of dopants on the nanocrystal growth and structure are not well understood. We show that dopant adsorption to the surfaces of colloidal In2O3 NCs during incorporation inhibit NC growth and leads to the formation of metastable rh-In2O3 for nanocrystals smaller than ca. 5 nm. Direct comparison between Cr3+ and Mn3+ dopants indicates that the nanocrystal structure directly determines the dopant incorporation limits and the dopant electronic structure, and can be predicted and controlled. These results enable a new approach to designing multifunctional nanostructures and understanding the early stages of crystal growth in the presence of impurities. Nanocrystalline films fabricated from colloidal Cr3+- and Mn3+- doped In2O3 nanocrystals exhibit strong ferromagnetic ordering up to room temperature. The absence of ferromagnetism in the free standing transition metal (TM)-doped In2O3 NCs and appearance of ferromagnetism only in TM:In2O3 films prepared from colloidal NCs, are attributed to the formation of extended structural defects, proposed to be oxygen vacancies at the NC interfaces. In fact, in TM:In2O3 NCs with high surface to volume ratios, more oxygen vacancies are present at the surface of NCs and networking of NCs in the prepared film causes an increase in grain-boundary defects at the interfaces. A comparative study of magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra of Cr3+-doped bcc-In2O3 and Cr3+-doped rh-In2O3 revealed that Cr3+ ions distinctly occupy different symmetry sites in corundum and bixbyite crystal structure of In2O3. In fact, a change in the crystal structure of In2O3 from bixbyite to corundum changes the electronic configuration of Cr3+. By manipulating the NC composition and structure in solution we applied a one-step synthesis of ternary gallium indium oxide (GIO) nanocrystals with variable crystal structures. The structures and sizes of GIO NCs can be simultaneously controlled, owing to the difference in the growth kinetics of In2O3 and Ga2O3 NCs, and the polymorphic nature of both materials. These dependences, induced by the interactions between specific defect sites acting as electron donors and acceptors, were used to achieve broad emission tunability in the visible spectral range at room temperature. The nature of the photoluminescence is identified as donor -acceptor pair (DAP) recombination and changes with increasing indium content owing to the changes in the energy states of, and interactions between, donors and acceptors. Structural analysis of GIO nanocrystals by extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy reveals that In3+ occupies only octahedral, rather than tetrahedral, sites in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3 nanocrystal host lattice, until reaching the substitutional incorporation limit of ca. 25%. The emission decay dynamics is also strongly influenced by the nanocrystal structure and composition.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Holographic Entanglement Entropy: RG Flows and Singular Surfaces</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Singh, Ajay</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Over the past decade, the AdS/CFT correspondence has proven to be a remarkable tool to study various properties of strongly coupled field theories. In the context of the holography, Ryu and Takayanagi have proposed an elegant method to calculate entanglement entropy for these field theories. In this thesis, we use this holographic entanglement entropy to study a candidate c-theorem and entanglement entropy for singular surfaces. We use holographic entanglement entropy for strip geometry and construct a candidate c-function in arbitrary dimensions. For holographic theories dual to Einstein gravity, this c-function is shown to decrease monotonically along RG flows. A sufficient condition required for this monotonic flow is that the stress tensor of the matter fields driving the holographic RG flow must satisfy the null energy condition over the holographic surface used to calculate the entanglement entropy. In the case where the bulk theory is described by Gauss-Bonnet gravity, the latter condition alone is not sufficient to establish the monotonic flow of the c-function. We also observe that for certain holographic RG flows, the entanglement entropy undergoes a ‘phase transition’ as the size of the system grows and as a result, evolution of the c-function may exhibit a discontinuous drop. Then, we turn towards studying the holographic entanglement entropy for regions with a singular boundary in higher dimensions. Here, we find that various singularities make new universal contributions. When the boundary CFT has an even spacetime dimension, we find that the entanglement entropy of a conical surface contains a term quadratic in the logarithm of the UV cut-off. In four dimensions, the coefficient of this contribution is proportional to the central charge c. A conical singularity in an odd number of spacetime dimensions contributes a term proportional to the logarithm of the UV cut-off. We also study the entanglement entropy for various boundary surfaces with extended singularities. In these cases, extended singularities contribute through new linear or quadratic terms in logarithm only when the locus of the singularity is even dimensional and curved.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Silicon Nanowires for Integrated Photonics: Bridging Nano and Micro Photonics</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Khorasaninejad, Mohammadreza</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Silicon Nanowires (SiNWs) with ability to confine carriers and photons in two directions while allowing propagation in third dimension offer interesting modified optical properties such as increased material absorption and optical non-linearities with regard to that of bulk silicon. Enhanced optical properties in SiNWs open a window not only to improve the performance of existing devices but also to realize novel structures. As such, I chose to investigate SiNWs for their applications in photonics, especially for sensing and non-linear devices. My goal was to conduct fundamental research on the optical properties of these SiNWs, and then develop an integration platform to realize practical devices. The platform should be compatible with IC manufacturing. Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) using a Poly Methyl Methacrylate (PMMA) resist followed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Reactive Ion Etching (ICP-RIE) is used for SiNWs fabrication. Now we are able to fabricate nanowires as small as 15 nm in diameter with the smallest separation of 50 nm. In addition, the interface between SiNWs and Si substrate is optically smooth enabling us to fundamentally understand optical properties of these structures. During the course of this project, I have contributed new fundamental knowledge about SiNWs. For example, Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) is demonstrated in SiNWs, which is absent in bulk silicon. This is achieved by self-straining the nanowires and is the first demonstration of this kind. Second-order non-linearities are more efficient for optical signal processing than third-order ones (which have been used for silicon photonics devices so far). Therefore, these results open a new area of research in silicon. In addition to second order nonlinearity, high enhancement of Raman scattering is achieved in SiNWs fabricated on Silicon on Insulator (SOI) substrate. This can find promising applications in sensing and nonlinear based devices such as optical switches and logic gates. Further, polarization resolved reflections from these nanowire arrays were measured and significant differences were observed for the reflection characteristics for the sand p-polarized beams. In order to understand these reflections, an effective index model is proposed based on calculations using Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. Results of this analysis provide useful information for designing of many optical devices using SiNWs such as solar cells and photodetectors. As another part of this thesis, vivid colors in mutually coupled SiNWs is demonstrated where nanowire diameters range from 105 nm to 345 nm. A simple sensor is demonstrated by observing the change in the reflected color with changing refractive index of the surrounding medium. A refractive index resolution of 5×10−5 is achieved using a simple charge coupled device (CCD) camera. Although, there were some paradigm shifting results during my fundamental studies, it became very apparent that SiNWs suffer from a major issue inhibiting their use in photonics devices. Below the diameter of 100 nm where these enhanced material properties were observed, SiNW is a poor optical waveguide with less than 1 % of light confined. The low confinement factor means that though the intrinsic properties of SiNWs increase, the overall device performance is not significantly enhanced. To overcome this issue, a new platform technology is invented, called Silicon Nanowire Optical Waveguide (SNOW). It combines the material advantages of nanostructures with the optical properties of conventional waveguides, and consists of arrays of nanowires in close proximity. It is shown that such a structure can guide an optical mode using the FDTD method. This waveguide structure can be used as a versatile platform to manufacture various devices such as sensors, switches, modulators, grating, and delay lines. For instance, a novel bio-sensor is proposed and designed whose sensitivity is enhanced by a factor of 20, compared to conventional silicon-wire waveguides.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In this thesis, I will present the experimental results of the dynamics of superconducting single electron transistors (sSETs), under the influence of tunable dissipation. The sSET, consisting of two dc SQUIDs in series and the third gate electrode, is deposited onto a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure which contains a two dimensional electron gas plane 100nm beneath the substrate surface. The Josephson coupling energy, charging energy and dissipation related Hamiltonian can all be tuned in situ, while keeping others unchanged. We measured the switching current statistics and the transport properties, as a function of the dissipation and gate charge at different temperatures. If the sSET is in the classical regime where phase is a good quantum variable, we found that the switching current and corresponding Josephson energy decrease as dissipation increases. Our observation agrees qualitatively with the theoretical calculation of a single Josephson junction with dominant Josephson energy, in a frequency dependent dissipative environment where energy barrier decreases as dissipation increases in thermally activated escape regime. This dissipation dependence result can be understood as the consequence of a reduced quantum fluctuations in the charge numbers. Whereas in the charging regime, the switching current shows a 1e periodicity with respect to gate charge, indicating a pronounced charging effect. At a specific gate charge number, quantum fluctuations of the phase variable are compressed as dissipation increases, resulting in an enhanced switching current and Josephson energy. This result matches the theory of a sSET capacitively coupled to a dissipative environment qualitatively. The temperature dependence of the switching current histogram indicates the existence of both quantum and classical thermal phase diffusion. Moreover, quantum charge fluctuations are minimized at the degeneracy point, causing a sharp dip on the width of the switching current histogram. For a sSET with comparable Josephson energy and charging energy, quantum fluctuations of both phase and charge variables are significant. The influence of dissipation on the dynamics of the device is distinct in the classical and charging regimes. Dissipation compresses quantum phase fluctuations in the charging regime, whereas reduces the quantum charge fluctuations in the classical regime. The transition between these two regimes is found to be determined by the tunnel resistance of the SQUID. The competition between Josephson and charging energies, however, is not the intrinsic parameter of this transition. Our results imply that a detailed theoretical calculation of a sSET with comparable Josephson coupling energy and charging energy under the influence of dissipation is needed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Computational Study of Pressure Driven Flow in Waste Rock Piles</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Penney, Jared</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis is motivated by problems studied as part of the Diavik Waste Rock Pile Project. Located at the Diavik Diamond Mine in the Northwest Territories, with academic support from the University of Waterloo, the University of Alberta, and the University of British Columbia, this project focuses on constructing mine waste rock piles and studying their physical and chemical properties and the transport processes within them. One of the main reasons for this investigation is to determine the effect of environmental factors on acid mine drainage (AMD) due to sulfide oxidation and the potential environmental impact of AMD. This research is concerned with modeling pressure driven flow through waste rock piles. Unfortunately, because of the irregular shape of the piles, very little data for fluid flow about such an obstacle exists, and the numerical techniques available to work with this domain are limited. Since this restricts the study of the mathematics behind the flow, this thesis focuses on a cylindrical domain, since flow past a solid cylinder has been subjected to many years of study. The cylindrical domain also facilitates the implementation of a pseudo-spectral method. This thesis examines a pressure driven flow through a cylinder of variable permeability subject to turbulent forcing. An equation for the steady flow of an incompressible fluid through a variable permeability porous medium is derived based on Darcy's law, and a pseudo-spectral model is designed to solve the problem. An unsteady time-dependent model for a slightly compressible fluid is then presented, and the unsteady flow through a constant permeability cylinder is examined. The steady results are compared with a finite element model on a trapezoidal domain, which provides a better depiction of a waste rock pile cross section.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Topological Semimetals</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hook, Michael</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis describes two topological phases of matter, the Weyl semimetal and the line node semimetal, that are related to but distinct from topological insulator phases. These new topological phases are semimetallic, having electronic energy bands that touch at discrete points or along a continuous curve in momentum space. These states are achieved by breaking time-reversal symmetry near a transition between an ordinary insulator and a topological insulator, using a model based on alternating layers of topological and ordinary insulators, which can be tuned close to the transition by choosing the thicknesses of the layers. The semimetallic phases are topologically protected, with corresponding topological surface states, but the protection is due to separation of the band-touching points in momentum space and discrete symmetries, rather than being protected by an energy gap as in topological insulators. The chiral surface states of the Weyl semimetal give it a non-zero Hall conductivity, while the surface states of the line node semimetal have a flat energy dispersion in the region bounded by the line node. Some transport properties are derived, with a particular emphasis on the behaviour of the conductivity as a function of the impurity concentrations and the temperature.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Theory and Applications of Josephson Photomultipliers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Govia, Luke Colin Gene</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis describes the back action of microwave-photon detection via a Josephson photomultiplier (JPM), a superconducting qubit coupled strongly to a high-quality mi- crowave cavity, and the applications of these devices. The back action operator depends qualitatively on the duration of the measurement interval, resembling the regular photon annihilation operator at short interaction times and approaching a variant of the photon subtraction operator at long times. The optimal operating conditions of the JPM differ from those considered optimal for processing and storing of quantum information, in that a short T2 of the JPM suppresses the cavity dephasing incurred during measurement. Un- derstanding this back action opens the possibility to perform multiple JPM measurements on the same state, hence performing efficient state tomography. In addition, this the- sis describes the creation of non-classical states of microwave radiation via single photon detection using JPMs. When operated in the low T2 regime, the back action of a JPM resembles the photon subtraction operator. Using the non-linearity of this back action, it is possible to create non-classical states of microwave radiation, including squeezed vacuum and odd Schro ̈dinger cat states, starting from a coherent state.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Low Temperature Magnetic Relaxation of Dy₂Ti₂O₇</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Revell, Halle</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The recent formulation of the monopole picture of spin ice[1, 2, 3], has lead to several studies of the signatures of monopole excitations[2, 4], as well as studies of the motion of magnetic monopoles[5, 6, 7]. In this thesis low temperature dynamics of the dipolar spin ice material Dy₂Ti₂O₇ are examined through SQUID measurements of the dc magnetic relaxation. The results are compared to recent ac susceptibility measurements[8] and new Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that instead of the relaxation being a single exponential decay with a temperature-activated relaxation time, which is what is expected from the dipolar spin ice model[9, 10, 11], the relaxation is a stretched exponential that develops into a long-time tail. The relaxation has a temperature-activated relaxation time, τ(T) = τo exp(∆E/kT), that has an energy barrier, ∆E/k, of ∼ 9K, as opposed to the ∼ 5 K energy barrier predicted by the dipolar spin ice model. By comparison to dynamic Monte Carlo simulations the stretched exponential behaviour is attributed to surface effects of the sample and the long-time tail is explained by a small amount (0.3 %) of stuffed Dy spins in the material. The 9 K energy barrier is explained by assuming that the basic spin flip process is not fully temperature independent and instead has an energy barrier of 4 K. This study should bring to light the importance of taking material defects and surface effects into account as one would in an electric conductor, whose material defects lead to resistance. Even in the case of the spin ice materials, which are usually assumed to be extremely “clean”, defects can play an important role in the dynamics and this study is the first instance where resistance meets “magneticity”.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electronic and Optical Properties of Silicon Nanowires: Theory and Modeling</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Shiri, Daryoush</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Narrow silicon nanowires host a rich set of physical phenomena. Understanding these phenomena will open new opportunities for applications of silicon nanowires in optoelectronic devices and adds more functionality to silicon especially in those realms that bulk silicon may not operate remarkably. Compatibility of silicon nanowires with the mainstream fabrication technology is also advantageous. The main theme of this thesis is finding the possibility of using silicon nanowires in light sources; laser and light emitting diodes. Using Tight Binding (TB) and ab-initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods it was shown that axial strain can induce significant changes in the effective mass, density of states and bandgap of silicon nanowires. Generality of the observed effects was proven by investigating nanowires of different crystallography, diameter and material (e.g. germanium nanowires). The observed direct to indirect bandgap conversion suggests that strain is able to modulate the light emission properties of silicon nanowires. To investigate this possibility, spontaneous emission time was formulated using perturbation theory including Longitudinal Optical (LO) and Acoustic (LA) phonons. It was observed that corresponding to bandgap conversion, the spontaneous emission time can be modulated by more than one order of magnitude. This emanates from bandgap conversion and symmetry change of wave function in response to strain. A mechanism for population inversion was proposed in the thesis which is based on the Ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) study of carrier statistics in direct and indirect conduction sub bands. By calculating all possible electron-phonon scattering mechanisms which may deplete the already populated indirect subband, it was shown that at different temperatures and under different electric fields there is a factor of 10 difference between the population of indirect and direct sub bands. This suggests that population inversion can be achieved by biasing an already strained nanowire in its indirect bandgap state. The light emission is possible then by releasing or inverting the strain direction. A few ideas of implementing this experiment were proposed as a patent application. Furthermore the photo absorption of silicon nanowires was calculated using TB method and the role of diameter, optical anisotropy and strain were investigated on band-edge absorption.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The two-space homogenization method</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Murley, Jonathan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, we consider the two-space homogenization method, which produces macroscopic expressions out of descriptions of the behaviour of the microstructure. Specifically, we focus on its application to poroelastic media. After describing the method, we provide examples to demonstrate that the resultant expressions are equivalent to an explicit derivation, which might not always be possible, and to outline the method for proving that the expressions converge to their macroscopic equivalents. Upon providing the basis for this method, we follow Burridge and Keller’s work for using this to prove the existence of Biot’s consolidation equations for poroelastic media and to provide expressions for the derivation of the parameters of these equations from the microstructure [5]. We then discuss the benefits and challenges that arise from this formulation of Biot’s consolidation equations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An investigation of low energy quasiparticle excitations via thermal conductivity measurements</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Toews, William Henry</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Thermal conductivity measurements are made on a variety of systems in order to probe low energy quasiparticle excitations. In particular, thermal conductivity measurements were made on the iron based superconducting material LaFePO at temperatures from 60 mK to 1 K and in fields from 0 T to 5 T in order to shed light on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. A substantial non-zero electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity is observed and interpreted as sub-gap electronic quasiparticles which is clear evidence for a nodal gap symmetry. A high scattering rate and non-T3 temperature dependence of the conductivity is evidence against the d-wave scenario. However, the field dependence does seem to suggest that the anisotropic s+- picture is a likely candidate for the order parameter, although more theoretical work is required to confirm this. Thermal conductivity measurements were also made on the spin-ice system Ho2Ti2O7 between 50 mK and 1.4 K in applied magnetic fields from 0 T to 8 T in an attempt to observe the much debated magnetic monopole-like quasiparticles. An applied magnetic field of 8 T was applied along to [111] direction as to fully polarize the magnetic moments in order to extract the phonon contribution of the thermal conductivity. The low field thermal conductivity reveals evidence for an additional heat transfer mechanism that also scatters phonons which is magnetic in nature. This is taken to be evidence for the existence of monopole-like excitations out of the spin-ice ground state and is described by existing Debye-Huckel theory. Thermal transport was used in conjunction with charge conductivity to study the unconventional quantum critical point (QCP) in the heavy-Fermion superconductor beta-YbAlB4 at temperatures down to 60 mK and in fields up to 2 T. The results show that the Wiedemann-Franz law (WFL) is obeyed down to the lowest measured temperatures indicating that the Landau quasiparticles remain intact near the QCP. A small suppression of the Wiedemann-Franz ratio (L/L0 = kappa / sigma T L0) is seen at finite temperatures (T &lt; 1 K) with minimal dependence on magnetic field. Comparing with other similar quantum critical systems, it becomes apparent that inelastic scattering events have little effect on the transport and are mainly field independent in beta-YbAlB4. An overview of the design for a new thermal conductivity mount is also presented. The design hinges around the idea of building the experiment mount into a small copper box rather than on an open frame. Not only does this provide mechanical stability for safe transportation, it also reduces the noise caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI) in the sample thermometers by more than a factor of ten over the old wire frame design.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Single-Phase and Boiling Flow in Microchannels with High Heat Flux</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Galvis, Elmer</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A cooling system for high heat flux applications is examined using microchannel evaporators with water as the working fluid and boiling as the heat transfer mechanism. Experimental studies are performed using single channel microevaporators allowing for better control of the flow mechanics unlike other investigations where multiple, parallel, flow channels can result in a non-uniform distribution of the working fluid. High-speed flow visualizations are performed in conjunction with heat transfer and pressure drop measurements to support the quantitative experimental data. Flow patterns associated with a range of boundary conditions are characterized and then presented in the form of novel flow regime maps that intrinsically reflect the physical mechanisms controlling two-phase pressure distributions and heat transfer behavior. Given the complexity associated with modeling of boiling heat transfer and the lack of a universal model that provides accurate predictions across a broad spectrum of flow conditions, flow regime maps serve as a valuable modeling aid to assist in targeted modeling over specific flow regimes. This work represents a novel and original contribution to the understanding of boiling mechanisms for water in microchannels. The flow patterns in this work are found to be closely coupled with mass flux, heat flux, and channel size; where re-wetting and pressure oscillations play a crucial role, and are likely responsible for its development and evolution. Reversed flow, typically attributed to a non-uniform fluid distribution in multiple channel microevaporators by other researchers, is shown to be a result of the upstream expansion of confined bubbles. During flow boiling, the pressure drop in the microchannel increases with the heat flux for a constant flow rate due to the significant acceleration effects associated with smaller channels, unlike in single-phase flow where the pressure drop is constant. Water flow boiling in rectangular microchannels, although not extensively explored in the published literature, provides an extremely high cooling capacity, with dissipation rates approaching 440 W/cm², making this an ideal candidate for cooling of next generation electronic systems. Single-phase flow studies revealed that pressure and heat transfer coefficient macroscale models are transferable to microchannels with hydraulic diameters down to 200 µm, when the entrance effects and minor losses are properly considered. These studies include laminar developing flow conditions not commonly considered in the literature and fully developed flow. Since the applicability of macroscale theories to microchannels is often questioned, this investigation helps clarify this issue for microchannels within the range of experimental conditions explored in this work. Finally, new correlations for the hydrodynamic entrance length are proposed for rectangular microchannels and good agreement is found when compared with published experimental data over a wide range of Reynolds number. These correlations are more accurate, and original in the sense that they incorporate the effects of channel aspect ratio, and include creeping flow conditions which are currently unavailable for rectangular microchannels. This work represents a major advance in the development of new cooling systems for high heat flux applications requiring dissipation rates in excess of 100 W/cm².</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Integrated System and Component Technologies for Fiber-Coupled MM-Wave/THz Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zandieh, Alireza</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>THz and mm-wave technology has become increasingly significant in a very diverse range of applications such as spectroscopy, imaging, and communication as a consequence of a plethora of signiﬁcant advances in this field. However to achieve a mass production of THz systems, all the commercial aspects should be considered. The main concerns are attributed to the robustness, compactness, and a low cost device. In this regard, research efforts should be focused on the elimination of obstacles standing in the way of commercializing the THz technology. To this end, in this study, low cost fabrication technologies for various parts of mm-wave/THz systems are investigated and explored to realize compact, integrated, and rugged components. This task is divided into four phases. In the first phase, a robust fiber-based beam delivery configuration is deployed instead of the free beam optics which is essential to operate the low cost THz photomixers and photoconductive antennas. The compensation of different effects on propagation of the optical pulse along the optical fiber is achieved through all-fiber system to eliminate any bulky and unstable optical components from the system. THz measurements on fiber-coupled systems exhibit the same performance and even better compared to the free beam system. In the next phase, the generated THz wave is coupled to a rectangular dielectric waveguide through design of a novel transition with low insertion loss. The structure dimensions are reported for various range of frequencies up to 650GHz with insertion loss less than 1dB. The structure is fabricated through a standard recipe. In third phase, as consequence of the advent of high performance active device at mm-wave and THz frequency, a transition is proposed for coupling the electromagnetic wave to the active devices with CPW ports. Different approaches are devised for different frequencies as at higher frequencies any kind of metallic structure can introduce a considerable amount of loss to the system. The optimized structures show minimum insertion loss as low as 1dB and operate over 10% bandwidth. The various configurations are fabricated for lower frequencies to verify the transition performance. The last phase focuses on the design, optimization, fabrication and measurements of a new dielectric side-grating antenna for frequency scanning applications. The radiation mechanism is extensively studied using two different commercial full-wave solvers as well as the measured data from the fabricated samples. The optimized antenna achieves a radiation efficiency of 90% and a gain of 18dB. The measured return loss and radiation pattern show a good agreement with the simulation results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical studies of transport and spin-orbit exchange in InAs nanowires</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gupta, Nupur</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>High spin-orbit coupling and low effective mass of electrons in InAs nanowires makes it an attractive material for studying quantum physics in mesoscopic and nanoscale quantum devices. We first study the transport properties of FET devices made of InAs nanowires of diameter in the range of 35-70 nm. The temperature dependence of electron mobility in InAs nanowires from 10-200 K exhibits a positive slope below approximately 0 K, then turns over to a negative slope at higher temperatures. This is explained by Coulomb scattering from the surface donor like states that give rise to a subsurface accumulation layer and the thermal activation of these surface donors. The scattering rates are calculated using a momentum relaxation time approximation. The transition probabilities between the self-consistent Poisson-Schrodinger states of a 50 nm diameter nanowire are calculated using Fermi's golden rule. The results clarify the dominant scattering mechanism in InAs nanowires and signify the need for surface passivation to obtain high mobility devices. In a second study, we model a gate defined double quantum dot in the nanowire with high spin-orbit coupling in order to determine the precise gate voltage dependence of the exchange Hamiltonian. This modelling is critical for designing two-qubit quantum logic operations in the nanowire double dot architecture. A quantum double well structure is simulated based on the realistic potential created by a set of fine local electrostatic gates in the presence of nanowire surface accumulation layer. An effective spin Hamiltonian is derived for a pair of interacting electrons localized in the double dot system in the presence of a strong spin-orbit coupling. The accuracy of the effective Hamiltonian is established by a strong agreement obtained between the dynamics generated by the effective Hamiltonian with those obtained by a numerically exact solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The parametric dependences of the effective exchange Hamiltonian on external magnetic field, barrier gate voltage, and spin-orbit field is determined. This opens the door to designing optimal pulses for high fidelity quantum gates in real InAs nanowire devices.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>In vivo Imaging of Light Induced Intrinsic Optical Signals in the Chicken Retina with a Combined Ultra-High Resolution Optical Coherence Tomography and Electroretinography System</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Akhlagh Moayed, Alireza</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the intrinsic optical signals (IOSs) with an ultra-high resolution optical coherence tomography system (UHROCT). In order to study the retinal IOSs evoked by visible light, an UHROCT and an Electroretinogram (ERG) system was combined. An animal model (chicken retina) based on its retinal avascularity and cone dominance, was selected. Imaging the chicken retina with OCT resulted in high contrast, high resolution (~3μm axial and ~5 μm lateral resolution) 2D and 3D volumetric tomograms, in which all retina layers were clearly distinguishable. Using the combined UHROCT and ERG system to image IOSs from the chicken retina exposed to visible light (7ms green flash) resulted in highly reproducible IOS recordings from all retinal layers for the first time. All inner retinal layers showed an initial increase and subsequently a decrease in the intensity of the backreflected imaging light within the first 100 ms after the onset of the stimulus. Outer segments of the photoreceptors also showed a decrease in the backreflected imaging light within 100 ms after the onset of the flash. All retinal layers showed a strong decrease in the backreflected light within 150 to 175 ms after the onset of the flash. Imaging the pupil dynamics of the chicken with a modified combined UHROCT and ERG system showed that part of the strong negative IOSs observed in all retinal layers resulted from the vignetting of the imaging beam due to the light induced pupil constriction. Thorough analysis of the pupil dynamics acquired with UHROCT showed a time dependent effect of the anesthesia agent on pupil constriction. Further experiments to investigate an anesthesia effects on retinal function showed significant changes in ERG components. Statistical analysis showed that Isoflurane anesthesia severely affects the inner retinal response. In conclusion, it was hypothesized that the fast IOSs within ~50-100 ms after the onset of the visual stimulus originated from the neuronal tissue in the retina and are related to tissue optical property changes as a result of the electrical signal propagation in the light activated retina. Longer term decreases in backreflected light are likely due to pupil changes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Pixel-less and Pixel-lated Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Infrared Imaging Upconversion Devices</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tao, Jianchen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Nowadays, the industrial standard for infrared imaging systems is to interconnect an infrared photodetector array with a silicon-based read-out-integrated circuit pixel by pixel through existing indium bumping technology for infrared scene detection and then the signal is output optically through a LCD or other imaging devices. Motivated by the high-cost and low-resolution of such configurations, technology that up-converts infrared light to visible light and in particular, an inorganic/organic hybrid imaging upconverter has been developed. The end goal was to provide a high-efficiency and high-resolution alternative for infrared imaging. The inorganic/organic hybrid architecture takes advantage of both the high quantum efficiency of photo-detection for inorganic semiconductors, and the low-cost processing and the topologically perfect structure of organic semiconductors that does not require lattice matching for materials. Based on previous single-element hybrid infrared upconverter designs, both pixel-less and pixel-lated hybrid infrared imaging devices are presented, with experimental results, in this thesis. The pixel-less hybrid infrared imaging upconverter suppresses the lateral carrier diffusion by using a hybrid Schottky junction with an intrinsic interconnection layer between the inorganic and organic parts. The device was fabricated in one large-area mesa and proved that the emitting light spatially correlated with the infrared imaging shone at its back. This device is the first-ever hybrid pixel-less infrared upconverter to successfully demonstrate the imaging of infrared patterns. In contrast, the pixel-lated device consisted of 128 by 128 pixels, and each pixel was an individually working infrared upconverter that integrated a heterojunction phototransistor (HPT) and an organic light emitting diode (OLED). The HPT provides not only the photoresponse upon incoming infrared light but also an amplification of the photocurrent. The pixel-lated device also successfully demonstrated the first-ever upconversion of infrared light, up-converting a light with a wavelength of 1.5 μm to 520 nm.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Novel THz Photoconductive Source and Waveguide Based on One-dimensional Nano-grating</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jafarlou, Saman</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A terahertz photoconductive source structure with nano-grating electrodes is proposed. The resonance modes of the one-dimensional nano-grating and their affect the optical power absorption are studied. In addition, an approach for optimal design of the grating to maximize the photocurrent for different proposed DC biases, is presented. The dependence of the photocurrent on physical parameters of photomixer are analyzed. A fast analysis method for a new terahertz waveguide for photo-mixing is proposed. The wave-guiding mixer structure is a modified parallel plate waveguide (PPWG) in which the top plate is replaced by a periodic array of sub-wavelength nano-slits. The substrate of the PPWG is made of a fast photoconductive material in which laser photomixing/absorption occurs. The characteristic equation of the modified PPWG when used as a THz waveguide is derived analytically, and its guided modes are studied in details over THz range of frequencies. The accuracy of the analytical results are verified by comparison with full-wave numerical simulations. The criteria for choosing the suitable mode for photomixing application are also discussed. Finally, based on dyadic Green’s function representation, a systematic approach is provided for calculating the amplitude of the guided modes that are excited by an arbitrary photocurrent.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical Modeling of Drug Delivery to Solid Tumor Microvasculature</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Soltani, Madjid</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Modeling interstitial fluid flow involves processes such as fluid diffusion, convective transport in the extracellular matrix, and extravasation from blood vessels. In all of these processes, computational fluid dynamics can play a crucial role in elucidating the mechanisms of fluid flow in solid tumors and surrounding tissues. To date, microvasculature flow modeling has been most extensively studied with simple tumor shapes and their capillaries at different levels and scales. With our proposed numerical model, however, more complex and realistic tumor shapes and capillary networks can be studied. First, a mathematical model of interstitial fluid flow is developed, based on the application of the governing equations for fluid flow, i.e., the conservation laws for mass and momentum, to physiological systems containing solid tumors. Simulations of interstitial fluid transport in a homogeneous solid tumor demonstrate that, in a uniformly perfused tumor, i.e., one with no necrotic region, the interstitial pressure distribution results in a non-uniform distribution of drug particles. Pressure distribution for different values of necrotic radii is examined, and two new parameters, the critical tumor radius and critical necrotic radius, are defined. In specific ranges of these critical dimensions the interstitial fluid pressure is relatively lower, which in turn leads to a diminished opposing force against drug movement and a subsequently higher drug concentration and potentially enhanced therapeutic effects. In this work, the numerical model of fluid flow in solid tumors is further developed to incorporate and investigate non-spherical tumor shapes such as prolate and oblate ones. Using this enhanced model, tumor shape and size effects on drug delivery to solid tumors are then studied. Based on the assumption that drug particles flow with the interstitial fluid, the pressure and velocity maps of the latter are used to illustrate the drug delivery pattern in a solid tumor. Additionally, the effects of the surface area per unit volume of the tissue, as well as vascular and interstitial hydraulic conductivity on drug delivery efficiency, are investigated. Using a tumor-induced microvasculature architecture instead of a uniform distribution of vessels provides a more realistic model of solid tumors. To this end, continuous and discrete mathematical models of angiogenesis were utilized to observe the effect of matrix density and matrix degrading enzymes on capillary network formation in solid tumors. Additionally, the interactions between matrix-degrading enzymes, the extracellular matrix and endothelial cells are mathematically modeled. Existing continuous and discrete models of angiogenesis were modified to impose the effect of matrix density on the solution. The imposition has been performed by a specific function in movement potential. Implementing realistic boundary and initial conditions showed that, unlike in previous models, the endothelial cells accelerate as they migrate toward the tumor. Now, the tumor-induced microvasculature network can be applied to the model developed in Chapters 2 and 3. Once the capillary network was set up, fluid flow in normal and cancerous tissues was numerically simulated under three conditions: constant and uniform distribution of intravascular pressure in the whole domain, a rigid vascular network, and an adaptable vascular network. First, governing equations of sprouting angiogenesis were implemented to specify the different domains for the network and interstitium. Governing equations for flow modeling were introduced for different domains. The conservation laws for mass and momentum, Darcy’s equation for tissue, and a simplified Navier Stokes equation for blood flow through capillaries were then used for simulating interstitial and intravascular flows. Finally, Starling’s law was used to close this system of equations and to couple the intravascular and extravascular flows. The non-continuous behavior of blood and the adaptability of capillary diameter to hemodynamics and metabolic stimuli were considered in blood flow simulations through a capillary network. This approach provided a more realistic capillary distribution network, very similar to that of the human body. This work describes the first study of flow modeling in solid tumors to realistically couple intravascular and extravascular flow through a network generated by sprouting angiogenesis, consisting of one parent vessel connected to the network. Other key factors incorporated in the model for the first time include capillary adaptation, non-continuous viscosity blood, and phase separation of blood flow in capillary bifurcation. Contrary to earlier studies which arbitrarily assumed veins and arteries to operate on opposite sides of a tumor network, the present approach requires the same vessel to run and from the network. Expanding the earlier models by introducing the outlined components was performed in order to achieve a more-realistic picture of blood flow through solid tumors. Results predict an almost doubled interstitial pressure and are in better agreement with human biology compared to the more simplified models generally in use today.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nonlinear Wave Propagation in Brass Instruments</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Resch, Janelle</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The study of wave production and propagation is a common phenomenon seen within a variety of math and physics problems. This thesis in particular will investigate the production and propagation of sound waves through musical instruments. Although this field of work has been examined since the late 1800s, approaching these types of problems can be very difficult. With the exception of the last fifty years, we have only been able to approach such problems by linearizing the necessary equations of gas dynamics. Without the use of a computer, one can only get so far in studying nonlinear acoustic problems. In addition, the numerical theory for nonlinear problems is incomplete. Proving stability is challenging and there are a variety of open problems within this field. This thesis will be examining the propagation of sound waves specifically through brass instruments. However, we will not be able to fully examine this problem in a master’s thesis because of the complexity. Instead, the objective is to provide a foundation and global picture of this problem by merge the fields of nonlinear acoustics as well as computational and analytical gas dynamics. To study the general behaviour of nonlinear wave propagation (and to verify previous findings), experiments have been carried on a trumpet. The purpose of these experiments is take measurements of the sound pressure waves at various locations along the instrument in order to understand the evolution of the wave propagation. In particular, we want to establish if the nonlinear distortion is strong enough to have musical consequences; and if there are such outcomes, what prerequisites are required for the observable behaviour. Additionally, by using the discontinuous Galerkin numerical method, a model of the system will be presented in this thesis. It will then be compared with the experimental data to verify how well we were able to describe the nonlinear wave motion within a trumpet.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quantum Dots for Intermediate Band in Solar Cells</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Dashmiz, Shadi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The commercially available solar cells suffer from low efficiency and high cost. This would avoid presence of solar cells as a secure energy resource in the market. Problems stem from two facts. Firstly, band gap of materials deployed for cell fabrication do not match the solar spectrum. Secondly, harvesting all the generated electrons is imperfect due to presence of many non-radiative recombination processes and, thermalization of electrons. To transcend these deficiencies, third generation of solar has been introduced. This new generation renders a whole new concept both in design and materials of solar cells scope. One of new introduction to solar cell field is Quantum Dot (QD). QD offers a broad range of tunability. The optical and electrical properties of QDs can be altered by choice of material, size and shape; therefore; they have great potential for high efficiency cell fabrication. QDs are mainly grown via MBE or synthesized via Colloidal solutions. QDs could be integrated as a part of one of new and promising third generation cells, named Intermediate Band Solar Cells. QDs could be employed as the intermediate level. If MBE is the selected method for cell fabrication, QDs would grow in a matrix of barrier material accompanied with a wetting layer. Wetting layer would disturb the ideal condition predicted in theory for gaining the high efficiency. To study how wetting layer would affect IB performance two sets of simulations have been carried out. One part is done with COSMOL. In this part different number of QDs layers have been simulated with and without wetting layer. The result showed that parasitic effect of wetting layer could not be eliminated large stacks of QD are stacked together, to achieve the promised efficient wetting layer should be eliminated from the system. In MATLAB part QDs have been approximated with simple cuboid. The main aim in this part was to compare how the result of taking into the account the real shape differs from a simple approach which has been the most reported the most in literature. If all the restrains on achieving high efficiency of IBSC are met, still one major draw- back remains and, that is high cost of MBE process. This would hinder mass production of IB cell. One possible potential method to gradually replace MBE can be Colloidal QDs. Colloidal QDs are fairly low cost and easy to fabricate. In this work, colloidal crystal growth was examined. The best condition for monolayer deposition was obtained and, the feasibility of crystal growth was demonstrated. additionally, There was an attempt to grow more than one layer and investigate result of embedding QDs in a barrier of another material.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Simulation of Cracks in a Cosserat Medium using the eXtended Finite Element Method</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kapiturova, Maria</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This research investigates fracture behaviour in the Cosserat materials. The Cosserat elasticity description of the materials incorporates a characteristic length scale (e.g. grains, particles, fibres, etc.) into the model. The characteristic length scale in such materials is known to significantly influence the macroscopic behaviour of the whole body. Simulation of the fracture processes, such as crack opening and propagation, in Cosserat materials still remains a challenge for the scientific community. The goal of this thesis is to propose and validate a two dimensional extended finite element method model of edge cracks within the Cosserat elasticity theory framework. The crack modelling was conducted using the Finite Element Method (FEM) and eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) implemented in the Matlab code. The strong and weak formulations of the problem and the discrete XFEM equations are presented in the thesis. Mode I and II edge crack models in a Cosserat medium are discussed and verified through a series of patch and convergence tests. In addition, the numerical evaluation of the J-integral for the Cosserat medium is presented, and the J-integral for the Cosserat medium is compared to the J-integral for the classical elasticity. The XFEM/Cosserat method is shown to be robust and able to effectively model the edge crack problems in a Cosserat medium. Moreover, the Cosserat elastic parameter is found to be a powerful coupling tool between the microrotations and the translations. The Cosserat J-integral differs from the classical J-integral by 2% to 40%, for a given crack depending on the micropolar elastic coupling constant.</dc:description>

To this end, a computational model was developed to simulate the effect of wavelength-dependant water absorption on the detected spectral shape of the broad-bandwidth light source used in UHR-OCT at 1060nm wavelength region, which effectively determines the axial OCT resolution in the retina. For experimental verification of the computational model, a custom built light source with a re-shaped spectrum (Superlum Inc.) was interfaced to the state-of-the-art UHR-OCT system. About 30% improvement of the axial OCT resolution in the rat retina and ~12% improvement of the axial OCT resolution in the human retina was achieved compared to the case of the almost Gaussian shaped spectrum of the standard, commercially available SLD. Although water absorption in the 1060nm spectral region strongly affects the sample beam, selecting a suitable light source with specific spectral shape can compensate for the undesired water absorption effect and thus result in significantly improved axial resolution in in vivo OCT retinal images. To demonstrate the advantages of the state-of-the-art OCT technology for non invasive retinal imaging, an established animal model of outer retina degeneration (sodium iodate (NaIO3)-induced retina degeneration) was employed for longitudinal monitoring of the degeneration and investigation of possible early and dynamic signs of damage undetected by other imaging modalities. The long-term (up to 3 months) and short-term (up to 12 hours) effect of sodium iodate toxicity on the layered structure of retina was monitored longitudinally and in vivo for the first time using OCT. An initial acute swelling of the retina, followed by progressive disruption and degeneration of outer retina was observed as a result of sodium iodate-induced damage. Changes in the thickness and optical reflectivity of individual retinal layers were extracted from the OCT images to quantify the changes occurring at different stages of the disease model. Results from this project present the theoretical and practical limits to the highest axial OCT resolution achievable for retina imaging in the 1060nm spectral range both in small animals and humans, and provided a framework for future development of novel light sources. Furthermore, UHR-OCT imaging was shown to be an effective and valuable modality for in vivo, non invasive investigation of retina degenerative disease.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Conditional Moment Closure Methods for Turbulent Combustion Modelling</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>El Sayed, Ahmad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis describes the application of the first-order Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) to the autoignition of high-pressure fuel jets, and to piloted and lifted turbulent jet flames using classical and advanced CMC submodels. A Doubly-Conditional Moment Closure (DCMC) formulation is further proposed. In the first study, CMC is applied to investigate the impact of C₂H₆, H₂ and N₂ additives on the autoignition of high-pressure CH₄ jets injected into lower pressure heated air. A wide range of pre-combustion air temperatures is considered and detailed chemical kinetics are employed. It is demonstrated that the addition of C₂H₆ and H₂ does not change the main CH₄ oxidisation pathways. The decomposition of these additives provides additional ignition-promoting radicals, and therefore leads to shorter ignition delays. N₂ additives do not alter the CH₄ oxidisation pathways, however, they reduce the amount of CH₄ available for reaction, causing delayed ignition. It is further shown that ignition always occurs in lean mixtures and at low scalar dissipation rates. The second study is concerned with the modelling of a piloted CH₄/air turbulent jet flame. A detailed assessment of several Probability Density Function (PDF), Conditional Scalar Dissipation Rate (CSDR) and Conditional Velocity (CV) submodels is first performed. The results of two β-PDF-based implementations are then presented. The two realisations differ by the modelling of the CSDR. Homogeneous (inconsistent) and inhomogeneous (consistent) closures are considered. It is shown that the levels of all reactive scalars, including minor intermediates and radicals, are better predicted when the effects of inhomogeneity are included in the modelling of the CSDR. The two following studies are focused on the consistent modelling of a lifted H₂/N₂ turbulent jet flame issuing into a vitiated coflow. Two approaches are followed to model the PDF. In the first, a presumed β-distribution is assumed, whereas in the second, the Presumed Mapping Function (PMF) approach is employed. Fully consistent CV and CSDR closures based on the β-PDF and the PMF-PDF are employed. The homogeneous versions of the CSDR closures are also considered in order to assess the effect of the spurious sources which stem from the inconsistent modelling of mixing. The flame response is analysed over a narrow range of coflow temperatures (Tc). The stabilisation mechanism is determined from the analysis of the transport budgets in mixture fraction and physical spaces, and the history of radical build-up ahead of the stabilisation height. The β-PDF realisations indicate that the flame is stabilised by autoignition irrespective of the value of Tc. On the other hand, the PMF realisations reveal that the stabilisation mechanism is susceptible to Tc. Autoignition remains the controlling stabilisation mechanism for sufficiently high Tc. However, as Tc is decreased, stabilisation is achieved by means of premixed flame propagation. The analysis of the spurious sources reveals that their effect is small but non-negligible, most notably within the flame zone. Further, the assessment of several H₂ oxidation mechanisms show that the flame is very sensitive to chemical kinetics. In the last study, a DCMC method is proposed for the treatment of fluctuations in non-premixed and partially premixed turbulent combustion. The classical CMC theory is extended by introducing a normalised Progress Variable (PV) as a second conditioning variable beside the mixture fraction. The unburnt and burnt states involved in the normalisation of the PV are specified such that they are mixture fraction-dependent. A transport equation for the normalised PV is first obtained. The doubly-conditional species, enthalpy and temperature transport equations are then derived using the decomposition approach and the primary closure hypothesis is applied. Submodels for the doubly-conditioned unclosed terms which arise from the derivation of DCMC are proposed. As a preliminary analysis, the governing equations are simplified for homogeneous turbulence and a parametric assessment is performed by varying the strain rate levels in mixture fraction and PV spaces.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Packaging and Characterization of a NbTiN Superconducting Nanowire for the Design of an Optimal Nanowire Meander Structure</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Scotland, Antonio</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The Superconducting Nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) made with niobium-titanium nitride (NbTiN) thin films fabricated on oxidized silicon substrates are highly promising nanodevices. The SNSPD is an immensely capable infrared single photon detector. When cooled down with liquid helium the device exhibits high detection efficiency, low dark-counts in spite of fast response times, and low timing jitter. For good single-photon sensitivity at telecom wavelengths, picosecod timing resolutions (&lt;100 ps), and high counting frequencies, the SNSPD is first choice compared to the alternatives like indium gallium arsenide avalanche diode detectors, silicon single photon avalanche diode detectors, and other superconducting single photon technology like, transition edge detectors. These SNSPD characteristics make it ideal for long distance quantum key distribution (QKD). Although the exploitation of the constructive interference that occurs at the SiO2/Si interface can boost detector efficiency, efficient packaging and fiber coupling is often a limiting factor in the overall system quantum efficiency (SQE). In an attempt to maximize SQE, we use a controlled expansion alloy for optimal performance at cryogenic temperatures. This nickel-iron alloy has a high relative permeability and, therefore, attenuates electromagnetic interference. Our report focuses on the theoretical and experimental methods used in the characterization of an un-patterned NbTiN superconducting nanowire. We use simulations based on the gathered experimental data to design an optimal SNSPD meander and calculate its expected SQE. We also use simulations to analyze the speed and value added to secure key rates in long distance QKD schemes up to 400 km with down-conversion sources with positively spectrally correlated and decorrelated photon pairs at 1550 nm wavelength.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Terahertz Sensors Using Surface Waves in Periodic Metallic Structures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Amarloo, Hadi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Terahertz range of frequency has found a fast growing number of applications in material characterization and sensing, imaging and extreme bandwidth communication. Different structures have been proposed for sensing at these frequencies. Surface plasmon waves have successfully been applied to ultra-high precision sensing at optical frequencies, because of their strong field confinement and enhancement. These waves are not as confined in THz due to metal properties over this range of frequencies. However, it has been shown that surface waves on properly designed periodic metallic structure have behavior very similar to plasmonic waves in optical range. These surface wave modes are called surface plasmon-like waves. Here we consider several periodic metallic structures, which support these surface plasmon-like modes, for THz sensing applications. The first one is a two dimensional array of metallic rods which is excited by prism. Many existing plasmonic sensing configurations use prism for plasmonic wave excitation. However, prism is too bulky for integration. Interests in integrated surface plasmonic devices at optical frequencies have been growing recently. As compared with free space configuration, integrated structures have distinct advantages such as small size and multi-channel sensing capabilities. An integrated sensing configuration using plasmonic-like wave is proposed. The new configuration uses a metallic grating that acts as a THz waveguide with a stop-band with a sharp transition edge. Excitation of such metallic grating waveguide through a dielectric waveguide will be described and analyzed. Moreover, it will be shown that the frequency of the transition edge between pass-band and stop-band is highly sensitive to the refractive index of the surrounding medium, and therefore it can be used for dielectric sensing. The excitation requirements of the proposed sensor and its sensitivity will be presented.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Spacetime Approach to Defining Vacuum States and Entropy</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kouchekzadeh Yazdi, Yasaman</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We apply a recent proposal for a distinguished ground state of a quantum field in a globally hyperbolic spacetime to the free massless scalar field in a causal diamond in two-dimensional Minkowski space. We investigate the two limits in which the Wightman function is evaluated (i) for pairs of points that lie in the centre of the diamond (i.e. far from the boundaries), and (ii) for pairs of points that are close to the left or right corner. We find that in the centre, the Minkowski vacuum state is recovered, with a definite value of the infrared cutoff. Interestingly, the ground state is not the Rindler vacuum in the corner of the diamond, as might have been expected, but is instead the vacuum of a flat space in the presence of a static mirror on that corner. We confirm these results by numerically evaluating the Wightman function of a massless scalar field on a causal set corresponding to the continuum causal diamond. We also present an independent calculation of the entanglement entropy for a free massless scalar field in 1+1 dimensions. We use a recent formula for a global expression of entropy using Green functions of the theory. This formula is independent of a density matrix with respect to a hypersurface (as the usual definition of entropy depends on), and it is applicable to both continuum spacetimes and to discrete causal sets. We compute the entanglement entropy in a spacetime of two causal diamonds in the continuum and in a causal set, in the limit that one is much larger than the other. In the continuum, we obtain the result S=1/3ln(ℓ/ɑ)+c, where ɑ is the UV cutoff of the theory, ℓ is the diameter of the smaller diamond, and c is a constant. This result is in agreement with results in CFT.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dispersion-cancelled imaging with chirped laser pulses</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mazurek, Michael</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis deals with chirped-pulse interferometry, an interferometric imaging technique with a resolution which is unaffected by the normally detrimental effects of sample dispersion. The thesis begins with some important background definitions and concepts. The properties of ultrafast laser pulses are discussed, and the nonlinear process of sum-frequency generation is defined. Three different interferometric imaging systems introduced, namely optical coherence tomography, quantum optical coherence tomography, and chirped-pulse interferometry. Understanding the first two techniques is key to realizing the benefits provided by the third. In the first experiment a chirped-pulse interferometer is used to image the cells of an onion. This is the first time that a dispersion-cancelled technique has been used to image the interior structure of a biological sample. Laser pulses centred on 810 nm with 90 nm full-width at half-maximum bandwidth are chirped with a spatial light modulator in a 4f-system to create a superposition of frequency-anticorrelated pulses. The chirped pulses are sent into a cross-correlator with a sample of onion in one arm. The cellular structure of the onion is imaged to a depth of 0.5 mm with a resolution of 3.2 ± 0.6 μm. The introduction of 132 fs² of quadratic dispersion in front of the sample does not affect the resolution of the image. A three-dimensional image of the sample's internal structure is created. The second experiment uses a nonlinear chirping function to produce a narrower interference signal in a chirped-pulse interferometer than that given by linearly-chirped pulses; this competes with the inherently narrower signal seen in quantum optical coherence tomography systems. The nonlinear chirping function theoretically narrows the interference signal by 30%, matching the width of the quantum signal. Experimentally, a narrowing of 17% was observed. The nonlinear chirping function was shown to cancel the 132 fs² of unbalanced quadratic dispersion as effectively as the linear function. One of the main sources of background noise in a chirped-pulse interferometer is a narrow-band component of sum-frequency generated light from the interferometer's intense reference beam. This background is at the same frequency and has the same bandwidth as the signal. A third experiment is proposed in which the light in the sample and reference arms of the interferometer is chirped independently. If the light in both arms is a superposition of frequency-anticorrelated pulses with different average frequencies the interferometer should still be dispersion-cancelling, but the narrowband background will shift spectrally from the signal.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Due to the increased demand for high-operating-speed systems and ultra-compact optical devices, nanophotonic waveguides such as plasmonic waveguides have been a subject of intense interest over the past few years. The ability of plasmonic waveguides to guide light within nano-scale structures beyond the diffraction limit has driven researchers in different fields to exploit their unique features. Even though plasmonic waveguides have shown a strong mode confinement at nano-scale dimensions, they have high propagation loss. Consequently, many geometries and structures have been proposed to investigate ways to reduce this loss. The most recent type of plasmonic waveguide that shows high mode confinement and low propagation loss compared with the other types is the hybrid plasmonic waveguide (HPW). An HPW consists of a low-index dielectric layer sandwiched between a high-index dielectric material and a metal layer; the mode is predominantly confined within the low-index layer. This thesis addresses the use of HPWs for nonlinear applications such as optical switching devices based on the nonlinear phenomenon known as the Kerr effect, where the sub-wavelength dielectric layer has a pronounced nonlinear response. Using Finite Element Method analysis, the nonlinear hybrid plasmonic waveguide (NLHPW) is modeled, and the performance of the NLHPW has been investigated by using appropriate figures of merit to measure the Kerr nonlinearity of the NLHPW with and without the linear loss of the waveguide. These are shown to compare favourably with those of alternate waveguiding geometries. Moreover, the NLHPW has been shown a good balance between mode confinement and loss; small effective mode areas of 0.04 – 0.15 µm2 at a wavelength of λ=1.55 µm and relatively long propagation lengths of 30 to 160 µm can be realized, which make NLHPWs promising candidates for nonlinear applications. As a result, a nonlinear ring resonator with a radius of 1 µm based on the NLHPW is designed and investigated numerically by using frequency domain simulations. It is found that the field intensity in the ring is enhanced four times higher than the field intensity in the input waveguide, and that a nonlinear resonance shift is realized when changing the intensity of the data signal.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Thermal Expansion Coefficient Study of Several Magnetic Spin Materials via Capacitive Dilatometry</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Liu, Kevin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The work presented in this thesis detail the measurement of the thermal expansion coefficient of three magnetic spin materials. Thermal expansion coefficient values were measured by capacitive dilatometry in several key low (T &lt; 250 K) temperature regions specific to each material. This thesis is separated into several key parts. The first part establishes the theory behind observing phase transitions through the thermal expansion coefficient. Beginning with the classical definitions of the specific heat, compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient, the three properties are related using a property known as the Grüneisen parameter. To first order, the parameter allows phase transitions to be observed by the thermal expansion coefficient. The second part introduces capacitive dilatometry; a technique used to measure the thermal expansion coefficient. Three capacitive dilatometer devices are presented in this section. The silver compact dilatometer, the fused quartz dilatometer and the copper dilatometer. Each device discusses merits and weaknesses to their designs. Particular focus is made on the fused quartz dilatometer which was built during the duration of this thesis. The third part presents research on three magnetic spin materials; LiHoF4, Tb2Ti2O7 and Ba3NbFe3Si2O14. These materials are studied individually focusing on specific aspects. LiHoF4, a candidate material for the transverse field Ising model, provides insight to quantum phase transitions. Thermal expansion coefficient and magnetostriction along the c-axis for T ≈ 1.3-1.8 K and transverse field Ht ≈ 0-4 T were measured extracting critical points for a Ht-T phase diagram. Existing thermal expansion coefficient measurements had evidence of possible re-entrant behaviour. With a high density of low transverse field critical points it was established that LiHoF4 showed no evidence of re-entrant behaviour. The highly debated material Tb2Ti2O7 has a rich, controversial low temperature behaviour. Originally believed to be a spin liquid, specific heat results propose a scenario involving a sample composition dependent ordered state. Still under considerably attention, thermal expansion coefficient measurements were performed for T &lt; 1 K. The results are interpreted to either fit into the proposed scenario or provide evidence for an alternate scenario. The material Ba3NbFe3Si2O14 exhibits a magnetoelectric multiferroic phase below TN ≈ 27 K; a phase where magnetic and electric order simultaneously exist. The formation of this phase is believed to have a similar structural shift observed in hexagonal perovskite multiferroic materials. The ferroelectric ordering in those materials are brought about through a centrosymmetric to non-centrosymmetric structural shift. The thermal expansion and thermal expansion coefficient coefficient along the a and c axis are measured for T &gt; TN searching for a displacive structural phase transition.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Holographic Correspondence and Exploring New Regimes of AdS/CFT Duality</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Park, Miok</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>We aim to have a comprehensive understanding of holographic correspondence and to demonstrate how the holographic correspondence (or renormalization) can be applied. Thus this thesis is divided into two parts. The first part is devoted to the former purpose (chapters 1 to 4 including appendix A,B, and C), and the second part is dedicated for the latter purpose (chapter 5 to 7). In Part I, the structure of the AdS/CFT correspondence is analyzed, and the properties of the AdS spacetime is studied in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence; Here, we investigate the isometry group, the conformal structure, and generation of asymptotic solution near the conformal boundary. This solution yields significant convenience for the process of holographic renormalization. Moreover the properties of the Minkowski spacetime are compared to those of the AdS spacetime. To develop a greater understanding of the Lifshitz/quantum critical theory correspondence, the quantum phase transition is studied. Furthermore The holographic renormalization is briefly reviewed. In part II, the holographic renormalization associated with the Mann-Marolf (MM) counterterm is investigated for the asymptotically Minkowski spacetime in (n+3) dimensions. As a boundary condition, the cylindrical coordinate is considered. The solution of the MM-counterterm is obtained by solving the given algebraic equation, and from the counterterm solution, the boundary stress tensor is calculated. It is proven that the formula for conserved quantities via the boundary stress tensor holds. Next, we investigate deformations of Lifshitz holography with the Gauss-Bonnet term in (n+1) dimensional spacetime. To admit the non-trivial solution of the sub-leading orders, a value of the dynamical critical exponent z is restricted by z= n-1-2(n-2)α̃, where is the (redefined) Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. Such solution of sub-leading orders correspond to the marginally relevant modes for the massive vector field and are generated by Λ~0, at the asymptotic region. A generic black hole solution, which is characterized by the horizon flux of the vector field and α̃, is considered in the bulk. We explore its thermodynamic properties, which depend on temperature, by varying n and α̃. As a result, the contribution of the marginally relevant mode is found in a function of Λ^z/T, and the relation between the free energy density and the energy density is numerically recovered when the marginally relevant mode is turned off (Λ=0), is obtained.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Monte Carlo Transport Methods for Semiconductor X-ray Imaging Detectors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Fang, Yuan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis describes the development of a novel comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation code, ARTEMIS, for the investigation of electron-hole pair transport mechanisms in a-Se x-ray imaging detectors. ARTEMIS allows for modeling of spatiotemporal carrier transport in a-Se, combining an existing Monte Carlo simulation package, PENELOPE, for simulation of x-ray and secondary electron interactions and new routines for electron-hole pair transport with three-dimensional spatiotemporal signal output considering the effects of applied electric field. The detector Swank factor, an important imaging performance metric is calculated from simulated pulse-height spectra and shown to depend on incident x-ray energy and applied electric field. Simulation results are compared to experimental measurements and are found to agree within 2%. Clinical x-ray spectra are also used to study detector performance in terms of energy weighting and electronic noise. Simulation results show energy-weighting effects are taken into account in the ARTEMIS model, where the Swank factor and DQE have a higher dependence on the high-energy incident x rays due to increased carrier yield. Electronic noise is found to widen the pulse-height spectra and degrade the Swank factor. The effect of recombination algorithms and burst models are studied. A comparison of a first-hit algorithm and a nearest-neighbor approach shows no significant difference in the simulation output while achieving reduced simulation time. The examination of the initial generation of carriers in the burst shows that the recombination efficiency of carriers is dependent on the carrier density and electric field. Finally, the spatial resolution characteristics of a flat-panel a-Se detector are studied by using the ARTEMIS model for spatial output and image generation. The modulation transfer functions are calculated from simulated detector point response functions for monoenergetic and clinical radiation qualities.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Lattice Boltzmann Method for Simulating Turbulent Flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Koda, Yusuke</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a relatively new method for fluid flow simulations, and is recently gaining popularity due to its simple algorithm and parallel scalability. Although the method has been successfully applied to a wide range of flow physics, its capabilities in simulating turbulent flow is still under-validated. Hence, in this project, a 3D LBM program was developed to investigate the validity of the LBM for turbulent flow simulations through large eddy simulations (LES). In achieving this goal, the 3D LBM code was first applied to compute the laminar flow over two tandem cylinders. After validating against literature data, the program was used to study the aerodynamic effects of the early 3D flow structures by comparing between 2D and 3D simulations. It was found that the span-wise instabilities have a profound impact on the lift and drag forces, as well as on the vortex shedding frequency. The LBM code was then modified to allow for a massively parallel execution using graphics processing units (GPU). The GPU enabled program was used to study a benchmark test case involving the flow over a square cylinder in a square channel, to validate its accuracy, as well as measure its performance gains compared to a typical serial implementation. The flow results showed good agreement with literature, and speedups of over 150 times were observed when two GPUs were used in parallel. Turbulent flow simulations were then conducted using LES with the Smagorinsky subgrid model. The methodology was first validated by computing the fully developed turbulent channel flow, and comparing the results against direct numerical simulation results. The results were in good agreement despite the relatively coarse grid. The code was then used to simulate the turbulent flow over a square cylinder confined in a channel. In order to emulate a realistic inflow at the channel inlet, an auxiliary simulation consisting of a fully developed turbulent channel flow was run in conjunction, and its velocity profile was used to enforce the inlet boundary condition for the cylinder flow simulation. Comparison of the results with experimental and numerical results revealed that the presence of the turbulent flow structures at the inlet can significantly influence the resulting flow field around the cylinder.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Threshold Voltage Instability and Relaxation in Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon Thin Film Transistors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Akhavan Fomani, Arash</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents a study of the bias-induced threshold voltage metastability phenomenon of the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin film transistors (TFTs). An application of gate bias stress shifts the threshold voltage of a TFT. After the bias stress is removed, the threshold voltage eventually returns to its original value. The underlying physical mechanisms for the shift in threshold voltage during the application of the bias and after the removal of the bias stress are investigated.    The creation of extra defect states in the band gap of a-Si:H close to the gate dielectric interface, and the charge trapping in the silicon nitride (SiN) gate dielectric are the most commonly considered instability mechanisms of threshold voltage. In the first part of this work, the defect state creation mechanism is reviewed and the kinetics of the charge trapping in the SiN is modelled assuming a simplified mono-energetic and a more realistic Gaussian distribution of the SiN traps. The charge trapping in the mono-energetic SiN traps was approximated by a logarithmic function of time. However, the charge trapping with a Gaussian distribution of SiN traps results in a more complex behavior.    The change in the threshold voltage of a TFT after the gate bias has been removed is referred to threshold voltage relaxation, and it is investigated in the second part of this work. A study of the threshold voltage relaxation sheds more light on the metastability mechanisms of a-Si:H TFTs. Possible mechanisms considered for the relaxation of threshold voltage are the annealing of the extra defect states and the charge de-trapping from the SiN gate dielectric. The kinetics of the charge de-trapping from a mono-energetic and a Gaussian distribution of the SiN traps are analytically modelled. It is shown that the defect state annealing mechanisms cannot explain the observed threshold voltage relaxation, but a study of the kinetics of charge de-trapping helps to bring about a very good agreement with the experimentally obtained results. Using the experimentally measured threshold voltage relaxation results, a Gaussian distribution of gap states is extracted for the SiN. This explains the threshold voltage relaxation of TFT after the bias stress with voltages as high as 50V is removed.    Finally, the results obtained from the threshold voltage relaxation make it possible to calculate the total charge trapped in the SiN and to quantitatively distinguish between the charge trapping mechanism and the defect state creation mechanisms. In conclusion, for the TFTs used in this thesis, the charge trapping in the SiN gate dielectric is shown to be the dominant threshold voltage metastability mechanism caused in short bias stress times.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Condition Assessment of Cemented Materials Using Ultrasonic Surface Waves</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kirlangic, Ahmet Serhan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Mechanical waves provide information about the stiffness and the condition of a medium; thus, changes in medium conditions can be inferred from changes in wave velocity and attenuation. Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods based on ultrasonic waves are often more economical, practical and faster than destructive testing. Multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) is a well-established surface wave method used for determination of the shear-wave profile of layered medium. The MASW test configuration is also applicable to assess the condition of concrete elements using appropriate frequency range. Both attenuation and dispersion of ultrasonic waves can be evaluated by this technique. In ultrasonic testing, the characterization of a medium requires the precise measurement of its response to ultrasonic pulses to infer the presence of defects and boundary conditions. However, any ultrasonic transducer attached to a surface affects the measured response; especially at high frequencies. On the other hand, ultrasonic transducers available for engineering application are mostly used to measure wave velocities (travel time method). Therefore, these transducers do not have a flat response in the required frequency range. Moreover, in the case of full-waveform methods, the recorded signals should be normalized with respect to the transfer functions of the transducers to obtain the real response of the tested specimen. The main objective of this research is to establish a comprehensive methodology based on surface wave characteristics (velocity, attenuation and dispersion) for condition assessment of cemented materials with irregular defects. To achieve the major objective, the MASW test configuration is implemented in the ultrasonic frequency range. The measured signals are subjected to various signal processing techniques to extract accurate information. In addition, a calibration procedure is conducted to determine the frequency response functions (FRF) of the piezoelectric accelerometers outside their nominal frequency range. This calibration is performed using a high-frequency laser vibrometer. This research includes three main studies. The first study introduces the calibration approach to measure the FRFs of the accelerometers outside of their flat frequency range. The calibrated accelerometers are then used to perform MASW tests on a cemented-sand medium. The original signals and the corrected ones by eliminating the effect of the FRFs are used to determine material damping of the medium. Although, the damping ratios obtained from different accelerometers are not same, the values from the corrected signals are found closer to the characteristic damping value compared to those from the uncorrected signals. The second study investigates the sensitivity of Rayleigh wave velocity, attenuation coefficient, material damping and dispersion in phase velocity to evaluate the sensitivity of these characteristics to the damage quantity in a medium. The soft cemented-sand medium is preferred as the test specimen so that well-defined shaped defects could be created in the medium. MASW test configuration is implemented on the medium for different cases of defect depth. The recorded signals are processed using different signal processing techniques including Fourier and wavelet transforms and empirical mode decomposition to determine the surface wave characteristics accurately. A new index, ‘dispersion index’, is introduced which quantifies the defect based on the dispersive behaviour. All surface wave characteristics are found capable of reflecting the damage quantity of the test medium at different sensitivity levels. In the final study, the condition assessment of six lab-scale concrete beams with different void percent is performed. The beam specimens involving Styrofoam pellets with different ratios are tested under ultrasonic and mechanical equipment. The assessment produce established in the second study with well-defined defects is pursed for the beams with irregular defects. Among the characteristics, attenuation, P and R-wave velocities and dispersion index are found as the promising characteristics for quantifying the defect volume.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Covariant Natural Ultraviolet Cutoff in Inflationary Cosmology</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chatwin-Davies, Aidan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the field of quantum gravity, it is widely expected that some form of a minimum length scale, or ultraviolet cutoff, exists in nature. Recently, a new natural ultraviolet cutoff that is fully covariant was proposed. In the literature, most studies of ultraviolet cutoffs are concerned with Lorentz-violating ultraviolet cutoffs. The difficulty in making a minimum length cutoff covariant is rooted in the fact that any given length scale can be further Lorentz contracted. It was shown that this problem is avoided by the proposed covariant cutoff by allowing field modes with arbitrarily small wavelengths to still exist, albeit with exceedingly small, covariantly-determined bandwidths. In other words, the degrees of freedom of sub-Planckian modes in time are highly suppressed. The effects of this covariant ultraviolet cutoff on the kinematics of a scalar quantum field are well understood. There is much to learn, however, about the effects on a field’s dynamics. These effects are of great interest, as their presence may have direct observational consequences in cosmology. As such, this covariant ultraviolet cutoff offers the tantalizing prospect of experimental access to physics at the Planck scale. In cosmology, the energy scales that are probed by measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) statistics are the closest that we can get to the Planck scale. In particular, the statistics of the CMB encodes information about the quantum fluctuations of the scalar inflaton field. A measure of the strength of a field’s quantum fluctuations is in turn given by the magnitude of the field’s Feynman propagator. To this end, in this thesis I study how this covariant ultraviolet cutoff modifies the Feynman propagator of a scalar quantum field. In this work, I first calculate the cutoff Feynman propagator for a scalar field in flat spacetime, and then I address the cutoff Feynman propagator of a scalar field in curved spacetime. My studies culminate with an explicit calculation for the case of a power-law Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. This last calculation is cosmologically significant, as power-law FLRW spacetime is a prototypical and realistic model for early-universe inflation. In preparation for studying the covariant cutoff on curved spacetime, I will review the necessary back- ground material as well as the kinematic influence of the covariant cutoff. I will also discuss several side results that I have obtained on scalar quantum field theories in spacetimes which possess a finite start time.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Temporal Dynamics of Polarization and Polarization Mode Dispersion and Influence on Optical Fiber Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Soliman, George</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis examines polarization and polarization mode dispersion (PMD) dynamics in optical fibers as well as the evaluation of probability density functions and bit error rates in a realistic wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical communication systems. In the first part of the thesis, experimental studies of the dynamics of polarization in a dispersion compensation module (DCM) are performed in which mechanical shocks are imparted to several different DCMs by dropping a steel ball on the outer casing at different locations and from different heights and the resulting rapid polarization fluctuations are measured. We provide a theoretical model that accounts for the dynamic birefringence generated due to the impact. Next, an experimental technique is proposed to detect the location of temporal polarization activity in WDM systems. It is demonstrated theoretically and in simulations that measurement of both the PMD vector and the Stokes parameters at the WDM frequencies enables the detection of the location of such activity. Different linear prediction procedures are applied to the differential group delay of an optical fiber link assumed to obey the hinge model. The hinges are modeled as polarization rotators with fixed rotation axes and sinusoidally varying rotation angles. Three prediction methods are investigated and consequently compared: an autoregressive model (AR) with Kalman filter, a pattern imitation method and a Taylor expansion technique. The effect of measurement noise on the prediction horizon is also investigated for each prediction method. Using a physically reasonable stochastic model for the hinges, we derive analytical expressions for the temporal autocorrelation functions of the state of polarization (SOP) and the PMD vector. The obtained analytical results are compared to simulations. Finally, we apply the multicanonical method to the probability density function of received symbols and the symbol error ratio (SER) in a dual polarization quadrature phase shift keyed (DP-QPSK) WDM system. We simulate five co propagating channels at a symbol rate of 10.7 GBaud/s and account for PMD and nonlinear effects. We evaluate the performance of the system for two different cases: single mode fibers with full dispersion compensation at the end of the link, effective large area fibers (LEAF) with full dispersion compensation at the end of the link.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Study of the effect of lateral inhomogeneities on the propagation of Rayleigh waves in an elastic medium</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Nasseri-Moghaddam, Ali</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The use of geophysical testing methods has considerable potential to be a cost effective and accurate technique to assess near-surface soil conditions. Multi channel analysis of surface waves (MASW) test is a geophysical non-intrusive test that uses the dispersive characteristic of Rayleigh waves to estimate low strain shear modulus and damping coefficient of near-surface soil. Also, this technique is used to detect underground voids. Recently, MASW technique has gained more attention, partly because of its ease of use and partly because of the significant improvements in data acquisition systems. The theories of MASW test consider the effect of horizontal soil layering, though the effect of lateral inhomogeneities (i. e. cavities and voids), inclined layering and inverse layering (i. e. a layered system in which the top layers are stiffer than the bottom ones) are not addressed properly in these theories.    The objective of this dissertation is to investigate the effect of lateral inhomogeneities on the propagation of Rayleigh waves in an elastic half-space excited by a transient loading. The results can be applied to locate underground cavities using MASW test and to improve the MASW analysis techniques. In lieu of theoretical solutions, two and three dimensional numerical models are constructed to simulate the MASW test. To assure the quality of the obtained data, numerical models are calibrated with Lamb solution. Voids with different sizes and embedment depths are inserted in the medium. Responses along the surface as well as inside the medium are recorded and analyzed in time, frequency, spatial and frequency-wave number domains. Different material types and sources are used to generalize the results. Afterwards, the combined effect of void and layered systems on the surface responses are studied. To verify the results, experimental field and laboratory data are presented and the trends are compared to the numerical results.    It is found that the void starts to vibrate in response to the Rayleigh wave excitation. Due to the vibration of the void energy partitioning occurs. Part of the incident energy is reflected in the form of Rayleigh wave. Another part is converted to body waves, and spread into the medium. The transferred part of the energy is attenuated and has smaller amplitudes. Finally, a part of energy is trapped in the void region and bounces back and forth between the void boundaries, until it damps. The trapped energy is associated to higher modes of Rayleigh waves and excited Lamb waves. The effect of trapped energy is seen as a region in the vicinity of the void with concentrated energy, in frequency domain. The extents of this region depends on the void size, and the frequency content of the incident energy. Thus, in some cases it is possible to correspond the size of the model to the extents of the region with energy concentration.    A new technique is proposed to determine the location of a void, and estimate its embedment depth. The technique is called Attenuation Analysis of Rayleigh Waves (AARW), and is based on the observed damping effect of the void on the surface responses. For verification, the results are compared to experimental field and laboratory data. The observations are in good agreement with the observed numerical results. Further, the AARW technique showed to be a promising tool for void detection.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Low Temperature Spectroscopy of Solid State Quantum Systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Janitz, Erika</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Control and coupling of individual quantum systems remains an important research area in experimental quantum information. Single quantum systems in the solid state offer many attractive properties in terms of isolation and control: strong interaction due to close proximity, and scalability using mature fabrication techniques. Similar to atoms, many solid state quantum systems can couple to photons, offering potential for long-range interaction. Two such candidate systems are the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond, and the nanowire semiconductor quantum dot. These systems can act like isolated atoms in a solid state system, and can serve as sources of indistinguishable photons. This report discusses low temperature excitation of these systems, a regime in which the spectral properties are desirable for applications in quantum information, such as long-distance entanglement.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental Investigation into Spatial Quantum Optical Properties for Satellite Targeting through the Turbulent Atmosphere</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pugh, Christopher</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A major field of research at the current time is that of implementing Quantum Key Distribution over large distances using satellites. If this protocol works with this technology, it will have huge implications on future information security. In order for a satellite to implement this idea, there are many aspects that must be taken into account. One of the big issues that comes up for this type of system is that of propagating light through the turbulent atmosphere and its effects on the acquisition, pointing and tracking system. The projects studied in this thesis study some of the effects of the atmosphere on certain detectors, try to develop pointing schemes for better accuracy as well as develop knowledge in free space propagation of other single photon experiments. In the first experiment, I study the spatial correlations of the daughter photons created in spontaneous parametric down conversion. I look at the effect of altering the pump beam on the positions of the down converted photons and see if the pump can be manipulated in a way to control the directions of the daughter photons. I begin to utilize a deformable mirror and Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor which are generally used in adaptive optics, but we plan to use them to alter the pump beam in the spontaneous parametric down conversion process to analyze the correlations between the pump and down converted photons. The second experiment investigates the effects of laser scintillation on the performance of a possible tracking device that could be implemented on a satellite. This quad sensor tracks the position of a beam and a system will be developed to move the sensor to keep the beam in the center where there is a hole for the quantum single photons to stream through. In order to create the effects of scintillation, a turbulence simulator box was built and characterized. This box combines wind turbulence with a heat gradient to mimic atmospheric turbulence on a small scale. Finally, my contributions to a large scale, long distance free space quantum optics experiment are explained and the overall goal of the experiment is discussed. This experiment exposed me to actual free space transmission issues as well as many fundamental techniques for performing long distance optics experiments. In this experiment there was no correction for atmospheric turbulence, but in the future, techniques could be implemented which might increase the efficiencies of the free space links.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Magnetic and Structural Investigation of Manganese Doped SnO_2 and In_2 O_3 Nanocrystals</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sabergharesou, Tahereh</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Diluted magnetic semiconductor oxides (DMSOs) have received great attention recently due to their outstanding applications in optoelectronic and spintronic devices. Ever since the initial observation of ferromagnetism at room temperature in cobalt-doped titania, extensive effort is concentrated on preparation of transition metal doped wide band gap semiconductors, especially Mn- doped ZnO. Compared to Mn-doped ZnO, magnetic interactions in SnO! and In!O! semiconductors have been underexplored. SnO! and In!O! semiconductors have many applications, owing to their high charge carrier density and mobility as well as high optical transparency. Investigation on electronic structure changes induced by dopants during the synthesis procedure can effectively influence magnetic interactions between charge carriers. In this work, a combination of structural and spectroscopic methods was used to probe as-synthesized SnO! and In!O! nanocrystals doped with Mn!! and Mn!! as precursors. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy are powerful techniques to explore formal oxidation state of manganese dopant, electronic environment, number of nearest neighbors around the absorbent, and bond lengths to the neighboring atoms. Analysis reveals the presence of multiple oxidation states in the doped nanocrystals, and establishes a relation between !"!! ratio and expansion or contraction of lattice parameters. !"!! Although doping semiconductors are crucial for manipulating the functional properties, the influence of dopants on nanocrystals structure is not well understood. Nanocrystalline films prepared from colloidal Mn-doped SnO! and In!O! nanocrystals through spin coating process exhibit ferromagnetic behavior in temperatures ranging from 5 K to 300 K. Magnetic transformation from paramagnetic in free-standing Mn-doped nanocrystals to strong ferromagnetic ordering in nanocrystalline films is attributed to the formation of extended structural defects, e.g., oxygen vacancies at the nanocrystals interface. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) studies clearly show that Mn!! occupies different symmetry sites in indium oxide, when bixbyite and rhombohedral In!O! nanocrystals (NCs) are compared.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Integration of Nanostructures and Quantum Dots into Spherical Silicon Solar Cells</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Esfandiarpour, Behzad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In order to improve the optical losses of spherical silicon solar cells, new fabrication designs were presented. The new device structures are fabricated based on integration of nanostructures into spherical silicon solar cells. These new device structures include: spherical silicon solar cells integrated with nanostructured antireflection coating layers, spherical silicon solar cells with hemispherical nanopit texturing, and cells integrated with colloidal quantum dots. Silicon spheres were characterized by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), single-crystal x-ray diffraction and x-ray powder diffraction to establish the crystallinity nature of the silicon spheres. Furthermore, the material properties of silicon spheres including surface morphology, microwave photoconductivity decay lifetime, and impurity elemental distributions were studied. Silicon nitride antireflection coating layers were developed and deposited onto the spherical silicon solar cells, using a PECVD system. A low temperature hydrogenation plasma technique was developed to improve the passivation quality of the spherical silicon solar cells. The spectral response of silicon spheres with and without a silicon nitride antireflection coating was studied. We have successfully developed and integrated a nanostructured antireflection coating layer into spherical silicon solar cells. The nanostructured porous layer consists of graded-size silicon nanocrystals and quantum-size Si nanoparticles embedded in an oxide matrix. This layer has been characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Scanning tunneling TEM, energy filtered TEM, transmission electron diffraction (TED), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). We developed a novel technique of electrochemical etching for silicon surface texturing using a liquid-phase deposition of oxide mask. Using a focus ion-beam (FIB) technique, cross-sectional TEM samples were prepared to investigate the nature of texturing and the composition of the deposited mask. The hemispherical nanopit texturing was successfully integrated into spherical silicon solar cells and the etching mechanisms and the chemical reactions were discussed. CdSe colloidal quantum dots with diameter of about 2.8nm were integrated into a graded-density nanoporous layer. This structure was implemented on the emitter of the spherical silicon solar cells and the spectral response with and without incorporation of QDs was studied.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Plasmonic Superconducting Single Photon Detector</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Eftekharian, Amin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A theoretical model with experimental verification is presented to enhance the quantum efficiency of a superconducting single-photon detector without increasing the length or thickness of the active element. The basic enhancement framework is based on: (1) Utilizing the plasmonic nature of a superconducting layer to increase the surface absorption of the input optical signal. (2) Enhancing the critical current of the nanowires by reducing the current crowding at the bend areas through optimally rounded-bend implementation. The experimental system quantum efficiency and fluctuation rates per second are assessed and compared to the proposed theoretical model. The model originated from an accurate description of the different liberation mechanisms of the nano-patterned superconducting films (vortex hopping and vortex-antivortex pairing). It is built complimentary to the existing, well-established models by considering the effects of quantum confinement on the singularities' energy states. The proposed model explains the dynamics of singularities for a wide range of temperatures and widths and describe an accurate count rate behavior for the structure. Furthermore, it explains the abnormal behaviors of the measured fluctuation rates occurring in wide nano-patterned superconducting structures below the critical temperature. In accordance to this model, it has been shown that for a typical strip width, not only is the vortex-antivortex liberation higher than the predicted rate, but also quantum tunneling is significant in certain conditions, and cannot be neglected as it has been in previous models. Also it is concluded that to satisfy both optical guiding and photon detection considerations of the design, the width and the thickness of the superconducting wires should be carefully determined in order to maintain the device sensitivity while crossing over from the current crowding to vortex-based detection mechanisms.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Design, Analysis, and Characterization of Indirectly-pumped Terahertz Quantum Cascade Lasers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Razavipour, Seyed Ghasem</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Quantum cascade laser (QCL), as a unipolar semiconductor laser based on intersubband transitions in quantum wells, covers a large portion of the Mid and Far Infrared electromagnetic spectrum. The frequency of the optical transition can be determined by engineering the layer sequence of the heterostructure. The focus of this work is on Terahertz (THz) frequency range (frequency of 1 - 10 THz and photon energy of ~ 4 - 40 meV), which is lacking of high power, coherent, and efficient narrowband radiation sources. THz QCL, demonstrated in 2002, as a perfect candidate of coherent THz source, is still suffering from the empirical operating temperature limiting factor of T ≈ ħω/kB, which allows this source to work only under a cryogenic system. Most of high performance THz QCLs, including the world record design which lased up to ~ 200 K, are based on a resonant phonon (RP) scheme, whose population inversion is always less than 50%. The indirectly-pumped (IDP) QCL, nicely implemented in MIR frequency, starts to be a good candidate to overcome the aforementioned limiting factor of RP-QCL. A rate equation (RE) formalism, which includes both coherent and incoherent transport process, will be introduced to model the carrier transport of all presented structures in this thesis. The second order tunneling which employed the intrasubband roughness and impurity scattering, was implemented in our model to nicely predict the behavior of the QCL designs. This model, which is easy to implement and fast to calculate, could help us to engineer the electron wavefunctions of the structure with optimization tools. We developed a new design scheme which employs the phonon scattering mechanism for both injecting carrier to the upper lasing state and extracting carrier from lower lasing state. Since there is no injection/extraction state to be in resonance with lasing states, this simple design scheme does not suffer from broadening due to the tunneling. Finally, three different THz IDP-QCLs, based on phonon-photon-phonon (3P) scheme were designed, grown, fabricated, and characterized. The performance of those structures in terms of operating temperature, threshold current density, maximum current density, output optical power, lasing frequency, differential resistance at threshold, intermediate resonant current before threshold, and kBT/ħω factor will be compared. We could improve the kBT/ħω factor of the 3P-QCL design from 0.9 in first iteration to 1.3 and the output optical power of the structure from 0.9 mW in first design to 3.4 mW. The performance of the structure in terms of intermediate resonant current and the change in differential resistance at threshold was improved.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Application of Particle Image Velocimetry in a Small Scale Wind Tunnel</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sperandei, Bryan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This study investigated the applicability of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) as a velocity measurement technique for use in wind tunnel flows. To carry out the investigation, a small scale wind tunnel was designed and built to be used specifically with PIV. The tunnel employed a novel contraction geometry which was compared to six other contraction designs using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package. The wind tunnel configuration allowed for full optical access in the test section to allow for PIV measurements in three dimensions. The calibration and characterization of the flow quality within the wind tunnel were performed using PIV. Velocity measurements were obtained in the empty test section to assess the degree of uniformity, alignment, and turbulence at various test speeds. The longitudinal velocities were found to deviate by an average of 1. 8% along any given velocity profile. The flow was found to be well aligned with the test section walls, deviating by no more than ±0. 20° in most cases. As well, the turbulence levels in the test section were found to be low, with average intensities of 2. 0% and 0. 5% in the longitudinal and transverse directions, respectively. Following the characterization of the flow in the empty wind tunnel, a square cylinder was placed in the test section and PIV measurements were performed at a Reynolds number of 21,400. Mean velocities and turbulence intensities measured around the square cylinder were found to compare well with previous works conducted at similar Reynolds numbers in water flows. As a final validation of the wind tunnel/PIV system, measurements were made of the flow over a 1:18 scale Formula One racecar model at a free stream velocity of 40  m/s . The PIV system collected a large quantity of velocity information around the model, providing insight into the aerodynamic aspects of racecars such as downforce devices and vehicle draughting. The experiments performed in this study led to the conclusion that PIV is indeed a measurement technique with high potential for use in small wind tunnels, providing more spatially resolved velocity data than any other known measurement technique. The advancement of digital camera technology will make PIV a more practical measurement technique for use in larger wind tunnels as well.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Spectral Analysis of Wave Propagation Through a Polymeric Hopkinson Bar</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Salisbury, Christopher</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The importance of understanding non-metallic material behaviour at high strain rates is becoming ever more important as new materials are being developed and used in shock loading applications. Applying conventional methods for high strain rate testing to non-metallic materials proved ineffective due to impedance mismatch between the specimen and apparatus and so a new test method was developed. A polymeric Hopkinson bar was developed enabling non-metallic materials, such as polycarbonate and rubber, to be tested at strain rates from 500 s^-1 to 4000 s^-1. Conventional Hopkinson bar analysis is invalid due to the viscoelastic nature of the polymeric bar material. As waves propagate along the bar length, the inherent material behaviour causes the waves to undergo a degree of attenuation and dispersion. Through the use of spectral analysis, a comparison of the dispersive relationships for 6061 T-6 aluminium, extruded acrylic and low density polyethylene is presented. The application of spectral methods to viscoelastic wave analysis was validated by three separate methods. A comparison of predicted and measured waves along the bar length allowed the dispersive relationship to be substantiated. The use of an enhanced laser velocity system further verified the predicted wave magnitude. A comparison of results for polycarbonate and ballistic gelatin to published results showed good agreement.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Tunable Two-Color Ultrafast Yb:Fiber Chirped Pulse Amplifier: Modeling, Experiment, and Application in Tunable Short-Pulse Mid-Infrared Generation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hajialamdari, Mojtaba</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, I have developed a tunable two-color two-stage ultrafast Yb:fiber chirped pulse amplifier for the generation of short-pulse mid-infrared (MIR) radiation in the long-wavelength side of the "molecular fingerprint" (2.5-25 μm) using difference frequency generation (DFG) technique. The two colors called blue and red are in the wavelengths 1.03-1.11 μm and are amplified simultaneously in the same Yb-doped fiber amplifier (YDFA) stages in order to reduce the induced environmental noise on the phase difference of the pulses and to minimize the complexity and system cost. I will present numerical simulations on the two-stage YDFA system to amplify a two-color spectrum in the wavelengths 1.03-1.11 μm. The first and second YDFA called preamplifier and main amplifier are single-clad, single-mode and double-clad, single-mode YDFA respectively. From numerical simulations, the optimal length of the preamplifier to have equal power at two colors centered at 1043 nm and 1105 nm are in agreement with experimental results. It is well known that the power of MIR radiation generated by difference frequency mixing of two wavelengths scales up with the product of mixing powers in a fixed-field approximation. Furthermore, for the gain narrowing effect on the short-wavelength side of the YDFA gain profile, the spectral bandwidth of the blue color decreases resulting in pulse broadening. In addition, for the two colors separated largely, the amplified spontaneous emission is intensified. Considering the cited factors, I will present the modeling results on the two-color, two-stage YDFA system that the product of the power of the two colors is maximized for a maximized wavelength separation between the two mixing colors and a minimized gain narrowing on the blue color in order to build an as broadly tunable and powerful as possible ultrafast mid-infrared source by difference frequency mixing of the two colors. In this research, I achieved a wavelength separation as broad as 71 nm between pulses centered at 1038 nm and 1109 nm from the two-color ultrafast YDFA system. I achieved combined average powers of 2.7 W just after the main amplifier and 1.5 W after compressing the two-color pulses centered at 1041 nm and 1103 nm to nearly Fourier transform limited pulses. From autocorrelation measurements, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the compressed two-color pulses with the peak wavelengths of 1041 nm and 1103 nm was ~500 fs. By mixing the tunable two-color pulses in a 1-mm-thick GaSe crystal using DFG technique, I achieved tunable short-pulse MIR radiation. In this research, I achieved short-pulse MIR radiation tunable in the wavelengths 16-20 μm. The MIR tuning range from the lower side was limited to the 16 μm because of the 71-nm limitation on the two-color separation and from the upper side was limited to the 20 μm because of the 20-μm cutoff absorption wavelength of GaSe. Based on measured MIR spectra, the MIR pulses have a picosecond pulse duration in the wavelengths 16-20 μm. The FWHM of measured spectra of the MIR pulses increases from 0.3 μm to 0.8 μm as the MIR wavelength increases from 16 μm to 20 μm. According to Fourier transform theory, the FWHM of the MIR spectra corresponds to the bandwidth of picosecond MIR pulses assuming that the MIR pulses are perfectly Fourier-transform-limited Gaussian pulses. In this research, I achieved a maximum average power of 1.5 mW on short-pulse MIR radiation at the wavelength 18.5 μm corresponding to the difference frequency of the 500-fs two-color pulses with the peak wavelengths of 1041 nm and 1103 nm and average powers of 1350 mW and 80 mW respectively. Considering the gain bandwidth, Ti:sapphire is a main competitor to the YDFA to be used in the two-color ultrafast laser systems. In the past, the broad gain bandwidth of Ti:sapphire crystal has resulted in synchronized two-color pulses with a wavelength separation up to 120 nm. Apart from its bulkiness and high cost, Ti:sapphire laser system is limited to a watt-level output average power at room temperature mainly due to Kerr lensing problem that occurs at high pumping powers. In comparison, YDFA as a laser amplifier has a narrower gain bandwidth but it is superior in terms of average power. Optical parametric generation (OPG) and optical parametric amplification (OPA) techniques are two competitors to DFG technique for the generation of short-pulse long-wavelength MIR radiation. Although OPG offers a tunability range as broad as DFG, the MIR output power is lower because of the absence of input signal pulses. From the OPA technique, the tunability range is not as broad as the DFG technique due to limitations with the spectral bandwidth of the optical elements. Currently, quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are the state-of-art MIR laser sources. At the present time, the tunability range of a single MIR QCL is not as abroad as that achieved from the DFG technique. More, mode-locked MIR QCLs are not abundant mainly because of the fast gain recovery time. Thus, the generation of widely tunable short-pulse MIR radiation from DFG technique such as that developed in this thesis remains as a persistent technological solution. The application of the system developed in this thesis is twofold: on one hand, the tunable two-color ultrashort pulses will find applications for example in pump-probe ultrafast spectroscopy, short-pulse MIR generation, and optical frequency combs generation. On the other hand, the short-pulse MIR radiation will find applications for example in time-resolved MIR spectroscopy to study dynamical behavior of large molecules such as organic and biological molecules.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Microwave near-field probes to detect electrically small particles</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ren, Zhao</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Microwave near-field probes (MNPs) confine evanescent fields to regions that are substantially smaller than the wavelength at the operation frequency. Such probes are able to resolve subwavelength features, thus providing resolution much higher than the classical Abb?? limit. These abilities of MNPs are primarily due to the evanescent nature of the field generated at the tip of the probes. In the past, MNPs with ultra-high resolution were designed by tapering a resonant opening to provide high field concentration and high sensitivity. The limitations of these MNPs were subject to low surface roughness and practical realization challenges due to their geometrical features and vibration control constraints. Metamaterials with their ability to enhance evanescent fields, lead to the speculation that they could potentially increase the sensitivity of near-field probe. Periodically arranged metamaterial unit elements such as split-ring-resonators (SRRs) can create negative permeability media. Placing such material layer in the proximity of a probe leads to enhancement of the evanescent waves. Guided by this remarkable feature of metamaterials, I proposed an MNP consisting of a wire loop concentric with a single SRR. The evanescent field behavior of the probe is analyzed using Fourier analysis revealing substantial enhancement of the evanescent field consistent with metamaterial theory predictions. The resolution of the probe is studied to especially determine its ability for sub-surface detection of media buried in biological tissues. The underlying physics governing the probe is analyzed. Variations of the probe are developed by placement of lumped impedance loads. To further increase the field confinement to smaller region, a miniaturized probe design is proposed. This new probe consists of two printed loops whose resonance is tunable by a capacitor loaded in the inner loop. The sensing region is decreased from ??/20 to ??/55, where ?? is the wavelength of the probe???s unloaded frequency. The magnetic-sensitive nature of the new probe makes it suitable for sensing localized magnetostatic surface resonance (LMSR) occurring in electrically very small particles. Therefore, I proposed a sensing methodology for detecting localized magnetostatic surface (LMS) resonant particles. In this methodology, an LMS resonant sphere is placed concentrically with the loops. A circuit model is developed to predict the performance of the probe in the presence of a magnetic sphere having Lorentz dispersion. Full-wave simulations are carried out to verify the circuit model predictions, and preliminary experimental results are demonstrated. The Lorentzian fit in this work implies that the physical nature of LMSR may originate from spin movement of charged particle whose contribution to effective permeability may be analogous to that of bound electron movement to effective permittivity in electrostatic resonance. Detection of LMSR can have strong impact on marker-based sensing applications in biomedicine and bioengineering.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Stratified Flow Over Topography: Steady Nonlinear Waves, Boundary Layer Instabilities, and Crater Topography</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Soontiens, Nancy</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis investigates several aspects of stratified flow over isolated topography in ocean, lake, and atmospheric settings. Three major sub-topics are addressed: steady, inviscid internal waves trapped over topography in a pycnocline stratification, topographically generated internal waves and their interaction with the viscous bottom boundary layer, and flow over large-scale crater topography in the atmosphere. The first topic examines the conditions that lead to very large internal waves trapped over topography in a fluid with a pycnocline stratification. This type of stratification is connected to ocean or lake settings. The steady-state Euler equations of motion are used to derive a single partial differential equation for the isopycnal displacement in supercritical flows under two conditions: a vertically varying background current under the Boussinesq approximation and a constant background current under non-Boussinesq conditions. A numerical method is developed to solve these equations for an efficient exploration of parameter space. Very large waves are found over depression topography when the background flow speed is close to a limiting value. Variations in the background current are examined, as well as comparisons between Boussinesq and non-Boussinesq results. The second topic aims to extend the above subject by considering unsteady, viscous flows. Once again, supercritical flow over topography in a pycnocline stratification generates internal waves. These internal waves interact with the viscous bottom boundary layer to produce bottom boundary instabilities. The three-dimensional aspects of these instabilities are studied under changes in viscosity. The boundary layer instabilities have important implications for sediment transport in the coastal oceans or lakes. Lastly, the final topic is motivated by the connection between dust streaks on the Martian surface and crater topography. Flow over a large 100-km diameter crater is examined with numerical simulations conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Modifications to the stratification and topography are applied. It is found that a large hydraulic structure of amplitude comparable to the crater depth forms in many cases. This structure may have important implications for dust transport in the atmosphere. In addition, Martian atmospheric parameters are used to study the flow properties under Mars-like conditions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Direct generation of three-photon entanglement using cascaded downconversion</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hamel, Deny R</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>High quality entangled photon sources are a key requirement for many promising quantum optical technologies. However, the production of multi-photon entangled states with good fidelity is challenging. Current sources of multi-photon entanglement require the use of post-selection, which limits their usefulness for some applications. It has been an open challenge to create a source capable of directly producing three-photon entanglement. An important step in this direction was achieved with the demonstration of photon triplets produced by a new process called cascaded downconversion, but these previous measurements were not sufficient to show whether these photons were in an entangled state and only had detection rates of five triplets per hour. In this thesis, we show the first demonstration of a direct source of three-photon entanglement. Our source is based on cascaded downconversion, and we verify that it produces genuine tripartite entanglement in two degrees of freedom: energy-time and polarization. The energy-time entanglement is similar to a three-particle generalization of an Einstein-Podolski-Rosen state; the three photons are created simultaneously, yet the sum of their energies is well defined, which is an indication of energy-time entanglement. To prove it, we use time-bandwidth inequalities which check for genuine tripartite entanglement. Our measurements show that the state violates the inequalities with what constitute, to the best of our knowledge, the strongest violation of time-bandwidth inequalities in a tripartite continuous-variable system to date. We create polarization entanglement by modifying our experimental setup so that two downconversion processes producing orthogonally polarized triplets interfere to create Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. By using highly efficient superconducting nanowire single photon detectors, we improve the detected triplet rate by 2 orders of magnitude to 660 triplets per hour. We characterize the state using quantum state tomography, and find a fidelity of 86\% with the ideal state, beating the previous best value for a three-photon entangled state fidelity measured by tomography. We also use the state to perform two tests of local realism. We violate the Mermin and Svetlichny inequalities by 10 and 5 standard deviations respectively, the latter being the strongest violation to date. Finally, we show that, unlike previous sources of tree-photon entanglement, our source can be used as a source of heralded Bell pairs. We demonstrate this by measuring a CHSH inequality with the heralded Bell pairs, and by reconstructing their state using quantum state tomography.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Short-wave vortex instabilities in stratified flow</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bovard, Luke</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Density stratification is one of the essential underlying physical mechanisms for atmospheric and oceanic flow. As a first step to investigating the mechanisms of stratified turbulence, linear stability plays a critical role in determining under what conditions a flow remains stable or unstable. In the study of transition to stratified turbulence, a common vortex model, known as the Lamb-Chaplygin dipole, is used to investigate the conditions under which stratified flow transitions to turbulence. Numerous investigations have determined that a critical length scale, known as the buoyancy length, plays a key role in the breakdown and transition to stratified turbulence. At this buoyancy length scale, an instability unique to stratified flow, the zigzag instability, emerges. However investigations into sub-buoyancy length scales have remained unexplored. In this thesis we discover and investigate a new instability of the Lamb-Chaplyin dipole that exists at the sub-buoyancy scale. Through numerical linear stability analysis we show that this short-wave instability exhibits growth rates similar to that of the zigzag instability. We conclude with nonlinear studies of this short-wave instability and demonstrate this new instability saturates at a level proportional to the cube of the aspect ratio.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Toward Canonical General Relativity in the Loop Gravity Phase Space</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ziprick, Jonathan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The continuous, kinematical Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity is built upon a family of spaces $\mathcal{H}_\Gamma$, each associated to a different \textit{graph} $\Gamma$, i.e. a network of interconnected one-dimensional links $\l$, embedded within a spatial geometry. The kinematics of loop quantum gravity are well-established, but difficult problems remain for the dynamics. There are two steps in getting to the quantum theory from the classical one: first, the embedded graphs are used to define a smearing of the continuous gravitational fields to obtain a holonomy $h_\l$ and flux $\X_\l$ for each link of the graph, giving a phase space $P_\Gamma$; second, this phase space is quantized to yield a finite dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_\Gamma$. The intermediate classical theory in terms of $P_\Gamma$ phase spaces remains largely unexplored, and here we endeavour to develop it. If we can find such a theory that is consistent with general relativity, then we will have a theory of gravity based upon finite-dimensional phase spaces that is nicely set up for quantization \`a la loop quantum gravity. To begin, we first review the basic elements of the quantum theory before introducing the classical phase space structure. Within this framework we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the data on a graph and an equivalence class of continuous geometries. We find that a particular member of each class, the spinning geometry, makes a promising candidate as a gauge choice to represent the $(h_\l, \X_\l)$ data in the continuous theory, helping us to formulate a dynamics for the discrete theory. Considering all of the possible graphs, it is important to know how we can evolve from one phase space into another, and how the dynamics in $P_\Gamma$ relates to the continuous evolution. There is a geometrical description of phase spaces where dynamics appears as a class of subspaces within a symplectic manifold. We use this picture to formulate a dynamics between $P_\Gamma$ phase spaces, and demonstrate this process on a simple model that mimics the case of full gravity. Following this, we study a system of point particles in three-dimensional gravity which provides an illuminating demonstration of what we hope to accomplish for full gravity. We develop the classical theory of point particles and show that it can be described by an evolving triangulation where discrete bistellar flips can occur. From here we define the loop gravity theory and show that it agrees with the continuous theory, having two-to-two moves on the graph which mirror the bistellar flips in the triangulation. The results are promising for finding a dynamics for four-dimensional loop gravity, and if the full theory is developed further, we expect it will lead to a breakthrough in the quantum dynamics.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Nanowire Quantum Dots as Sources of Single and Entangled Photons</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Khoshnegar Shahrestani, Milad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Realization of linear quantum computation and establishing secure quantum communication among interacting parties demand for triggered quantum sources delivering genuine single and entangled photons. However, the intrinsic energy level spectrum of nanostructures made by the nature or developed under a random growth process energetically lacks the expected figures of merit to produce such quantized states of photons. Here, I present the semi-empirical modeling and experimental investigation on the spin fine structure of strongly confining quantum dots embedded in III-V nanowires. To this end, the quantum dot is numerically modeled via the Configuration Interaction method at two different levels: 1) single-particle level, where its pure energy level structure is resolved in the presence of strain and spin-orbit interaction. 2) Few-particle level, at which the few-body interactions appear as perturbative energy corrections and orbital correlations. I demonstrate the influence of quantum confinement on the binding energies and spin fine structure of excitons in the absence of hyperfine interaction. Importantly, the high-symmetry character of excitonic orbitals in nanowire quantum dots restore the degeneracy of optically-active ground-state excitons, offering an ideal spectrum for the entangled photon pair generation. To experimentally verify the idea, we design and fabricate defect-free nanowire quantum dots with ultra-clean excitonic spectrum, and construct the time correlation function of emitted photons through performing a series of low-temperature statistical quantum optics measurements. We observe a decent performance in terms of single photon generation under low excitation powers. Moreover, photon pairs emitted from the biexciton-exciton cascade of nanowire quantum dots exhibit color indistinguishability and polarization entanglement owing to the trivial fine structure splitting of the ground-state excitons. We further extend the idea by proposing the hybridized states of a nanowire-based quantum dot molecule as the potential source of higher-order entangled states. Tracing the field-dependent spectrum suggests the appearance of dominant features under the weak localization of electrons and coherent tunneling of holes. In addition to their Coulomb correlation, excitons also remain spatially correlated, opening new transition channels normally forbidden in the ground state of a single dot. The proposed structure can be exploited to create tripartite hybrid, GHZ and W-entangled states.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Ultrafast coincidence characteristics of entangled photons towards entangled two-photon absorption</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gunther, Aimee Kirsten</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Nonlinear optics has had extensive application into a vast array of scientific fields. One such nonlinear process, two-photon absorption (TPA), has had a wildly successful adoption into the field of biological imaging and microscopy. As far and as fast as this field is progressing, limitations stemming from the use of ultrafast lasers are starting to appear. In this work, an alternative nonclassical light source will be motivated for the application of low photon-flux two-photon microscopy. The origin and properties of the chosen nonclassical source, spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), will be discussed along with the spatial and spectral properties modelled. Nonlinear processes such as TPA and sum frequency generation (SFG) will be viewed as "ultrafast coincidence measurements" of two photons arriving at a molecule within the time window of excitation. These ultrafast coincidence measurements will be viewed in an alternative manner: in terms of the second-order coherence from a light source. This degree of second-order coherence can be subdivided into two categories arising from different combinations of correlations within and between entangled photon pairs. Of interest, the energy-time correlations within the photon pair allow for enhancements in ultrafast coincidence rates over coherent light sources. The makings of an experimental setup to demonstrate enhanced rates from ultrafast two-photon coincidences taking place in SFG in a nonlinear crystal will be discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Later Stages of Transition over a NACA0018 Airfoil at a Low Reynolds Number</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kirk, Thomas</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The later stages of separated shear layer transition within separation bubbles developing over a NACA0018 airfoil operating at a chord Reynolds number of 105 and at angles of attack of 0, 5, 8, and 10 degrees were investigated experimentally in a wind tunnel. Several experimental tools, including a rake of six boundary-layer hot-wire anemometers, were used to perform measurements over the model. Novel high-speed flow visualization performed with a smoke-wire placed within the separated shear layer showed that roll-up vortices are shed within separation bubbles forming on the suction side of the airfoil. The structures were found to convect downstream and eventually break down during laminar-to-turbulent transition. Top view visualizations revealed that, at angles of attack of 0, 5, and 8 degrees, roll-up vortices form coherently across the span and undergo significant spanwise deformations prior to breaking down. At angles of attack of 5 and 8 degrees, rows of streamwise-oriented structures were observed to form during vortex breakdown. Statistics regarding the formation and development of shear layer roll-up vortices were extracted from high-speed flow visualization sequences and compared to the results of boundary layer measurements. It was found that, on the average, roll-up vortices form following the initial exponential growth of unstable disturbances within the separated shear layer and initiate the later stages of transition. The onset of these nonlinear stages was found to occur when the amplitude of velocity disturbances reached approximately 10% of the free-stream velocity. The rate of vortex shedding was found to fall within the frequency band of the unstable disturbances and lie near the central frequency of this band. The formation of vortices has been linked to the generation of harmonics of these unstable disturbances in velocity signals acquired ahead of mean transition. Once shed, vortices were found to drift at speeds between 33% and 44% of the edge velocity. Vortex merging at an angle of attack of 5?? was investigated. It was found that the majority of roll-up vortices proceed to merge with either one or two other vortices. Vortex merging between two and three vortices was found to occur periodically in a process similar to vortex merging in plane mixing layers undergoing subharmonic forcing of the most amplified disturbance. The flapping motion of the separated shear layer was investigated by performing a cross-correlation analysis on the high-speed flow visualization sequences to extract vertical displacement signals of the smoke within the shear layer. The frequency of flapping was found to correspond to the unstable disturbance band. At an angle of attack of 5??, it was found that the separated shear layer has a low-frequency component of flapping that matches a strong peak in velocity and surface pressure spectra that lies outside the unstable disturbance frequency band. The spanwise development of disturbances was assessed in the aft portion of the separation bubbles by performing a cross-correlation analysis on signals acquired simultaneously across the span with the rake of hot-wires. The spanwise correlations between signals was found to be well-correlated ahead of shear layer roll-up, after which disturbances became rapidly uncorrelated ahead of mean reattachment. These results were found to be linked to the coherent roll-up and subsequent breakdown of roll-up vortices.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical Simulation of Blast Interaction with the Human Body: Primary Blast Brain Injury Prediction</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Haladuick, Tyler</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, explosions accounted for 81% of all injuries; this is a higher casualty percentage than in any previous wars. Blast wave overpressure has recently been associated with varying levels of traumatic brain injury in soldiers exposed to blast loading. Presently, the injury mechanism behind primary blast brain injury is not well understood due to the complex interactions between the blast wave and the human body. Despite these limitations in the understanding of head injury thresholds, head kinematics are often used to predict the overall potential for head injury. The purpose of this study was to investigate head kinematics, and predict injury from a range of simulated blast loads at varying standoff distances and differing heights of bursts. The validated Generator of body data multi-body human surrogate model allows for numerical kinematic data simulation in explicit finite element method fluid structure interaction blast modeling. Two finite element methods were investigated to simulate blast interaction with humans, an enhanced blast uncoupled method, and an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eularian fully coupled method. The enhanced blast method defines an air blast function through the application of a blast pressure wave, including ground reflections, based on the explosives relative location to a target; the pressures curves are based on the Convention Weapons databases. LBE model is efficient for parametric numerical studies of blast interaction where the target response is the only necessary result. The ALE model, unlike classical Lagrangian methods, has a fixed finite element mesh that allows material to flow through it; this enables simulation of large deformation problems such as blast in an air medium and its subsequent interaction with structures. The ALE model should be used when research into a specific blast scenario is of interest, since this method is more computationally expensive. The ALE method can evaluate a blast scenario in more detail including: explosive detonation, blast wave development and propagation, near-field fireball effects, blast wave reflection, as well as 3D blast wave interaction, reflection and refraction with a target. Both approaches were validated against experimental blast tests performed by Defense Research and Development Valcartier and ConWep databases for peak pressure, arrival time, impulse, and curve shape. The models were in good agreement with one another and follow the experimental data trend showing an exponential reduction in peak acceleration with increasing standoff distance until the Mach stem effect reached head height. The Mach stem phenomenon is a shock front formed by the merging of the incident and reflected shock waves; it increases the applied peak pressure and duration of a blast wave thus expanding the potential head injury zone surrounding a raised explosive. The enhanced blast model was in good agreement with experimental data in the near-field, and mid-field; however, overestimated the peak acceleration, and head injury criteria values in the far-field due to an over predicted pressure impulse force. The ALE model also over predicted the response based on the head injury criteria at an increased standoff distance due to smearing of the blast wave over several finite elements leading to an increased duration loading. According to the Abbreviated Injury Scale, the models predicted a maximal level 6 injury for all explosive sizes in the near-field, with a rapid acceleration of the head over approximately 1 ms. There is a drastic exponential reduction in the insult force and potential injury received with increasing standoff distance outside of the near-field region of an explosive charge.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Quantum Field Theory (QFT) provides the essential background for formulating the standard model of elementary particles and, moreover, practically all other theories attempting to explore the physical laws of nature at the sub-atomic level. One of the main observables in QFT are the scattering amplitudes, physical quantities which encode the information of the scattering process of particles. Accordingly, having authentic, well-defined and feasible prescriptions for the calculations of amplitudes is of huge importance to theoretical physicists. Actual calculations show that the text-book prescription, the Feynman method, besides in general being very cumbersome also hides some of the beautiful mathematical features of amplitudes. The last decade has seen tremendous efforts and achievements to improve such calculations, particularly in supersymmetric gauge theories, which have also led to better understanding of QFT itself. Among the known physically and mathematically interesting quantum field theories is perturbative gravity and its supersymmetric version, N=8 supergravity- much less understood than gauge theory. Following the developments in gauge theory, this dissertation mainly aims at exploring scattering amplitudes in gravity as a quantum field theory, using the modern approaches to QFT. The goal is not only to improve our understanding of gravity amplitudes by applying part of the known modern methods of calculations to it but also to introduce and develop new ones.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fundamental Characteristics of Turbulent Opposed Impinging Jets</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Stan, Gheorghe</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A fundamental study of two turbulent directly opposed impinging jets in a stagnant ambient fluid, unconfined or uninfluenced by walls is presented. By experimental investigation and numerical modeling, the main characteristics of direct impingement of two turbulent axisymmetric round jets under seven different geometrical and flow rate configurations (L*= L/d = { 5, 10, 20 }, where L is nozzle to nozzle separation distance and d is nozzle diameter, and Re = { 1500, 4500, 7500, 11000 }) are discussed. Flow visualization and velocity measurements performed using various laser based techniques have revealed the effects of Reynolds number, Re, and nozzle to nozzle separation, L, on the complex flow structure. Although locally valid, the classical analysis of turbulence is found unable to provide reliable results within the highly unstable and unsteady impingement region. When used to simulate the present flow, the assessment of the performance of three distinct k - epsilon turbulence models showed little disagreement between computed and experimental mean velocities and poor predictions as far as turbulence parameters are concerned.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Design and Characterization of Silicon-on-Insulator Passive Polarization Converter with Finite-Element Analysis</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Deng, Henghua</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>As optical fiber systems evolve to higher data rates, the importance of polarization control and manipulation steadily increases. Polarization manipulating devices, such as polarization splitters and converters, can be realized by introducing material anisotropy or geometric asymmetry. Compared to active devices, passive polarization converters are more simply fabricated and controlled; therefore they have attracted increasing attention during the past two decades. However, materials employed in previous polarization rotating waveguides are mainly limited to low index-contrast III-V semiconductors such as InP and GaAs. Such III-V devices possess large radiation loss, large curvature loss, and low coupling efficiency to single-mode fibers; in addition, due to the weak optical confinement, the device spacing has to be large, which prevents high-density and large-scale integration in optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEIC) and planar lightwave circuits (PLC).    In this dissertation, the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology is introduced to the design and fabrication of passive polarization rotators (PR). Efficient and accurate full-vectorial finite-element eigenmode solvers as well as propagation schemes for characterizing novel SOI PRs are developed because commercial software packages based on finite-difference techniques are inefficient in dealing with arbitrary waveguide geometries.    A set of general design procedures are accordingly developed to design a series of slanted-angle polarization converters, regardless of the material system (SOI or III-V), outer-slab layer configuration (symmetric or asymmetric), and longitudinal loading (single- or multi-section). In particular, our normalized design charts and simple empirical formula for SOI polarization converters are applicable to a wide range of silicon-guiding-film thickness, e. g. , from 1 to 30 μm, enabling fast and accurate polarization rotator design on most commercial SOI wafers. With these procedures, in principle 100% polarization conversion efficiency can be achieved by optimizing waveguide geometric parameters.    A novel configuration with asymmetric external waveguiding layers is proposed, which is advantageous for fabrication procedure, manufacturing tolerance, single-mode region, and conversion efficiency. By etching along the crystallographic plane, the angled-facet can be perfectly fabricated. Completely removing external waveguiding layer beside the sloped sidewall not only simplifies production procedures but also enhances fabrication tolerances.    To accurately and efficiently characterize asymmetric slanted-angle SOI polarization converters, adaptive mesh generation procedures are incorporated into our finite-element method (FEM) analysis. In addition, anisotropic perfectly-matched-layer (PML) boundary condition (BC) is employed in the beam propagation method (BPM) in order to effectively suppress reflections from the edges of the computation window. For the BPM algorithm, the power conservation is strictly monitored, the non-unitarity is thoroughly analyzed, and the inherent numerical dissipation is reduced by adopting the quasi-Crank-Nicholson scheme and adaptive complex reference index.    Advantages of SOI polarization rotators over III-V counterparts are studied through comprehensive research on power exchange, single-mode condition, fabrication tolerance, wavelength stability, bending characteristics, loss and coupling properties. The performance of SOI PRs is stable for wavelengths in the ITU-T  C -band and  L -band, making such devices quite suitable for DWDM applications. Due to the flexible cross-section of SOI polarization converters, the coupling loss to laser diodes and single mode fibers (SMF) can be designed to be very small and can be further reduced by a tapered waveguide with cross-sections always satisfying the single-mode criteria. Slanted-angle SOI polarization rotators display asymmetric bending characteristics and permit extremely small curvatures with negligible radiation loss when the angled-facet is located at the outer bend radius. Moreover, SOI polarization rotators can be manufactured with low-price processing techniques that are fully compatible with CMOS integrated circuits (IC) technology, and thus can be integrated on both photonic and electronic chips.    Experimental verifications have shown good agreement with theoretical analysis and have confirmed the promising characteristics of our novel asymmetric SOI polarization converters. Similar asymmetric-outer-slab geometry has recently been employed by peer researchers to fabricate high performance III-V polarization rotators. We therefore believe that results in this dissertation will contribute much to related research fields.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Orthogonal Separation of The Hamilton-Jacobi Equation on Spaces of Constant Curvature</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rajaratnam, Krishan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>What is in common between the Kepler problem, a Hydrogen atom and a rotating black- hole? These systems are described by diﬀerent physical theories, but much information about them can be obtained by separating an appropriate Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The separation of variables of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is an old but still powerful tool for obtaining exact solutions. The goal of this thesis is to present the theory and application of a certain type of conformal Killing tensor (hereafter called concircular tensor) to the separation of variables problem. The application is to spaces of constant curvature, with special attention to spaces with Euclidean and Lorentzian signatures. The theory includes the general applicability of concircular tensors to the separation of variables problem and the application of warped products to studying Killing tensors in general and separable coordinates in particular. Our ﬁrst main result shows how to use these tensors to construct a special class of separable coordinates (hereafter called Kalnins-Eisenhart-Miller (KEM) coordinates) on a given space. Conversely, the second result generalizes the Kalnins-Miller classiﬁcation to show that any orthogonal separable coordinates in a space of constant curvature are KEM coordinates. A closely related recursive algorithm is deﬁned which allows one to intrinsically (coordinate independently) search for KEM coordinates which separate a given (natural) Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This algorithm is exhaustive in spaces of constant curvature. Finally, suﬃcient details are worked out, so that one can apply these procedures in spaces of constant curvature using only (linear) algebraic operations. As an example, we apply the theory to study the separability of the Calogero-Moser system.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Terahertz Surface Plasmon Resonance Sensor for Material Sensing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Alqarni, Sondos</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Terahertz wave (THz) is comprised of electromagnetic waves carrying frequencies from 0.1 to 30 THz. Terahertz radiation has the ability to interact with a wide range of materials, such as plastic and paper, and to provide low-­‐energy probing of the system's electronic nature, including inter/intra-­‐molecular motions and Debye relaxation -­‐ these are not accessible by other wavelengths. Further appealing feature for THz ray is the nonionizing nature and the distinctive optical response of various materials are important for analyzing diverse applications such as material quality control, pharmaceutical, industrial production lines, and biological. Upon that THz waves have been utilized for imaging and spectroscopy, especially Terahertz Time-­‐Domain Spectroscopy (THz-­‐TDS) associated to its ability in measuring the change in the electric field with high sensitivity in time-­‐domain. Surface plasmon-­‐polaritons (SPPs) at metal-­‐dielectric interfaces have been proven for several decades as a reliable technique for surface analysis and investigation of thin films due to the two dimensional nature of SPPs and the strong electromagnetic field at the interface. Extraordinary transmission of light through subwavelength hole arrays has attracted many areas of applications including optical data storage, near field microscopy, optical displays, and thin film sensing. The enhancement in the tunneled transmission light stemming from the coupling with SPP by the surface configurations has been explored through the waveguide theory and the grating theory of the frequency-­‐selective characteristic of SPP resonances. At THz frequencies, the extraordinary transmission through thin metallic hole arrays has been demonstrated through the excitation of SPP on the metal–dielectric interface confining the incident THz pulse around the holes, hence precluding THz pulse from easily passing and attenuating into the conductor. Implementing THz SPP in thin film sensing has great potential for industrial applications because the two dimensional nature of SPPs and the strong electromagnetic field at the interfacewith the THz natural reaction with the material provides reliable measurements of thin film spectroscopy including optical and dielectric constants, film thickness, and inhomogeneities at interfaces with high precision. This motivates the investigation of the characteristics such as purity of thin organic film including PMMA and those used in organic light emitting diode (OLED) through THz SPR devices. Two SPR devices contain either 2D periodic circular or square hole array in 500 nm Al on an 5 mm-­‐thick intrinsic silicon, or a single subwavelength aperture surrounded by concentric periodic grooves of a set period in a metal plate (which is known as a Bull’s eye structure), and was fabricated by following the micro-­‐ fabrications process encompassed from UV photolithography and wet and dry etching to transfer the pattern into the Al film. The SPR device consisting of 2D periodic circular or square hole array with and without thin Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film on it is placed at the focus of the THz beam in transmission THz-­‐TDS, where the spectrum is obtained from the Fourier-­‐ transformed sample and reference THz pulses. The transmission is obtained from the ratio between the sample spectrum and reference spectrum, whereas the phase change is the phase difference between the two spectra. To avoid overlap with water absorption lines, the optimal SPR device design has a period of 320 μm and square holes of 150 μm side length. We successfully confirmed the theoretical SPR frequencies for metal-­‐silicon mode and demonstrate a shift to 0.9211 THz due to 2 μm of PMMA layer on the surface.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Study of Order-by-Disorder Phenomenon in Frustrated Magnetic Systems Near Criticality</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Javanparast, Behnam</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Order-by-disorder is the phenomenon of the selection of a long-ranged ordered state by fluctuations in a many-body system. This mechanism, at first sight, seems paradoxical, since fluctuations (disorder) intuitively tend to suppress the order. However, when ObD happens, disorder works in favour of a particular ordered phase. Order-by-disorder can happen where an accidental degeneracy occurs in classical or mean field treatment of a system. These degeneracies, which are not due to exact symmetries of the system, can then be lifted by quantum or thermal fluctuations. The ObD phenomenon is ubiquitous in condensed matter systems with competing or frustrated interactions. Traditionally, the ObD is studied at $T = 0^+$ where the ground state of the system can be selected by quantum fluctuations. The study of ObD at temperature regimes near criticality, $T \lesssim Tc$ where transition happens from the paramagnetic phase to an ordered phase, however, have not received as much attention. In this thesis, we study the ObD phenomenon in three dimensional frustrated sys- tems close to criticality. We consider 3-component classical Heisenberg spins on pyrochlore lattice and FCC lattice. In the former, the spins interact via a Hamiltonian that can include the most general nearest-neighbour symmetry allowed bilinear interactions, long- range magnetostatic dipole-dipole interaction and second and/or third nearest-neighbour exchange interactions. However, in the latter, the Hamiltonian only consists of long-range magnetostatic dipole-dipole interactions. These two systems, correspond to insulating rare- earth pyrochlore oxides and rare-earth FCC salts. The mean field treatment shows, that accidental $O(4)$ and $U(1)$ symmetries emerge in two different regions of the parameter space of the Hamiltonian of pyrochlore system. While in the FCC system, an accidental $O(3)$ symmetry emerges at the mean field level. We show that fluctuations break these symmetries by respectively introducing cubic (in 4-vector and 3-vector models) and hexag- onal anisotropies to the free-energy of the system. To study these system beyond mean field approximation, we use Monte Carlo simulations, spin wave theory and we develop the E-TAP method which is an extended version of the method originally proposed by Thouless, Anderson and Palmer to study fluctuations in spin glasses.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Modelling Internal Solitary Waves and the Alternative Ostrovsky Equation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>He, Yangxin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Internal solitary waves (ISWs) are commonly observed in the ocean, and they play important roles in many ways, such as transport of mass and various nutrients through propagation. The fluids considered in this thesis are assumed to be incompressible, inviscid, non-diffusive and to be weakly affected by the Earth's rotation. Comparisons of the evolution of an initial solitary wave predicted by a fully nonlinear model, IGW, and two weakly-nonlinear wave equations, the Ostrovsky equation and a new alternative Ostrovsky equation, are done. Resolution tests have been run for each of the models to confirm that the current choices of the spatial and time steps are appropriate. Then we have run three numerical simulations with varying initial wave amplitudes. The rigid-lid approximation has been used for all of the models. Stratification, flat bottom and water depth stay the same for all three simulations. In the simulation analysis, we use the results from the IGW as the standard. Both of the two weakly nonlinear models give fairly good predictions regarding the leading wave amplitudes, shapes of the wave train and the propagation speeds. However, the weakly nonlinear models over-predict the propagation speed of the leading solitary wave and that the alternative Ostrovsky equation gives the worst prediction. The difference between the two weakly nonlinear models decreases as the initial wave amplitude decreases.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Superconducting Nanostructures for Quantum Detection of Electromagnetic Radiation</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jafari Salim, Amir</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, superconducting nanostructures for quantum detection of electromagnetic radiation are studied. In this regard, electrodynamics of topological excitations in 1D superconducting nanowires and 2D superconducting nanostrips is investigated. Topological excitations in superconducting nanowires and nanostrips lead to crucial deviation from the bulk properties. In 1D superconductors, topological excitations are phase slippages of the order parameter in which the magnitude of the order parameter locally drops to zero and the phase jumps by integer multiple of 2\pi. We investigate the effect of high-frequency ﬁeld on 1D superconducting nanowires and derive the complex conductivity. Our study reveals that the rate of the quantum phase slips (QPSs) is exponentially enhanced under high-frequency irradiation. Based on this ﬁnding, we propose an energy-resolving terahertz radiation detector using superconducting nanowires. In superconducting nanostrips, topological ﬂuctuations are the magnetic vortices. The motion of magnetic vortices result in dissipative processes that limit the efficiency of devices using superconducting nanostrips. It will be shown that in a multi-layer structure, the potential barrier for vortices to penetrate inside the structure is elevated. This results in significant reduction in dissipative process. In superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs), vortex motion results in dark counts and reduction of the critical current which results in low efficiency in these detectors. Based on this ﬁnding, we show that a multi-layer SNSPD is capable of approaching characteristics of an ideal single photon detector in terms of the dark count and quantum efficiency. It is shown that in a multi-layer SNSPD the photon coupling efficiency is dramatically enhanced due to the increase in the optical path of the incident photon.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental Evaluation of Flow-Measurement-Based Drag Estimation Methods</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Neatby, Holly C.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The accuracy of existing methods for estimating the drag based on experimental flow field measurements were assessed for two-dimensional bodies. The effects of control volume boundary placement and inherent simplifying assumptions were also investigated. Wind tunnel experiments were performed on a circular cylinder operating at a Reynolds number of 8,000 and 20,000, and on a NACA 0018 airfoil operating at a chord Reynolds number of 100,000 for three angles of attack (α), specifically, 5◦, 10◦, and 15◦. The circular cylinder experiments fall within the the shear layer transition flow regime. Airfoil investigations span both types of flow development common to low Reynolds number airfoil operation. For α = 5◦ and 10◦, a separation bubble forms on the upper surface of the airfoil, while, for α = 15◦, the flow separates without reattaching, resulting in a stalled airfoil. Wake velocity and pressure measurements were performed at several downstream locations to investigate the impact of control volume boundary placement. Wake profiles were measured between 3 and 40 diameters downstream from the circular cylinder axis and between 1 and 4.5 chord lengths from the trailing edge of the airfoil. In addition to wake profiles, the outer flow velocity variation was quantified to investigate the appropriate location to measure freestream flow characteristics in a test section with streamwise-varying outer flow conditions. The results show that drag estimates are strongly dependent on the streamwise position of the measured wake profile for all methods investigated. Drag estimates improved, and streamwise variation decreased, with increasing streamwise position of the flow measurements. For the pressure based method examined, wake measurements should be taken at least 10 times the projected model height downstream of the model. In the case of the circular cylinder, this is equivalent to 10 diameters and, for the airfoil investigated, it is approximately 1 chord length from the trailing edge. For the methods relying on velocity measurements, acceptable estimates of drag were possible when based on measurements taken at least 30 projected heights downstream, i.e., 30 diameters for the circular cylinder and 3 chord lengths for the airfoil model investigated. The findings highlight the importance of providing a detailed description of the methodology and experimental implementation for drag estimates based on flow field measurements. Finally the study offers guidelines for implementing momentum integral based drag calculations in future investigations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Single Killing Vector Gauss-Bonnet Boson Stars and Single Killing Vector Hairy Black Holes in D&gt;5 Odd Dimensions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Henderson, Laura</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>I construct anti-de Sitter boson stars in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity coupled to a (D-1)/(2)-tuplet of complex massless scalar field both perturbativelyand numerically in D=5,7,9,11 dimensions. Due to the choice of scalar fields, these solutions possess just a single helical Killing symmetry. For each choice of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter α≠α_cr, the central energy density at the center of the boson star, q_0 completely characterizes the one parameter family of solutions. These solutions obey the first law of thermodynamics, in the case of the numerics, to within 1 part in 10^6. I describe the dependence of the boson star mass, angular momentum and angular velocity on α and on the dimensionality. For α&lt;α_cr and D&gt;5, these quantities exhibit damped oscillations about finite central values and the central energy density tends to infinity. The Kretschmann invariant at the center of the boson star diverges in the limit of diverging central energy. This contrasts the D=5 case, where the Kretschmann invariant diverges at a finite value of the central energy density. Solutions where α&lt;α_cr, correspond to negative mass boson stars, and the for all dimensions the boson star mass and angular momentum decrease exponentially as the central energy density tends toward infinity with the Kretschmann invariant diverging only when in the limit the central energy density diverges. I also briefly discuss the difficulties of numerically obtaining single Killing vector hairy black hole solutions and present the explicit boundary conditions for both Einstein gravity and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>We compute the exact partition function of two dimensional N=(2,2) supersymmetric gauge theories on S². For theories with SU(2|1)_A invariance, the partition function admits two equivalent representations corresponding to localization on the Coulomb branch or the Higgs branch, which includes vortex and anti-vortex excitations at the poles. For SU(2|1)_B invariant gauge theories, the partition function is localized to the Higgs branch which is generically a Kähler quotient manifold. The resulting partition functions are invariant under the renormalization group flow. For gauge theories that flow in the infrared to Calabi-Yau nonlinear sigma models, the partition functions for the SU(2|1)_A (resp SU(2|1)_B) invariant theories compute the Kähler potential on the Kähler moduli (resp. complex structure moduli) of the Calabi-Yau manifold. We also compute the elliptic genus of such theories in the presence of Stückelberg fields and show that they are modular completions of mock Jacobi forms.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical Simulations of Undrained Granular Media</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Olivera Bonilla, Roberto Rafael</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The objective of the present study was to develop a fluid flow-coupled distinct element model capable of capturing the undrained behaviour of granular soils by considering fundamental physical mechanisms that involve fluid flow and particle interaction. The method considers granular media as assemblies of ellipsoidal particles arranged on a plane and interacting by means of contact forces. Saturation effects are incorporated by assuming that particles are immersed in fluid, the flow of which is simulated as occurring through a network of conduits. The flow through conduits is according to a Hagen-Poiseuille relation; a transient solution is obtained by solving a system of differential equations. The developed fluid-flow coupled distinct element was used to conduct various numerical simulations and the mechanisms of undrained deformations were examined from a micromechanical point of view. The dissertation begins with a literature review on the undrained behaviour of granular materials as observed in laboratory experiments. A review of previous attempts to simulate undrained tests micromechanically is also presented, and the advantages and disadvantages of various methods are examined. The capability of the developed model to simulate two-dimensional fluid-flow and pressure dissipation problems is demonstrated by means of comparisons with analytical solutions. Fluid pressure dissipation problems are qualitatively compared with Terzaghi's one-dimension theory of consolidation. It is shown that transient flow problems are accurately modelled by the fluid flow network approach. Simulated compression tests were carried out to examine the effects of different confining pressures and initial densities on the macroscopic response. The results compare favorably with those commonly observed in undrained laboratory experiments. Simulated tests are analyzed from a micromechanical point of view. It is shown that macroscopic behaviour can be traced to changes in micromechanical fabric descriptors. The effects of the interparticle friction angle on the undrained behaviour of the assemblies are investigated. The undrained strength is considerably increased by increasing interparticle friction. The main mechanism found to be responsible for the development of higher strength is the tendency of the specimens to dilate during shear distortion. The effects of the principal stress direction on the macroscopic response are examined. The behaviour of initially anisotropic samples is significantly altered by the direction of the principal stresses relative to the anisotropy direction. It is demonstrated that macroscopic permeability of the media has a considerable effect on the strength. This behaviour is attributed to the inhomogeneity of pore pressure distributions which increases with decreased permeability. The results presented are generally in agreement with observations previously reported from laboratory experiments. The possible applications of the model for future research are also discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Modeling of Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer for Optimization of Pin-Fin Heat Sinks</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Khan, Waqar</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this study, an entropy generation minimization procedure is employed to optimize the overall performance (thermal and hydrodynamic) of isolated fin geometries and pin-fin heat sinks. This allows the combined effects of thermal resistance and pressure drop to be assessed simultaneously as the heat sink interacts with the surrounding flow field. New general expressions for the entropy generation rate are developed using mass, energy, and entropy balances over an appropriate control volume. The formulation for the dimensionless entropy generation rate is obtained in terms of fin geometry, longitudinal and transverse pitches, pin-fin aspect ratio, thermal conductivity, arrangement of pin-fins, Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. It is shown that the entropy generation rate depends on two main performance parameters, i. e. , thermal resistance and the pressure drop, which in turn depend on the average heat transfer and friction coefficients. These coefficients can be taken from fluid flow and heat transfer models. An extensive literature survey reveals that no comprehensive analytical model for any one of them exists that can be used for a wide range of Reynolds number, Prandtl number, longitudinal and transverse pitches, and thermal conductivity. This study is one of the first attempts to develop analytical models for the fluid flow and heat transfer from single pins (circular and elliptical) with and without blockage as well as pin-fin arrays (in-line and staggered). These models can be used for the entire laminar flow range, longitudinal and transverse pitches, any material (from plastic composites to copper), and any fluid having Prandtl numbers (≥0. 71). In developing these models, it is assumed that the flow is steady, laminar, and fully developed. Furthermore, the heat sink is fully shrouded and the thermophysical properties are taken to be temperature independent. Using an energy balance over the same control volume, the average heat transfer coefficient for the heat sink is also developed, which is a function of the heat sink material, fluid properties, fin geometry, pin-fin arrangement, and longitudinal and transverse pitches. The hydrodynamic and thermal analyses of both in-line and staggered pin-fin heat sinks are performed using parametric variation of each design variable including pin diameter, pin height, approach velocity, number of pin-fins, and thermal conductivity of the material. The present analytical results for single pins (circular and elliptical) and pin-fin-arrays are in good agreement with the existing experimental/numerical data obtained by other investigators. It is shown that the present models of heat transfer and pressure drop can be applied for a wide range of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, longitudinal and transverse pitches, aspect ratios, and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, selected numerical simulations for a single circular cylinder and in-line pin-fin heat sink are also carried out to validate the present analytical models. Results of present numerical simulations are also found to be in good agreement.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Characteristics of dividing and combining flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhu, Weimin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the present thesis, some aspects of dividing and combining flows are studied. The first part of the study considers the discharge characteristics of flow past a two-dimensional lateral slot located in a rectangular conduit. Existing theoretical solutions to this problem are based on free streamline theory. The test results provide data to verify the predictions of the theoretical model related to the dependence of the slot discharge coefficient on discharge ratios and the ratio of the kinetic energy to the total energy of the flow approaching the slot. The test results validate the model predictions. A theoretical expression for the outflow through a rectangular lateral weir located in a circular open channel is derived. The theoretical weir discharge coefficient is expressed as a function of the parameters relating the geometry of the weir and the channel, and a velocity parameter that is a function of the dimensionless flow depth, the weir sill height and the approach Froude number. Experimental results are presented to verify the proposed theoretical model. The characteristics of dividing flows in closed rectangular conduits are studied in the next section. The contraction coefficient and the loss coefficients of branching flows are determined using results of an existing model dealing with a two-dimensional lateral outlet fitted with an external barrier. For dividing closed conduit flows, two different procedures are used to obtain the variation of an energy loss coefficient and the contraction coefficient with the discharge ratio. Detailed velocity and pressure distribution profiles are presented to describe the flow processes. In the final part of the thesis, the characteristics of combining flows past 90$\sp\circ$ junctions of a rectangular closed conduit are presented. Detailed pressure and velocity distribution data are obtained to understand the flow processes. Both the mean and fluctuating components of the velocity field are determined in the two flow sections immediately downstream of the junction. Simple empirical models are developed to determine the transfer of momentum and the contraction coefficient. Experimental data are used to verify the predicted results of the proposed models</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Ultrasonic circumferential waves in empty and water-filled tubes</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Li, Xing</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Ultrasonic waves propagating in the circumference of elastic isotropic cylindrical shells are theoretically and experimentally studied. Dispersion relations of different circumferential modes, including the SH-type and Lamb-type families, are obtained by solving the wave equations numerically. Asymptotic solutions are also given for the SH-like modes. Various technologies are applied for generating and detecting the circumferential waves. In particular, a new approach is developed for experimental determination of the dispersion of the circumferential waves in cylindrical shells. With a chirp interdigital transducer (IDT) as a broadband transmitter and receiver made on a stainless steel tube coated with piezoelectric film, both the group and phase velocities of the circumferential waves are obtained over a wide frequency range, which covers the most sensitive region of the lowest flexural mode. Other transduction approaches are also used as complementary tools in the experiments. Experiments are carried out on both empty and fluid-loaded cylindrical shells at different frequencies. With the specially developed experimental configuration, propagation of a new flexural wave type in a water-filled tube is observed. Mode conversions are also observed between the A 0 mode in the shell and the compressional waves in the water. The results show good application potentials in liquid level sensing.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Laminar burning velocity measurements of stabilized aluminum dust flames</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Kolbe, Massimiliano</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The laminar burning velocity of a stabilized dust flame is experimentally investigated in the present work. The dust used was aluminum powder with an average particle diameter of approximately 5 microns. Dust flames, in comparison to gas flames, are thicker and brighter, may be influenced by radiation heat transfer, respond differently to heat losses, and are influenced by the particular flow configuration due to the particle's inertia. With the apparent sensitivity to a specific experimental apparatus, the introduction of a fundamental flame speed or burning velocity may be problematic for dust combustion. The present work investigates to what degree burning velocities obtained from Bunsen dust flames depend on experimental conditions (i.e. flow rate and nozzle diameter). The current experimental apparatus permits the stabilization of aluminum-air dust flames using conical nozzles and the accurate measurement of dust concentration. Experimental results show that burning velocities in aluminum-air suspensions increase considerably with the increase in flow rate but decrease with the increase in nozzle diameter. Theoretical estimations show that radiation heat transfer effects are small and cannot explain the observed experimental trends. The present analysis of dust flames shows that the observed effects are primarily the result of flame curvature and of larger flame thickness as compared to gas flames.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Evaluation of the uniform theory of diffraction for edge diffraction at low frequency</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Shukayr, Riman</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis examines the UTD diffraction coefficient's limitations in accuracy for a half plane and a wedge at low frequency. The UTD solutions are developed for scattering by a strip and a square cylinder with diffraction considered as a local phenomenon. Single and multiple diffractions are considered, and both TE and TM polarizations are done. As a benchmark, moment method solutions are developed for the strip and square cylinder. Pulse basis point matching is used after investigating its adequacy: some moment method codes that are available in the open literature were examined; in one instance some modifications were required to obtain satisfactory results. For the infinite edge, comparison is done with modal solutions and Sommerfeld's exact solution. The UTD diffraction solution reduces to Sommerfeld's exact solution when the edge is a half plane and the incident field is a plane wave. The equivalence of these cases is not obvious and is derived as part of this work. Other comparisons are made with results that are available in the literature. It was found that UTD, when multiple diffraction is taken into account, can be used to compute scattered fields and surface currents for scatterers as small as 0.1 n in dimension, with a very high degree of accuracy. This is quite surprising, as UTD is generally expected to only work well with electrically large structures on the order of 1 n in size or larger</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An X- and Q-band electron paramagnetic resonance study of Mn2+ in a single crystal of NH4Cl0.9I0.1 in the temperature range 77-295 K</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rinaldi, Gino</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This work is an electron paramagnetic resonance study of the mixed ammonium chloride-iodide host crystal doped with divalent manganese. The studies presented here were carried out at X-band and Q-band microwave frequencies, and at various microwave cavity temperatures. The resonance spectrum of this crystal is described by a set of spin-Hamiltonian parameters, whose parameters are determined by fitting the various resonance line positions obtained for several angular orientations of the magnetic field relative to the crystal axes. A set of initial parameters is then determined by second-order perturbation theory. These are then rigorously evaluated by a computer subroutine using the least-squares-fitting technique. The spectra obtained through angular variation of the crystal within the static magnetic field confirm the cubic symmetry of the crystal, and the existence of three magnetically equivalent sites having their axes along the [100], [010], and [001] directions. The final set of spin-Hamiltonian parameters were interpreted using the superposition model, which is a mathematical approach used to evaluate the intrinsic parameters of the crystal, based on the sum of nearest neighbor ligand contributions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Wave induced response of sea floor deposits : a simple model for sands and nonlinear analysis by FEM</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yang, Qingshi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This dissertation analyzes the ocean wave-induced response of seafloor deposits. The linear wave theory is introduced for determination of the wave-induced pressure at the mud line. The seafloor deposit is assumed to be a saturated porous medium modelled by a two-phase system. The theory of mixture is used to derive the coupled governing equations. A simple material constitutive model is proposed based on the generalized plasticity-bounding surface formulation. Some comparisons of the model tests with experimental results are made. The simple model is capable of simulating both loose and dense sand behavior under monotonic and cyclic loading, drained and undrained conditions. A nonlinear finite element analysis procedure is presented. A fictitious freedom technique is used to treat the different nodal degrees of freedom due to the composition of coupled fields. A non-symmetric frontal solver subroutine is developed to accommodate the asymmetry due to the non-associated plastic flow rule. A simple artificial boundary is suggested to deal with the unbounded domain, which is easy to implement in the finite element program and universal to apply to nonlinear analysis. One important conclusion obtained from the numerical analyses is the influence of the coefficient of permeability on the susceptibility of the sand mass to liquefaction; for high values of permeability even a loose sand mass need not liquefy. This is in direct contrast to the commonly held view that the liquefaction potential is a function of density only. Two example cases are studied in detail. The first example examines the seabed response to the wave train at a pipeline site in Lake Ontario (Christian et al., 1974; Nataraja and Gill, 1983), where the deposit was measured to be loose and medium dense. The second example investigates the seafloor behavior under a storm wave as the Ekofisk tank site in the North Sea (Lee and Focht, 1975; Nataraja and Gill, 1983). Here the deposit was reported to be dense. The numerical analyses predict the susceptibility of the two sites to liquefaction which reflects the real situations. It helps build confidence in the numerical procedure adopted in this study and lends it credibility.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Feynman rules and static quantities of the charged vector bosons in a left-right supersymmetric extension of the standard model</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pnevmonidis, Pantelis</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The Standard Model is reviewed and its extension is proposed to incorporate left-right symmetry as well as supersymmetry. Model principles are developed to build a gauge theory with supersymmetry and the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) is briefly discussed. The left-right supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model is introduced and the symmetry-breaking pattern is described. The physical vector bosons, the charginos and neutralinos, and the Higgs particles are identified. The Lagrangian terms for the interactions of the vector bosons A, Z L , Z R , W L , W R amongst themselves as well as all corresponding Feynman rules are written down. The interaction Lagrangian terms with three fields are obtained at least one of which is the Photon A or a neutral vector boson Z L or Z R or a charged vector boson W L or W R . Feynamn rules are written down for interactions with three fields at least one of which is the Photon A, or a charged vector boson W L or W R . The Feynman rules are used in order to calculate the anomalous magnetic moments and quadrupole moments of the charged vector bosons W L or W R of the left-right supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Electronic correlations in quantum wires subjected to strong magnetic fields : dependence on the filling factor</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhang, Zhongxi</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Electron-electron interactions and their effects on Landau levels in quantum wires (QWs), subjected to strong perpendicular and parallel magnetic fields, are discussed. For QWs in strong perpendicular magnetic fields, with integral filling factor (p = 1, 2, and 3), the screened Coulomb interactions are assessed by solving the integral equations for the screened potential, both analytically and numerically. Correlation energy strongly smoothens the energy dispersion in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The exchange-correlation contribution [Special characters omitted.] to the Fermi-edge group velocity v g ( k F ) is proved to be nonsingular. The energy dispersion, obtained in the local density approximation (LDA), is in line with the observed strong suppression of the spin splitting (p = 1, 3) and helps in explaining the observed destruction or absence of some quantum Hall states. For QWs in strong parallel magnetic fields, with only the lowest LL occupied, the many-body corrections have a stronger effect on the spin-splitting than in the case of perpendicular magnetic fields.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Monte Carlo study of carbon monoxide layers adsorbed on ionic crystals : structures and phase transition</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Vu, Ngoc-Thanh</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The adsorption of CO on NaCl(100) at monolayer, submonolayer and multilayer coverages, and on LiF(100) at monolayer coverage were studied. The Metropolis Monte Carlo method was used to study the structures of the overlayers and to characterize the phase transitions. The simulations were performed in the temperature range from 1K to 75K. At low temperature and monolayer coverage, both of these systems form ordered phases that become disordered as the temperature is increased. For the CO/NaCl system the estimated transition temperature is between 32K and 35K whereas for CO/LiF a temperature between 40K to 45K is estimated. Below the transition temperatures, both systems have an ordered p(2x1) type structure due to correlated azimuthal orientations. The ordered phases have two molecules per unit cell connected by a glide plane. In the CO/NaCl case the projections of the molecular axes upon the surface are antiparallel. We find that in monolayer of CO/NaCl the molecules are tilted by about 27Å whereas larger tilt angle (k V 44Å) is observed in a monolayer CO/LiF. At high temperatures, both systems undergo a phase transition to an azimuthally disordered p(1x1) phase, i.e. one with no preferred orientation in the surface plane. Yet on average, the molecular axes remain tilted with the surface normal. Evidence for a continuous order-disorder phase transition is found in the form of a characteristic divergence of the heat capacity and susceptibility within the estimated transition temperature range. Coverages of less than a monolayer of the CO/NaCl system have also been studied. The CO molecules are found to aggregate and form islands with an ordered structure in the middle of the islands. Apparently, these islands also undergo an order-disorder transition but at lower temperatures. At high temperatures, gas-solid coexistence in two dimensions is also observed. Simulations of adsorption of multilayer systems are found to destabilize the p(2x1) phase of the bottom layer in favour of a p(1x1) structure with the upper layers adopting the correct orientational ordering of the bulk solid Ì-CO. Nonetheless, the molecules fail to form a correct head-to-tail ordering as in the bulk structure. Preliminary results show that the ability to adopt the correct bulk structure depends upon the number of the layers present in the system. The more layers the system has the better chance the system has to adopt the correct head-to-tail ordering.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>On the decay of strong concentrated columnar vortices</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Aboelkassem, Yasser</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Being able to predict the properties of a decaying vortex is of value to various technological and scientific problems. The hazards presented by the vortices shed by large, heavily loaded, aircraft to an incoming plane are well known. A safe separation distance makes sure that the vortices shed by the first aircraft have been decayed to a level that is safe for the following aircraft. The decay of geophysical vortices is a highly complex phenomenon. Nevertheless, simplified time-dependent vortex models, like the one presented in this thesis, do elaborate on the basic processes involved during the energy dissipative phase. The general approach also provides a method that enables us to study the transient flow development in a plethora of swirling flow problems that evolve by starting or halting a pair of circular cylinders. In the present thesis, a novel analytical method is developed to study the decay of a strong, concentrated vortex. Based on the equations representing the transient fluid motion and using a standard solution formulation via Fourier-Bessel expansions will show that different initial profiles of the velocity produce distinct velocity time distributions. Three initial velocity shapes will be explored here. The first deals with the decay of a potential vortex. This type presents the known theoretical discrepancy of infinite velocity and vorticity in the center at the start. The second case considers an initial velocity distribution of a Rankine's vortex. The latter although possess a continuous velocity and static pressure distributions, it is also theoretically dubious since in this situation the vorticity presents a jump discontinuity at the core radius. The final distribution will assume the Vatistas' n = 2 vortex</dc:description>

          <dc:title>On the flows developed within the gap of two parallel discs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tsifourdaris, Panagiota</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The inflow, or accelerating, or sink flow, is realized when fluid enters the space between two flat discs via the periphery and drains through a centrally located outlet. The flow that is characterized by a monotonically decreasing pressure gradient is known to remain laminar even at very high Reynolds numbers, or to laminarize if the entering fluid is initially turbulent. The outflow, or decelerating, or source flow, is the type of flow where the fluid is admitted through a centrally located inlet and discharged through the periphery. As a result of the area increase, the velocity decreases, and an adverse pressure gradient develops. Analytical and experimental analyses were performed for the inflow and outflow between two discs both with and without swirl. In the analytical study (with and without swirl), it was shown that the radial velocity is expressed only as a function of the radial location and Reynolds number, whereas the static pressure for the swirling flows depends on the Reynolds number, radial position and swirl strength. The analytical model was also validated with present and previously obtained experimental findings and showed good agreement. An experimental investigation was also carried out to explore the flow between two narrowly spaced discs over the range of low and moderate Reynolds numbers. Radial velocity and static pressure measurements were obtained for the non-swirling inflow and outflow, whereas for the swirling cases only static pressures were acquired. The experimental results were then compared with the present theory and showed good agreement. For the inflow case, the results displayed the characteristics of the accelerating flow, whereas for the outflow case without swirl, the vena contracta effects, as well as the phenomenon of the reverse flow at the inlet region were demonstrated</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A finite element conjugate heat transfer method</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Marini, Remo</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The need to accurately predict heat transfer in aircraft anti-icing systems or in turbomachinery cooling passages is a current topic of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). In both applications, the flow structure is highly complex and three-dimensional. The traditional use of correlations might be useful in describing the average heat transfer behavior, but not the localized effects. Accurate heat transfer predictions are required to design efficient complex cooling or heating schemes and only a full 3D Navier-Stokes code, coupled with a solid conduction code, is the sole alternative. Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) is the commonly used term to identify such coupling of convection and conduction across one or several fluid-solid interfaces. The CHT approach proposed in this thesis solves both the fluid and solid thermal fields simultaneously, in a fully-implicit manner using the infrastructure of a 3D Navier-Stokes flow solver, FENSAP. The algorithm supports 3D structured, unstructured, and hybrid meshes, with mismatched node connectivity and with non-uniform grid densities between fluid and solid domains at CHT interfaces. The heat transfer validation is assessed for both laminar and turbulent flows against relevant open literature data. The CHT validation is assessed with three cases: a blunt flat plate flow, a fully-developed pipe flow, and the complex piccolo tube system flow in a 3D nacelle lip. The results show that the proposed method can be used as a reliable and cost-effective tool for the analysis and design of thermal anti-icing devices, and can easily be extended to cooled gas turbine components, such as: blades, vanes, shrouds, and disks.</dc:description>

At the end section of the overfall, the streamline pattern in the vertical plane of channel symmetry can be determined using the measured axial velocity data and the water surface profiles. The streamline pattern permits the evaluation of the streamline curvature, which in turn yields the curvature correction required to obtain the true static pressure profile at the end section. In the region above the maximum velocity point near the end depth, energy relationships determined on the basis of the measured velocity and pressure field data confirm the fact that the total energy is essentially constant. The pressure head coefficient at the end section is a dominant parameter that influences the relationship between the channel discharge and the end depth. Single slit weirs have been recently investigated to show that small discharge rates can be measured accurately by them. This concept has been applied to the flow through multislit weirs. This can extend the capacity of the slit weirs to measure accurately both low and high discharge rates. For this purpose the hydraulic concept of images is used to form a bank of slit weirs whose flow characteristics are essentially similar to the single weir. The multislit weir can accurately measure both very low and very large discharge</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Turbulence characteristics of counter flowing free jets</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Saghravani, Sayed Fazlolah</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Jets are used in several engineering applications including dilution and mixing. The counter flowing free jet was investigated to find the penetration length and geometry of the expanded jet. The turbulence characteristics of the counter flowing free jets have been determined. Several jet nozzles with different diameters were used to form the jet located at the center of a closed conduit that had a square cross section. The results show that the penetration length varies linearly with the ratio of the jet velocity to the main flow velocity that is denoted by R. Axial and radial velocity components were measured simultaneously using a 2-D laser velocity probe. The raw data was processed and several characteristics of the counter flowing free jets such as the decay rate of the jet and the turbulence behavior of the jet along the jet axis are reported. The turbulent kinetic energy of the counter flowing free jets was studied. Several profiles were chosen and the turbulent kinetic energy was balanced along the radial direction of the jet. The terms including pressure component were used as the closure, since the pressure was not measured. Another major part of the study was to find the wake mixing characteristics of the counter flowing free jets. Several tests with different R values were performed and for each test, the concentration of the tracer injected by the jet to the main flow was measured at several points at different cross sections in the near wake region of the jet. The results show that the mixing between the tracer and the main flow improves with larger jet diameter and bigger velocity ratios. A small part of the study was devoted to numerical test using the software code, Phoenics. Three sets of tests using different turbulence models were performed and the results were compared with the measurement. In comparison, for the case of turbulent jets in counter flow, the k-f model gave a better result than k-} and mixing length models. The results can be applied directly to the control of stream pollution, as the counter flowing free jet is a very effective device to dilute the effluents injected in a stream</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical simulation of transient performance of viscous micropumps</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Abdelgawad, Mohamed Omar</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The current trend in today's technology is the miniaturization of the mechanical components to the extent that they are about to compete with the electronics used to control their performance. In the present study, the transient performance of viscous micropumps will be investigated numerically. The viscous micropump operation depends mainly on viscous forces, and can operate in any situation where viscous forces are dominant. It consists of a cylinder placed eccentrically inside a microchannel with its axis perpendicular to the channel axis. When the cylinder rotates, a net force is transferred to the fluid due to the unequal shear stresses on the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder, thus causing the fluid to displace. The effect of the microchannel height, rotor eccentricity, Reynolds number, and pump load on the transient performance of the viscous micropump has been studied in detail. The rotor eccentricity was determined to be the parameter that affected the transient performance of the micropump the most significantly. Multi rotor configurations were also examined and proved to enhance the micropump performance. The steady state performance was compared with the available experimental data and was found to be in a very good agreement. This work provides a foundation for future research on the subject of fluid phenomena in viscous micropumps.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fault recovery in control systems : a discrete event system approach</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Moosaei, Mohammad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Fault recovery is a challenging task that is crucial in achieving stringent reliability and safety goals. In this thesis, the problem of fault recovery is studied in discrete-event systems (DES), assuming permanent failures. A diagnosis system is assumed to be available to detect and isolate faults with a bounded delay. Thus, the combination of the plant and diagnosis system can be thought of having three modes: normal, transient, and recovery. Initially the plant is in the normal mode. Once a failure occurs, the system enters the transient mode. After the failure is diagnosed by the diagnosis system, the system enters the recovery mode. This framework does not depend on the diagnosis technique used, as long as the diagnosis delay is bounded. As a result, the diagnosis and control problems are almost decoupled. In general, for each mode there is a set of specifications that have to be met. We propose a modular switching supervisory scheme. The proposed framework contains one normal-transient supervisor and multiple recovery supervisors each corresponding to a particular failure mode. Once a fault is detected and isolated by the diagnoser, the normal-transient supervisor is removed from the feedback loop and one of the recovery supervisors will take sole control of the system. The issue of non-blocking is studied and it is shown that essentially if the system under supervision is non-blocking in the normal mode, then it will remain non-blocking during the recovery procedure. Supervisor admissibility is also studied. This approach is developed for untimed DES and then extended to timed DES. In the process, previous results on supervisor design for untimed DES with partial observation are extended to timed DES. Various examples from manufacturing and process control are provided to illustrate the approach.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A new image segmentation and smoothing method based on the Mumford-Shah variational model</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gao, Song</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Recently Chan and Vese have developed an active contour model for image segmentation and smoothing. Tsai et al. have also developed a similar approach independently. In this thesis, we develop a new hierarchical method which has many advantages compared to the Chan and Vese multiphase active contour models. First , unlike previous works, the curve evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) for different level set functions are decoupled. Each curve evolution PDE is the equation of motion of just one level set function; and different level set equations of motion are solved in a hierarchy. This decoupling of the motion equations of the level set functions speeds up the segmentation process significantly. Secondly , because of the coupling of the curve evolution equations associated with different level set functions, the initialization of the level sets in Chan and Vese's method is difficult to handle. The hierarchical method proposed in this thesis can avoid the problem due to the choice of initial conditions. Thirdly , we use the diffusion equation for denoising. This method therefore can deal with very noisy images. In general, our method is fast, flexible, not sensitive to the choice of initial conditions, and produces very good results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental and numerical study of the bleed effect on the propagation of strong plane and converging cylindrical shock waves</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>El-Mallah, Mourad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A combined experimental-numerical study was conducted to determine the effect of bleeding on the propagation of plane and converging cylindrical shock waves. A fully 3-D Finite Element code was written for simulating inviscid unsteady flow in various cases of shock tube geometry. The scheme used was implicit time-marching with the Galerkin discretization for spatial coordinate derivatives and multi-step finite difference formulation for time derivatives. Initial trials with 1-D radial flow have shown good agreement with the analytical power law of shock propagation derived by Guderley. The numerical code was first applied to the test case of shock wave strengthening through its reflection from a 15 ̕ramp. The numerical results of the shock front shape were found to be in good agreement with the Schlieren photographs taken for the flow at different time intervals. The numerical code was then applied to the test case of a plane shock interaction with a transverse slit. Experiments were carried out in this case to determine the degree of shock attenuation for shock Mach numbers ranging between 1.2 and 2.5, and slit-duct width ratios varying between 0.25 to 1.0. For this test case, a simplified model--based on the Method of Characteristics and the Chester-Chisnel-Whitham (CCW) theory--was also introduced. Numerical results for the attenuated shock Mach number were found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental results and the approximate analytical model. For the 2-D axisymmetric flows, domains similar to the plane flow cases were used to account for the radial convergence effect. Pressure measurements were also carried out at various radii to determine the pressure time history. The transmitted shock, past the slit, was found to undergo attenuation as in the 2-D case, but combined with strengthening due to area convergence. At the same location downstream of the slit, attenuation was found to be higher than in the 2-D case of similar slit-chamber width ratios.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Mirror Symmetry is Subject to Crowding Across the Visual Field</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Roddy, Gabrielle</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Bilateral mirror symmetry is often thought to be particularly salient to human observers. It has been hypothesized that symmetry engages specialized mechanisms that evolved to sense symmetrical objects in nature. However, although symmetry is a commonly encountered stimulus property, studies have shown that sensitivity to mirror symmetry does not serve an alerting function when embedded in noise (Gurnsey et al., Can Soc Brain Behav Cog Sci, 1998b). Further, sensitivity to symmetry decreases similarly to other common stimuli when targets are presented away from the centre of the visual field (for review: Wagemans, Spat Vis, 1995). The three experiments presented in this thesis show that symmetrical targets are vulnerable to the same interference as other stimuli when surrounded by non-target elements. The data shares many of the common characteristics attributable to the crowding phenomenon in current and historical literature (for review: Whitney &amp; Levi, Trends Cog Sci, 2011). Namely, we find little or no effect of crowding at fixation. The magnitude of the crowding effect increased nonlinearly with eccentricity and at a greater rate than the linear increase of resolution loss (e.g., Gurnsey et al., JoV, 2011; Latham &amp; Whitaker, Ophthalmic Physiol Opt, 1996). In this case, standard double linear size scaling procedures were unable to characterize the data across the visual field and produced untenable results that violate assumptions of the crowding phenomenon. Taken together, the results provide evidence that symmetry is unlikely to be processed in parallel fashion by low-level mechanisms.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This dissertation presents the first attempt to verify the capability of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), a meshfree particle method, to simulate pulsatile flow in the cardiovascular system. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics has been extensively used to simulate astrophysical phenomena, free surface flows and transient start-up of the internal flows under constant driving forces at low Reynolds numbers. However, most of the fluid flow phenomena are naturally unsteady with moderate Reynolds numbers. In this thesis, first, a series of benchmark cases are conducted to address internal oscillating flows at moderate Reynolds numbers. The performance of the two most commonly used formulations to model the diffusing viscous term and the XSPH variant, proposed to modify the movement of the particles, is investigated. The relation between particle resolution and sound speed to control compressibility effects in SPH simulations and the spatial convergence rate of the SPH discretization are examined. Furthermore, a modified formulation for wall shear stress calculations is suggested and an approach to implement inflow and outflow boundary conditions in SPH is introduced. It is also shown how SPH simulations with different particle resolutions exhibit behaviors equivalent to a finite volume scheme of different accuracy orders for moderate Reynolds numbers. The application of SPH to cardiovascular fluid dynamics is extended by simulating pulsatile flow inside a model of the heart’s left ventricle and through normal and dysfunctional prosthetic mechanical heart valves. The SPH simulations result in the realistic calculation of the shear stress loading on the blood components and illustrate the important role played by non-physiological flow patterns to shear-induced hemodynamic events.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Design of a microfluidic chip for three dimensional hydrodynamic focusing in cell cytometry applications</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Anthony, Tony</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The Focusing of cells is an important part of cytometry applications and can be achieved by different techniques. 3D hydrodynamic focusing has generated considerable interest over the last few years, owing to its simplicity and its independence from an electric potential for focusing. Current 3D hydrodynamic focusing devices require multilayer structures necessitating complex fabrication. Moreover, the existing designs show poor efficiencies in focusing. In the present work, three novel 3D hydrodynamic focusing designs consisting of a main channel for sample fluid flow and three pairs of side channels for focusing are proposed and modelled. A novel three dimensional hydrodynamic focusing design is proposed and simulated. In order to develop the numerical model for three dimensional focusing designs, a theoretical review of parameters affecting the fluid flow in microfluidic structure has been performed. Simulation was performed using COMSOL Multiphysics with diluted glycerol as the sample fluid and DI water as sheath flow fluid. The effects of fluid velocities in the channels were studied. In Design III, the overall efficiency is less than that in the first two designs, but the advantage of this design lies in the possibility of a simpler fabrication. Subsequently, parameters such as velocity and viscosity were studied in the case of Design III, and the ideal velocity condition was identified as 150 m/sec for the sample flow, 350µm/sec for the first sheath flow, and 550µm/sec for the second sheath. Simulations were carried out with sample and sheath flow fluids that have different viscosities. It was concluded that the effect of focusing is primarily dependent on the velocity rather than on the viscosity of the fluid.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Discrete-Dipole-Approximation (DDA) study of the plasmon resonance in single and coupled spherical silver nanoparticles in various configurations</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wahbeh, Mamoun</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Using the Discrete-Dipole-Approximation (DDA) the influence of the substrate on the dipole and multipolar plasmon resonances in spherical and sphere-like silver nanoparticles has been studied in depth. The effects of the contact area, the substrate material, the substrate thickness, the surrounding environment and the particle size on the plasmon resonance bands have been examined. We studied in particular the validity of extending the so-called “universal scaling law”, derived for a pair of particles in previous works, to a linear chain of any size consisting of silver nanospheres. Details of the variation of the dipole plasmon resonance parameters with component particle size, interparticle separation and host medium, under parallel and perpendicular polarization directions of the incident light, have been studied in a systematic way. In a two-dimensional array of silver nanospheres, the interparticle separation dependency of the maximum absorption cross-section is presented. The variation of the absorption efficiency has been also investigated as a function of the component particle size and the surrounding medium. The effect of the host medium on the absorption cross-section has been found to be dependent on the component particle size. The sensitivity of the longitudinal dipole plasmon resonance wavelength to the refractive index of the host medium and the component sphere radius has been also expressed as a function of the interparticle separation. Finally, the effect of the direct neighboring particles on the optical responses has been studied for various ensemble configurations, which can be arranged in two-dimensional or three-dimensional arrays.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Instability of Elliptic Liquid Jets</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Amini-Baziani, Ghobad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The motion of liquid jets ejected from elliptical orifices is studied theoretically and experimentally. In the theoretical part of the study, the linear evolution of initially small disturbances on the inviscid jets is investigated using a three-dimensional analysis. In addition, to study the viscous free-surface flows, an approach based on the Cosserat theory (also called directed theory) is used. Temporal and spatial analyses are performed and the dispersion equations of waves on the jet column are derived to show the growth rate of disturbances for different modes under various conditions. An equation for the jet profile is suggested which describes the axis-switching phenomenon and breakup for various conditions. The equations are approximated for small and large ellipticities, and well-known dispersion relations of circular and planar jets are retrieved. It is shown that in the capillary dominant regimes, the effect of ellipticity is increasing the growth rate and range of unstable wavenumbers. In this case only modes symmetric to both major and minor axes are unstable. At higher Weber numbers, as the aerodynamic forces become dominant, by increasing the ellipticity, growth rate is decreased. In these Weber numbers, as the ellipticity increases, the growth rates of the modes that are symmetric with respect to the major axis are larger than those of antisymmetric with respect to the major axis. Increasing the gas to liquid density ratio increases the disturbances growth rate, while increasing the liquid viscosity dampens the growth rate and shifts the maximum growth rate toward longer waves. Experiments are performed to validate the linear results and to investigate the jet velocity profile. Several nozzles with different ellipticities and length to diameter ratios are designed and their behaviors are examined under free (natural) and excited (forced) perturbations. The spatial evolution of the jet shape is captured using a high speed camera. In the forced breakup case, the stimulations are performed by modulating the jet velocity with a piezoelectric actuator through given sinusoidal perturbations. The measured data are in good agreement with theoretical predictions except at high ellipticities where nonlinear effects are strong.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dynamic behavior of microcantilevers subjected to fluid-structure interaction using mode-summation method</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ashtaputre, Pranav</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>ABSTRACT Dynamic behavior of microcantilevers subjected to fluid-structure interaction using Mode Summation method Pranav Ashtaputre Several Microsystems exhibit interaction of flexible structures such as beams, plates, membranes with fluid. Some of these systems are micropumps, flow sensors and micro valves. It is crucial to consider the effects of fluid parameters such as density, viscosity, velocity and pressure loading while designing these systems. The design of these systems demand a numerical model to understand the dynamic behavior of various elements involved in these systems. Microcantilever is an important structure which exhibits interaction with fluids in various microsystems. The present thesis focuses on the numerical modeling of dynamics of a microcantilever vibrating under the action of fluid loading. Natural frequencies and mode shapes of cantilever are obtained using characteristic orthogonal polynomials in the Rayleigh Ritz method. Numerical model is formed by solving Euler Bernoulli Equation of beam using mode summation method with normal modes of cantilever. The excitation frequency and fluid pressures are obtained from experimental results are explored for modeling and verification purposes. The results are obtained for the tip deflection of the beam. The results are validated with the results obtained in earlier experiments. The deflection amplitudes from the numerical model and those from experiment are found to be in agreement with each other. A parametric study is also presented with different sizes of microcantilever. The effect of different lengths and widths of microcantilever on the deflection amplitudes is presented. However, the effect of structural deformation due to the changes in fluid pressure is not considered. The model can be further extended to explore the dynamics of microplate used in micropumps with the help of precise fluid pressure data for a particular dynamic system and mode shapes obtained in free vibration analysis. The model provides the first step towards finding a solution to the problems involving fluid loading on microsystems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical simulation of imploding shock waves</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Amirfazli, Alidad</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A numerical study was made of imploding shock waves. The objective of the present paper is to clarify the propagation and instability of the converging cylindrical and elliptical shock waves. In order to make the simulation, a second order explicit MacCormack type finite difference method was employed to solve the unsteady compressible Euler equations. At first, a one-dimensional simulation was preformed for converging cylindrical shock waves. The results were found to be in good agreement with the Chester, Chisnell and whitham relation. Also, the numerical results were in good agreement with other published 1-D numerical simulations (e.g. method of characteristic). A two-dimensional simulation was also developed for initially perturbed implosions. The governing fluid dynamics equations have been solved in polar coordinates. The 2-D scheme is an extension to the 1-D case, using the operator splitting, where the multi-dimensional solution is evolved from a factored sequence of one dimensional operators. From the two-dimensional study of converging cylindrical shocks, it has been concluded that although the shock has been perturbed initially in the azimuthal direction, it has a tendency to keep its continuous shock front curvature until it gets close to the centre. Eventually, at the centre a break down in the shock front is inevitable. Finally, for the elliptical shock the perturbation parameter ($\xi$) was found to vary with shock travel in a complex manner that cannot be represented by a simple power law. This finding is in good agreement with recent experimental results.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The role of the intergeniculate leaflet in the circadian response to light</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Edelstein, Kim</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Mammalian circadian rhythms are generated and regulated by a pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. Transmission of photic information to the SCN occurs via a direct projection from the retina, the retinohypothalamic tract, and an indirect projection from the retinorecipient intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), the geniculohypothalamic tract. The retinohypothalamic tract is necessary for synchronization of rhythms to environmental light-dark cycles. In contrast, although the IGL is strategically located to convey light information to the SCN, a role for the IGL in photic entrainment has not been established. IGL-lesioned hamsters have been shown to entrain normally to light-dark cycles; effects of the lesion have been manifested in slower rates of re-entrainment to shifts in the light-dark cycle and small changes in the size of light-induced phase shifts. In the present thesis, the relationship between the IGL and the circadian response to light is explored in two sets of experiments. The first three experiments evaluated activation of IGL neurons by light using immunohistochemical expression of Fos protein as a marker of cellular activation. In rodents, light-induced Fos in SCN neurons is phase dependent and is correlated with the effectiveness of such light to phase shift circadian rhythms. Furthermore, because the IGL has been implicated in the effects of nonphotic stimuli on circadian rhythms, the induction of Fos in the SCN and IGL in response to nonphotic manipulations was assessed. Results demonstrate that, in contrast to light-induced Fos in the SCN, light induces Fos protein in the IGL regardless of circadian time, and continues to do so as long as the animal is exposed to light. Moreover, nonphotic manipulations induce Fos in both SCN and IGL. However, in the IGL, Fos expression in response to such treatments was enhanced during the light phase of the light-dark cycle. Pharmacological manipulations that attenuate both light-induced phase shift and Fos expression in the SCN are without effect on light-induced Fos expression in the IGL. The effects of electrolytic lesions of the IGL on circadian temperature rhythms were examined under different lighting schedules in the final two experiments using a telemetry system. Rhythms in these animals were compared to those of intact controls as well as to rhythms of rats with neurotoxic damage to the visual system resulting from neonatal monosodium. glutamate (MSG) treatment. IGL-lesioned rats entrained normally to light-dark cycles consisting of 12 hours of light followed by 12 hours of darkness, and showed the disruption of rhythmicity after prolonged constant light housing seen in intact animals. However, in contrast to intact and MSG-treated rats, IGL-lesioned animals exhibited free-running temperature rhythms under a skeleton photoperiod consisting of one-hour of light exposure at times corresponding to dusk and dawn. Because nocturnal animals normally experience light only around dusk and dawn, the inability to entrain to this ecologically relevant lighting schedule suggests that the IGL plays a critical role in photic entrainment.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Photic entrainment and induction of immediate-early genes within the rat circadian system</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Beaulé, Christian</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Immediate-early genes (IEG) are transiently expressed within the rodent circadian system in response to nocturnal light. Immediate-early genes are part of the mechanism by which light induces phase shifts of circadian rhythmicity. The two most studied light-induced IEG within the rodent circadian system are Fos and Jun-B. Molecular expression of these two genes within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) correlates both in magnitude and in the temporal contingency with light-induced behavioral phase shifts. The determination of the role of Fos and Jun-B in circadian clock resetting was previously attempted using light stimuli that induces strong phase shifts. However, the relationship between light-induced IEG in an entrainment context is undocumented in rats. The present study examined the relation between photic induction of Fos and Jun-B in an entrainment context. Male rats, for which the free running period was determined, were entrained for 14 days on a 0.5h:23.5h LD cycle with light onset at dawn. On the fifteenth day, the entraining light pulse was reduced to 10 minutes and brains were processed for IEG immunocytochemistry. Strong Fos induction was observed in the three brain regions investigated: the SCN, intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and anterior paraventricular thalamus (PVT). Strong Jun-B immunoreactivity was observed only in the SCN. Jun-B labeling was weak in the IGL, and absent in the PVT. Significant correlations were obtained between light-induced IEG in the SCN and the magnitude of the daily phase shift required for entrainment. Further, Fos and Jun-B immunoreactivities correlated in the SCN and in the IGL. These data suggest that the magnitude of Fos and Jun-B induction within the SCN is related to the magnitude of the daily phase shift required for entrainment.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Chargino-neutralino production in pp̄-collisions for the left-right supersymmetric model</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Saif, Harith N</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>An extension of the supersymmetric standard model to the supersymmetric SU(2)$\sb{\rm L}$ x SU(2)$\sb{\rm R}$ x U(1)$\sb{\rm B-L}$ model is considered. The gauge group contains bi-doublet and triplet Higgs fields. In this work we have considered chargino (charged gauginos mixed with higgsinos) and neutralino (neutral gauginos mixed with higgsinos) eigenstates for the left-right supersymmetric (L-R SUSY) model. After mixing, in the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM), there are two charginos and four neutralinos. In the L-R supersymmetric model, in addition to four charginos there are three neutralinos generated from the first symmetry breaking, and four neutralinos generates from the second symmetry breaking. The mixings are in general model dependent. In the minimal SUSY and L-R SUSY models, these mixings can be parameterized in terms of a few parameters. We find analytical expressions and numerical solutions for the mass eigenstates with some restrictions on the L-R parameters. We also investigate the possibility of detecting chargino and neutralino production in pp-collisions at CDF, namely $\rm p\bar{p}\to W\sbsp{L,R}{-} + X\to\ \sbsp{\chi\sb{j}}{\sim\sb-}\sbsp{\chi\sb{i}}{\sim0} + X.$ The expressions for these inclusive cross-sections are solved numerically, using parton model distributions. We have used $\rm \tilde{M}\sb\chi -= 45\ GeV,$ tan$\beta$ = 1 and a lower bound on the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) mass, $\tilde\chi$ = 14 GeV. Finally we take $\rm M\sb{WR}\ge 300$ GeV for $\rm g\simeq g\sb{L}\simeq g\sb{R}.$ In the pp-center of mass frame we find the cross sections are: $\rm \sigma\sb{L}(p\bar{p}\to W\sbsp{L}{-} + X\to\sbsp{\chi\sb{j}}{\sim\sb-}\sbsp{\chi\sb{i}}{\sim0} + X)\approx0.11$ nb, and $\rm \sigma\sb{R}(p\bar{p}\to W\sbsp{R}{-} + X\to\sbsp{\chi\sb{j}}{\sim\sb-}\sbsp{\chi\sb{i}}{\sim0} + X)\approx4.6$ pb, and thus $\rm \sigma\sb{L}\ge24\sigma\sb{R}$ at $\sqrt{\rm s}$ = 1.8 TeV. Cross sections are also given for larger values of the center of mass energy $\sqrt{\rm s}$ up to those available at the SSC. The results are compared with the prompt-lepton background of the $\rm W\sbsp{L,R}{-}$ decays from $\rm p\bar{p}\to W\sbsp{L,R}{-} + X\to\ell\sp-\nu\sb{\ell L,R} + X.$ Both decays for $\rm W\sbsp{L,R}{-}$-bosons show Jacobian peaks for $\rm p\sb{T} = \sqrt{\{s}}/2\simeq M\sb{WL}/2\simeq40$ GeV $\rm (p\sb{T}\simeq 150$ GeV for M$\sb{\rm WR})$ at $\theta=90\sp\circ.$ Furthermore the chargino signature unlike the prompt-lepton background is symmetric under the Jacobian peak. We also exhibit the dependence of the angular distribution of the chargino on the c.m angle $\theta$ for $\rm p\sb{T} = 40$ GeV, 150 GeV at $\sqrt{\rm s} = 1.8$ TeV.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>End depth and flow relationships for smooth open trapezoidal and circular channels</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ahlen, Karl</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The current study's objective was to obtain an accurate relationship between the end depth Y$\sb{\rm e}$ and the discharge rate for smooth open channels with trapezoidal and circular cross sections. To accomplish this, the momentum equation was used. The velocity and pressure head distributions at the end depth Y$\sb{\rm e}$ were determined to obtain the corresponding velocity and pressure coefficients, (alpha $\alpha$, beta $\beta$ and K). The pressure head readings were obtained through the use of a static Pitot tube. Velocity readings were obtained through the use of a Pitot tube and a Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA) system. The velocity measurements with the Pitot tube utilised procedures to take into account the curvilinear nature of the flow in the Y$\sb{\rm e}$ region. The present investigation improves on existing studies in several ways. (1) The velocities over the entire end depth and critical depth sections for circular and trapezoidal cross sectional channels were measured over a range of flow conditions. (2) The pressure distribution at the end depth section for circular and trapezoidal cross sectional channels were measured to incorporate the pressure force term in the momentum analysis. (3) The pressure and velocity coefficients K, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ were evaluated based on the velocity and pressure distribution data. (4) Pressure head values were also calculated indirectly at the end depth section using velocity distribution data for circular and trapezoidal cross sectional channels. Another aspect of the study was the improved analysis of the momentum equation with the calculation of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ coefficients for both circular and trapezoidal channels. The improved analysis of the momentum equation provides for a more accurate functional relationship between the two flow variables. This would permit the establishment of a simple method for monitoring the flow rate in existing channels at their discharge point.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Investigation of Near Wake Flow Structure of a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine Using Particle Image Velocimetry</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Tom, Kevin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>An experimental study was conducted to investigate the mean and turbulent flow characteristics in the near wake region of a model horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), with the rotor diameter D = 0.15 m. State-of-the-art particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique was utilized to measure two dimensional velocity fields in horizontal planes, which extended between 0.15 D upstream to 0.7 D downstream. Measurements were taken at three vertical positions (z = 0.185 m, 0.135 m, and 0.05 m) to account for wake perturbations from the blades, support tower and blades, and the tower itself. The wind speed was varied to give a tip speed ratio (λ) range of 3.5 - 4.25 and chord Reynolds number between 1900 - 2500. A phase averaging algorithm was developed according to the rotor’s angular configuration to compute various phase-averaged flow quantities. Results are presented in ensemble-averaged and phase-averaged forms. Results of phase averaged velocity deficit determined regions of accelerated flow adjacent to individual blades, and a localized region of lower momentum due to flow separation. The correlation between blade-trailing vorticity strength, and the increase in turbulence was confirmed through profiles of turbulence intensity. The profiles of Reynolds stress showed significant enhancement immediately downstream of blades and tower indicating the enhanced production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). The wavenumber spectra of both streamwise and crosswind velocity components were examined. The result provided the first quantitative estimate of the scales at which energy is injected into the turbulence by the blades and tower. An inertial subrange was observed at all heights, and it was determined that the tower redistributed TKE to a wider range of scales.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Treatment of the Impacts of Transport Inflexion Points and Charge Trapping at the Surface States on Drain Current of AlGaN/GaN HFETs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Loghmany, Alireza / AL</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>During the past two decades AlGaN/GaN Heterostructure Field Effect Transistors (HFETs) have been the target of much attention in high power microwave applications. Crystal imperfections in AlGaN/GaN HFETs have been pointed out as the cause of many reliability concerns such as drain-current collapse, gate lag, and excessive gate leakage-current. Current collapse and reliability degradation due to electron trapping at the surface layer of AlGaN/GaN HFETs are major impediments for commercialization of these devices. Even though there have been remarkable improvements in crystal growth and device fabrication technology, trapping effects in AlGaN/GaN HFETs, specially under high drain-voltage conditions, have not been completely removed. Therefore, an assured simulation of HFET with incorporation of trapping effects is needed. In this thesis, in order to substantiate the hypothesis of electron trapping at deep surface states as the cause of semi-permanent current collapse this phenomenon is studied with the use of CADtool Medici. Monte Carlo simulation of electronic transport at AlGaN/GaN channels reveals that in addition to the steady-state velocity overshoot there exists a pronounced kink in the low electric-field region of the drift-velocity versus electric-field characteristics of these channels. Existence of the inflexion points attributed to this kink and the large width of the overshoot pattern in conjunction with the large electric-fields conventionally applied to these wide band-gap semiconductors, make the modeling of electronic devices fabricated in this technology different than those of other III-V semiconductors. An analytical model for drain current/voltage characteristic of AlGaN/GaN HFETs with incorporation of steady-state drift-velocity overshoot and the inflexion points in the electronic drift transport characteristics is also presented in this thesis. The wide peak and pronounced inflexion points in the transport characteristics of AlGaN/GaN heterojunctions are modeled through considering a drift-diffusion channel rather than a drift-only transport channel. Simulation results have been compared to a non-diffusion type channel implemented with the assumption of Ridley’s saturating transport model. The model is based on applying an iterative approach between Poisson’s equation and current-continuity equation, which relieves the results from the burden of the choice of fitting parameters. With the advancement of this technology, development of a versatile analytical model with incorporation of these considerations is vital for understanding the full range of capabilities of III-Nitride material system.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Analytical Modeling of Drain-Current Characteristics of AlGaN/GaN HFETs with Incorporation of the Impacts of Virtual-Gate and Transferred-Electron Effect</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Moradi, Maziar</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>GaN-based heterostructure field effect transistors (HFETs) have gained considerable attention in high-power microwave applications. So far, unsurpassed current levels and high output power at microwave frequencies have been achieved. However, the dominant factors limiting the reliability of these devices under high-power operation are still unsettled. Drain current collapse is one of the major encumbrances in the development of reliable high-power devices in this technology. In this thesis, an accurate and versatile analytical model based on the concept of virtual gate formation due to the existence of acceptor type surface states is developed to model the current-collapse phenomenon. The implementation of this simple and at the same time precise analytical model demonstrates superb agreement with the experimental observations of permanent/semi-permanent current collapse in AlGaN/GaN HFETs. An analytical model, with incorporation of transferred-electron effect, for drain-current characteristics of AlGaN/GaN HFETs is also presented. Oftentimes, the transferred electron effect is neglected in modeling the drain-current characteristics of III-V HFETs. The broader steady-state electron drift-velocity overshoot of GaN in comparison to other direct semiconductors such as GaAs and InP, in addition to the larger difference between the peak and saturation drift-velocity, and the wider bandgap of this semiconductor predict the importance of the incorporation of transferred-electron effect (i.e. steady-state drift-velocity overshoot) in modeling the drain-current of these devices. Simulation results are compared with the results of the adoption of Ridley’s mobility model which does not take into account the transferred-electron effect. Solving the Poisson’s equation through a simple iterative method and considering the diffusion component of current are at the core of this model. The iterative nature of this approach has considerably relieved the outcome of the implementation from the choice of fitting parameters.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Penetration of Circular and Elliptical Liquid Jets into Gaseous Crossflow: A Combined Theoretical and Numerical Study</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Najafi Marzbali, Seyedmohsen</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A combined theoretical and numerical study of liquid jet deformation discharged perpendicularly into a subsonic transverse gas flow is carried out. Near-field trajectory of the jet is determined from an analytical approach for momentum flux ratios up to 100. Force balance on liquid element is analyzed in free stream direction assuming that surface tension and viscous forces are small compared to the aerodynamic force acting on the liquid column. Mass shedding from jet surface and liquid evaporation are neglected; therefore, the jet cross-sectional area and the jet velocity are invariable. A logarithmic correlation for the trajectory of elliptical liquid jets is proposed that takes into account the liquid to gas momentum ratio and drag coefficient. The changes in freestream properties and the gas velocity are incorporated in terms of the drag coefficient. In the numerical part, the drag coefficients of elliptical profiles with various aspect ratios are formulated based on the gas Reynolds number using a two dimensional model. The trajectories of elliptical jets with various aspect ratios are calculated based on the obtained drag coefficients. It is shown that the jets with lower aspect ratios penetrate more into the crossflow. Furthermore, the deformation of a circular liquid jet subject to a gaseous crossflow is simulated using a three dimensional model. Volume of Fluid method is employed to capture the interface between the two phases and the first moment of closure is used to model Reynolds stresses in Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The deformations of the jet cross-section as the jet penetrates into the crossflow are illustrated. It is shown that the model is capable of resolving the Counter-rotating Vortex Pair (CVP) formed downstream of the jet.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Interactive Simulation of Fluid Flow</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Fortin, Michael</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The simulation of fluid flow on rectangular grids using a discretized version of the Navier Stokes Equations for incompressible fluid flow can be simultaneously described as an aesthetically pleasing and computationally intensive embarrassingly parallel problem. Ideally, the aesthetics of the fluid simulation should, given some set of parameters, feel natural despite the synthetic nature of the underlying grids. This natural feel, paramount to the success of the system, should fool a person into believing that they are interacting with a real fluid. The number of calculations and data accesses increases with the number of cells present in the rectangular grid upon which the fluid is simulated. An increased number of calculations are required for augmented accuracy, different external forces, and additional dimensions. Since it is a trivial task to increase the complexity of the simulation, interactivity becomes a challenge of balancing accuracy, stability, and detail against speed of execution. A simple solution is to throw more processing power through increased instruction execution speeds or additional cores. Throwing additional cores at the problem strains the memory bus making it the point that slows down the simulation. Therefore for a given algorithm, respecting data locality and processor peculiarities can be used to minimize execution times. This document introduces a means of caching corrected velocity fields, a task scheduler that attempts to maximize the usage of the cache on multi-core processors, and a na\"ive compression algorithm based on run-length encoding.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An Experimental Investigation of Flow Energy Losses in Open-Channel Expansions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Najafi Nejad Nasser, Azita</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Channel expansions are common in both natural and engineered open channels. They connect a relatively narrow upstream section of channel with a large downstream section of channel. Due to increasing cross-sectional dimensions in an expansion, the flow decelerates. Under steady flow conditions flow deceleration results in an increase in water pressure and hence an adverse pressure gradient. This often triggers flow separation and turbulent eddy motion, and causes energy losses in the flow. When conservation of flow energy is required, the issue of energy losses becomes important, a consideration which has motivated this study. The focus of this study is on subcritical flow, a typical flow seen under a wide range of flow conditions. This study aims to quantify the energy losses in a lateral expansion and to further investigate how effective a hump fitted on the channel-bed of the expansion is at reducing energy losses. This study adopted the experimental approach. Using a recirculating laboratory flume, experiments of flow in expansions with or without a hump were performed to measure flow depth, pressure, and cross-sectional mean velocities. These measurements were analysed using the energy concept for direct estimates of the energy loss coefficient. Without the hump, measured water pressures showed adverse gradient in the expansion, opposing the approaching flow. Estimates of the energy loss coefficients ranged from 0.46 to 0.62. These results would be useful for the design of channel expansions, and for calibrating and validating numerical hydrodynamics models. The presence of the hump has been shown to accelerate the flow, convert adverse to favourable pressure gradient, and lower the energy loss coefficients by more than 50% when compared with the corresponding values without the hump. So far no satisfactory theory has been established for determining the energy loss coefficient for a given expansion. In this study, the momentum concept is combined with the energy concept in order to derive a theoretical expression for the energy loss coefficient. When applying the momentum concept to flow in an expansion, the pressure forces may be evaluated using the hydrostatic approximation, as supported by experimental evidence from this study. The theoretical expression involves extra parameters whose values are obtained based on the experimental data. It has been shown that the theoretical and experimental values for the energy loss coefficient are in good agreement. This theoretical expression can easily be extended to study channel expansions of different configurations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental and numerical study of the characteristics of side weir flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mangarulkar, Kiran</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Side weirs are extensively used in hydraulic engineering, irrigation, and environmental engineering applications which involve flow measurement and regulation. Flows through side weirs are typical examples of spatially varied flow (SVF) with decreasing discharge. The flow emerging out from the side weir is three-dimensional (3D) due to variations in the water surface profile. These flow characteristics can be obtained by experimental methods,numerical modeling or by theoretical analysis. The present study is confined to the rectangular side weir located in a horizontal rectangular channel having zero sill height. Experiments were performed on the rectangular side weir to locate the stagnation zone, the region of separation and the water surface profile. A Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) unit was used to measure the mean and turbulent velocity components of the flow. Experimental results are analyzed to find the detailed flow characteristics using data related to the velocity distribution, velocity vectors, separation streamlines, stagnation point and water surface profiles for different weir flow configurations. The predictions of the 3D numerical turbulence model were validated using the experimental results. The 3D equations, Reynolds’s averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and the twoequation renormalized relations (RNG k-ε) were verified using experimental results. The volume of fluid (VOF) scheme was incorporated in the model to find free surface profiles of the open channel flow configuration denoting the side weir flow. The simulation result provided iv detailed analysis of flow patterns, velocity distributions, water surface profiles, flow separation zone, stagnation zone, and separation streamlines. In general, the experimental data validated the predictions of the numerical model. The location of the stagnation point on the near wall was also determined based on the existing ideal flow analysis of Michell for flow past a rectangular outlet in a 2D conduit and was shown to be close to both test results and model predictions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fin and Island Isolation of AlGaN/GaN HFETs and Temperature-dependent Modeling of Drain Current Characteristics of AlGaN/GaN HFETs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>AlOtaibi, Bandar</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Over the past two decades AlGaN/GaN Heterostructure Field Effect Transistors (HFETs) have been the target of many studies on their suitability for high-power and high-temperature applications. Due to the sizable inherent polarization effects, present in these heterostructure-based devices, the built-in sheet charge density at the AlGaN/GaN heterointerface is remarkably high, which makes these devices fall into the category of the depletion-mode field effect transistors. Despite the suitability of this wide-bandgap material system for switching power applications, the depletion-mode character of these HFETs has been acting as an obstacle against the adoption of AlGaN/GaN HFETs to these applications. As a result, a vibrant research on the development of techniques capable of reliably changing the depletion-mode character of AlGaN/GaN HFETs into an enhancement-mode character is currently being pursued by many investigators. Towards this end, the proposed approach of this thesis has been based on modifying the piezoelectric component of the polarization sheet charge density through studying its correlation with the size of the isolation mesa. The impact of the size of the isolation-mesa on the sweeping- and pulsed-mode drain current-voltage characteristics of AlGaN/GaN HFETs has been studied. Investigations reveal that while by implementing AlGaN/GaN HFETs on array of islands or mesas of smaller dimensions, rather than one continuous-mesa, same values for the maximum drain current level can be maintained, pinch-off voltage can be made less negative. Also, it is shown that the maximum gate transconductance is improved by island-type isolation. In addition, it is shown that the proportionally larger surface area available for power dissipation in fin- and island-isolated HFETs can reduce the impact of self-heating on AlGaN/GaN HFETs. Modeling the drain current of AlGaN/GaN HFETs at high-temperature ambient was also another objective of this thesis. A Monte Carlo-based temperature-dependent mobility model, with incorporation of steady-state velocity overshoot, is employed in modeling the drain current-voltage characteristics of AlGaN/GaN HFETs at 300, 400, and 500K. One of the major merits of this model is that it employs a very small set of fitting parameters. The model takes into account the temperature-dependence of the electron transport through the gated-channel of an AlGaN/GaN HFET and also its access regions. This model is validated with regards to the experimentally measured drain current characteristics. Results confirm that the temperature dependency of the drift electron velocity is the cause of the degradation of drain current at elevated temperatures.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The flow development in jet-driven vortex chambers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Jawarneh, Ali</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This work presents the study of the flow in a jet-driven vortex chamber over a wide range of Reynolds numbers, contraction ratios, inlet angles, area and aspect ratios. Dimensional analysis furnishes the general functional relationships between the fundamental dimensionless quantities. Application of the integral equations of continuity and energy over the control volume, along with the minimum-pressure-drop or maximum flow rate postulate, provide the required analytical means to relate the predominant non-dimensional parameters such as the chamber geometry, the core size, pressure drop, Reynolds number, and viscous losses. Both the n = 2 vortex model, with reverse and non-reverse flow, and the free vortex model have been used at the vortex chamber exit plane. The theoretical results are found to successfully capture most of the salient properties of the flow. The influence of vortex chamber geometry, such as contraction ratio, inlet angle, area ratio, aspect ratio, and Reynolds number, on the flow field has been analyzed and compared with the present experimental data. A parametric study explores how the pressure coefficient and the core size vary with the different dimensionless properties. The observations show the pressure drop to decrease with the length. At first this appears to be counterintuitive since one habitually expects the pressure drop to be larger for longer pipes. A closer examination however, reveals that in addition to the radial-axial plane flow there is also a substantial centrifugal force, which decays with the length, thus shaping the development of the overall flow-field. The pressure drop across the vortex chamber differs from that in pipe flow, due to the mechanism of swirl flow. It depends mainly on intensity of tangential velocity. If the chamber length is increased, the vortex decay factor decreases, which leads to less pressure drop. The current theory confirms that the previous published models are only applicable for high Reynolds numbers where the inertia dominates the viscous forces. Based on the present theory, a new approach to determine the tangential velocity and radial pressure profiles inside the vortex chamber is developed and compared with the available experimental data. The n = 2 vortex model with reverse flow gives better results for strongly swirling flow.</dc:description>

The first part is devoted to the Krall-Sheffer theory of two-dimensional classical orthogonal polynomials. This problem is deeply connected with the classification of second order linear differential operators in 2D having polynomial eigenvectors with certain degeneracies of eigenvalues. The original classification problem is related to the theory of symplectic reductions of Hamiltonian systems. Using the R-matrix theory on loop algebras, the reduction scheme sheds new light on the superintegrability of Krall-Sheffer operators. It is also used to deduce explicit results on separation of coordinates and commuting invariants in both the classical and quantum settings. In the second part of the thesis we study Poisson structures on spaces of rational maps. Such spaces have natural Poisson structures discovered by Atiyah and Hitchin. The approach developed here relates those to the classical R -matrix scheme and further generalizes the Atiyah-Hitchin construction to spaces of meromorphic functions in different geometries using the quadratic r-matrix construction of Sklyanin. More precisely, any classical R -matrix may be viewed as a special linear automorphism of a Lie algebra. In the Sklyanin theory, the r-matrix defines simultaneously a quadratic Poisson structure on a Poisson-Lie group and a linear one on the corresponding dual space to the Lie algebra. The quadratic structures appeared first as Poisson brackets between elements of the scattering matrix in the case of rapidly decreasing boundary conditions. The Atiyah-Hitchin structure is also defined as brackets on a space of scattering matrices for solutions of Bogomolny equations governing interactions of monopoles in nonabehan gauge theories. Using this analogy, we obtain the desired generalizations. The third project relates to the problem of Laplacian Growth (LG) in two-dimensional viscous fluid dynamics. It describes the dynamics of the boundaries in various processes (e.g. propagation of oil-water interfaces, crystal growth etc), and is of great practical importance. Recently established connections with integrable systems has brought the problem into the domain of modern mathematical physics. In this thesis, the Hamiltonian nature of rational conformal maps describing so-called "multi-finger" solutions of the LG problem is investigated. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Computation and visualization of periodic orbits in the circular restricted three-body problem</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhang, Chenghai</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, the continuation and bifurcation software AUTO is used to compute periodic solutions of the circular restricted Three-Body problem (CR3BP). Periodic solution families for the Sun-Earth, the Earth-Moon, and the Sun-Jupiter system are studied in detail. Bifurcation diagrams for these systems are presented. Corresponding periodic orbits are also shown. To understand the solution structure better, a new data visualization package, PLAUT04, has been developed for AUTO. It reads AUTO data files and creates solution diagrams and bifurcation diagrams. This new package can also be used to animate solutions. A special version of PLAUT04, called PLAUT04/r3b, has been developed for the CR3BP. Using PLAUT04/r3b, we can animate solutions both in a rotating frame and in an inertial frame. These new graphics packages for AUTO have good rendering speed, flexibility, and display quality. A user-friendly interface makes both easy to learn and use.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Design and fabrication of new types of micro optical components</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhang, Lijun</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Some novel micro planar optical components (MPOC) and a micro wire grid polarizer are designed and fabricated. As one of the application of MPOC, a device for color recognition is designed and fabricated. Characteristics of mediums like light, silicon dioxide, silicon and polysilicon as well as their interactions with light are discussed. Making use of the theory of optical physics and geometrical optics, the principle of light path control components and the properties of light energy transmission are analyzed. Power loss of MPOC is simulated by specific optics software. Micro wire grid polarizer is designed and fabricated using MUMP technologies with the support of Canadian Microelectronic Corporation (CMC). Different from traditional optical components fabrication process, the fabrication process coming from chip fabrication technology is applied for the first time for making MPOC. Fabrication of MPOC is conducted in micro-fabrication laboratories at Concordia. All devices are fabricated in micron scales and are compatible with optical fibre light coupling. The processes employed here for fabrication of the micro optical components can greatly reduce the components dimensions and decrease the production cost by a mass production supported by the process.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A tight two-way fluid-structure coupling for aeroelastic computations in the time domain</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Lepage, Claude</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A three-dimensional implicit finite element Euler/Navier-Stokes solver based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation has been developed for fluid-structure interactions, moving and deforming bodies, and aeroelastic calculations. The flow solver is complemented by a built-in moving grid algorithm which allows the computational grid for the fluid to move simultaneously with the moving body, without the need for global mesh regeneration and solution interpolation. The flow solver is coupled to a stress solver in a tight fashion at each time step, although both solvers exist independently and are used as black boxes. The aerodynamic loads and the structural displacements are transferred between the two solvers in a conservative fashion using the concept of a virtual grid, which guarantees the conservative transfer of both the pressure and the viscous shear stresses and also lends itself to complex geometries featuring non-matching grids at the fluid-solid interface. The level of tightness of the coupling on the aeroelastic response is investigated and the efficiency and accuracy of different solution strategies are discussed. The technology has been validated on well documented aeroelastic configurations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Performance of distributed fiber Raman amplifiers with incoherent pumps</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zhang, Ting</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In 2003, Ahura Company first introduced the high-power incoherent Raman pump, and illustrated the basic property of this pumping is to provide flat gain. After that, no paper relate to incoherent pumping has been published. In this thesis, distributed fiber Raman amplifiers (DFRAs) with incoherent pumping are investigated and the DFRAs performances are compared to those with the conventional coherent pumping for the first time. To achieve accurate modeling, a theoretical model, which includes effects of multiple-path interference (MPI), anti-Stokes, and Rayleigh scattering, is used, and a new Raman gain coefficient scaling method is employed in modeling. Theoretical modeling of incoherent pump is also given. First of all, these models are verified and proved to be accurate. Investigations are based on the above models for DFRAs with one or more incoherent pumps. By comparing the performance between the two types of DFRAs, we confirmed that DFRAs with incoherent pumping can have a much flatter gain than those with coherent pumping, and made the following contributions: (1) The gain ripple, the most important factor in the design of DFRAs, is reduced exponentially in dB with the increase of spectral width of incoherent pumps; while the average Raman gain, for the same pump power as coherent pumping, decreases linearly in dB and noise performance is degraded slightly due to the reduction of the Raman gain. (2) Keeping the spectral width un-changed and increasing the incoherent pump power improves the average Raman gain and noise performance, but noise is still slightly worse than coherent pumping for the same Raman gain level. (3) When multiple pumping is used, the number of pumping wavelengths is reduced significantly for the same gain ripple if incoherent pumping replaces coherent pumping.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The effects of vortex profile on sound generation and propagation in non-uniform flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Zheng, Tinghui</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This study was motivated by airframe noise in aircraft and blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise in helicopters. In this thesis, the sound generated by vortical disturbances in a subsonic flow around solid surfaces, using different vortex velocity formulations, was investigated by numerically solving the linearized or non-linearized Euler equations. Analytical solutions for this general case are not available because the wavelength of the generated acoustic wave is comparable to the vortex size, which is at variance to the compact source assumption of the acoustic analogy. Numerical errors associated with the discretization and boundary conditions were kept small using a high-order scheme with accurate non-reflecting boundary conditions. Stagnation flow on a flat plate, flow around a stationary and rotating cylinder, and that about two cylinders were taken as prototypes of real-world flows with strong gradients of mean pressure and velocity. Single and periodic vortices were taken into consideration. In addition, the effect of vortex core size, the street distance, street frequency, and the Mach number of the mean flow on sound generation and propagation were examined. The sound wave strength was found to be proportional to the vortex strength. If the acoustic pressure is normalized by the vortex strength, then all the distinct acoustic pressure profiles will collapse into single curve. Sound generation by vortex interaction with a solid surface, as well as its propagation, were found to be totally different between the Taylor's and Vatistas's vortices. The vortex core size and vortex street distance have minor influences on the acoustic pressure profile for sound waves radiated by the Vatistas vortex. Nevertheless, the change of the core size or the distance between the vortex rows significantly affects the sound pressure profile and sound directivity radiated by a Taylor vortex. The effects of the non-linear terms on sound wave properties were also investigated. The non-linear influence was found to increase with the vortex strength. A lifting cylinder is shown not only to increase the sound wave amplitude, but also to shift its directivity. The developed methods and computer codes can be used in the future as platforms to more elaborate methods that will predict the noise generated by multi-element airfoils, and the undercarriage of an aircraft. This will help reduce the need of costly, time consuming, wind tunnel and field experiments.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Scattering of electromagnetic waves by two parallel chiral circular cylinders</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Rahman, Shafiqur</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The electromagnetic scattering from two parallel chiral circular cylinders is analyzed using a boundary value problem approach. Both cylinders are assumed to be illuminated by either a transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) wave. The separation of variable technique and proper transformation theorems are used to formulate the solution. The incident fields, scattered fields, and transmitted fields are expanded in terms of the cylindrical vector wave functions. Drude-Born-Fedorov (DBF) constitutive relations and Bohren decomposition formula are used to express the electromagnetic fields inside the chiral cylinders. The boundary conditions are imposed in conjunction with the addition theorem of the Hankel function on the boundary surface of each cylinder. The boundary conditions yield a system of linear equations for each type of polarization which can be numerically solved to obtain the unknown expansion coefficients by a proper truncation of the infinite sums into finite sums. Numerical results are given to show the effects on co- and cross-polarized echo widths for some selected parameters and geometries. The effects on the back and forward scattering co- and cross-polarized echo widths are also given with respect to the separation distance between two cylinders and angle of incidence. From the numerical results, it can be evident that chirality parameter plays an important role controlling the echo width. The validity and accuracy of the results are compared with available published results for special and limiting cases. Several numerical results are also given for the scattering of electromagnetic waves by single chiral cylinder for both the TM and TE cases and validated with existing published results.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>We investigated high speed optical fiber communication systems using optical s-DPSK, s/2-DPSK, DQPSK and Offset-DQPSK modulation techniques, focusing on the system modeling and comparison of performance. The electronic precoder of optical s/2-DPSK was yet unknown, and its logic and basic circuit are presented in this thesis. We also compared the system performance with the impact of inter symbol interference (ISI) caused by fiber nonlinear effect, narrowband inline optical filtering and residual chromatic dispersion. It is shown that DQPSK has the narrowest signal bandwidth among four phase modulation schemes; Offset-DQPSK has two main lobes in its optical spectrum; Offset-DQPSK has the best tolerance to ISI induced by fiber nonlinear effect; s-DPSK has the best tolerance to optical filtering; and DQPSK has the best tolerance to residual chromatic dispersion. s-DPSK has better tolerance to residual chromatic dispersion than s/2-DPSK. All of these works were verified on Optism, a commercial optical simulation software platform</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Design sensitivity analyses of two-dimentional recursive band-pass and band-stop digital filters with an application in image processing</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sundaram, Karthikeyan Keelapandal</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Two-dimensional variable recursive digital Band-pass and Band-stop filters are applied in signal processing and pro-imagining process, as well as communication systems where the frequency domain characteristics of digital filters are required to be adjustable. The main objective of this thesis has been to propose a new method of designing 2-D recursive Band-Pass and Band-Stop digital filters with variable characteristics. From the identical analog 1-D second order Butterworth Low-Pass analog ladder network, 2-D Band-Pass and Band-Stop digital filters can be obtained through the application of Low-Pass to Band-Pass/Band-Stop transformation and double generalized bilinear transformations. The denominators of these filters transfer functions are verified for VSHP. Sensitivity analyses are performed by varying the coefficients of the double generalized bilinear transformation such as k 1 , k 2 , a 1 , a 2 , b 1 and b 2 with respect to center frequency '} o ' and Bandwidth 'B' on the resulted 2-D Band-Pass and Band-Stop filter, which are obtained by varying the coefficients of the double generalized bilinear transformation in the specific ranges in order to maintain the stability of the filter of the Band-Pass and Band-Stop transfer function respectively.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Fault recovery using discrete event models</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Saboori, Anooshiravan</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, we study the synthesis of fault recovery procedures using discrete-event models. It is assumed that the faults are permanent and that a diagnosis system is available that detects and isolates the faults with a bounded delay. Thus, the combination of the plant and the diagnosis system, as the system to be controlled, will have three modes: normal, transient and recovery. Initially, the plant and thus the system to be controlled, are in the normal mode. Once a fault occurs in the plant, the system (to be controlled) enters the transient mode. After the fault is diagnosed by the diagnosis system, the system enters the recovery mode. We study the design of a nonblocking supervisor that enforces the specifications of the system in all three modes. The solution is obtained by first transforming the problem to an equivalent Robust Nonblocking Supervisory Control Problem under Partial Observation (RNSC-PO) and then solving the robust control problem.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical and experimental investigation of building-integrated photovoltaic-thermal systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Liao, Liang</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents a numerical and experimental study of a building-integrated photovoltaic-thermal (BIPV/T) system in Concordia University, which generates both electricity and thermal energy. A 2-D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed to study the air dynamics and thermal behavior inside the BIPV thermal system and develop relationships for convective heat transfer coefficients. A 2-D k-ε turbulent model is used in the FLUENT program to simulate the turbulent flow and convective heat transfer in the cavity, in addition to the buoyancy effect. Longwave radiation between boundary surfaces is also modeled. Experimental measurements taken in a full scale outdoor test facility at Concordia University are in good agreement with the 2-D CFD model. Velocity and temperature profiles for various average air velocities are predicted and compared with experimental data. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is employed to investigate the velocity profile. Average and local convective heat transfer coefficients are generated for the system</dc:description>

          <dc:title>3D finite difference time domain method for anisotropic materials : theory and application</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Dou, Lixing</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>A 3-D FDTD method for full anisotropic medium was formulated and examined. Contrary to other methods, this approach is separated into two parts: dielectric properties parts and wave marching parts. Dielectric anisotropic properties are realized through the relationships of electric properties---electric flux versus electric field and magnetic properties---magnetic flux versus magnetic field. EM wave marching is realized through the relationships of magnetic field versus electric flux and electric field versus magnetic flux. For the reason that medium properties are expressed separately, this method can avoid major modifications of core updating equations if the studied medium properties change. This can reduces the time necessary for making new FDTD programs for mediums with other properties. This is the reason that this method can also be extended to dispersive, anisotropic &amp; dispersive mediums. A simplified perfect matched layer (PML) was modified and used as the absorbing boundary condition to match anisotropic medium.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hybrid modelling and simulation of rigid bodies in contact</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Pedrami, Reza</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Rigid body systems may undergo numerous types of dynamic interactions including collisions and continuous contact which considerably complicate systematic modelling and simulation of such problems. This thesis introduces a new modelling approach based on a hybrid system formulation to describe the dynamics of interacting rigid body systems. Interaction among physical objects occurs in two different forms: impulsive contact and continuous contact. Characteristics of impulsive and continuous contacts are different. Hence the modelling of each contact type requires the use of different approaches. While the impulse-modelling approach better simulates the impulsive contacts, our findings indicate that continues contact is much more accurately modeled using the sliding manifold method. The proposed hybrid system approach combines the impulse modelling method for collision interactions and the sliding manifold method to model the differential-algebraic equations associated with continuous contact interactions. Appropriate discrete states, events, reset maps, and threshold parameters that yield a hybrid automaton framework to describe interacting rigid body systems are developed. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method a rolling ball simulation for a virtual reality system is presented.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Transverse magnetic wave scattering by elliptic chiral cylinder</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Najjar-Khatirkolaei, Biglar</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The electromagnetic scattering problem of normal incident waves on an elliptic chiral cylinder is considered. The cylinder is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic and extends infinitely long in the z direction. An exact boundary value solution for the scattering problem of the TM wave by the elliptic chiral cylinder is analyzed and presented. The solution is based on the separation of variable technique in the elliptic cylinder coordinates system, and expressed in terms of Mathieu and modified Mathieu functions. The incident, transmitted and scattered electromagnetic waves are expressed in terms of an infinite series of wave functions. The matrix forms of the expansion coefficients are found by applying the boundary conditions and orthogonality of the Mathieu functions. The expression of the radar cross section (RCS) per unit length or echo width of electromagnetic wave scattering by elliptic chiral cylinder for co- and cross-polarized waves are derived by using the asymptotic expansions for modified Mathieu functions. Validation of the developed formulation and computer program are investigated by considering many limiting cases such as circular dielectric, circular perfect conducting, and circular chiral cylinders, as well as elliptic dielectric and elliptic perfect conducting cylinders. Numerical results of the forward and back scattered echo widths for both co- and cross-polarized waves for various cases are presented and discussed. The numerical results show the co- and cross-polarized bistatic and monostatic echo widths depend on the frequency and incidence angle of the incident wave, constitutive parameters and geometry of the elliptic chiral cylinder. In general, the echo widths decrease by increasing the chirality admittance, and increase by increasing the axes of the elliptic chiral cylinder.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Three-dimensional turbulence modeling for free surface flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Qu, Junying</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In engineering practice, some of the hydraulic structures encountered are used for distribution or collection of flows, measurement of flow rates or regulation of flows. It is very important to know the flow characteristics such as the mean flow pattern, the velocity distributions, and the pressure distribution in closed conduits or the water surface profiles in open channels. These flow characteristics can be obtained using experimental methods, exact theoretical methods or numerical methods. Existing commercial codes have some limitations. For instance, the memory requirements and execution time are often excessive for solving hydraulic engineering problems. The boundary conditions to be used are rigidly specified in the software. The CFD software is also very expensive. It is beneficial to develop and validate a new numerical model that can speedily solve the specific problems in hydraulic engineering as mentioned earlier. The present study develops and validates an efficient and accurate numerical turbulence model to simulate common hydraulic problems. The three-dimensional governing equations include the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and the two-equation turbulence models such as the k-} model and the k-ε model. The Volume of fluid (VOF) scheme is also incorporated to capture the free surface profiles in open channel flows. For solving typical problems, the model developed presently needs much shorter execution time and requires less memory than the commercial code. For instance, to simulate open channel junction flows, the general-purpose commercial code (FLUENT) program required 30 days on the PC to reach the solution. The present model required about 4 days of execution time to solve the same problem. To begin with, dividing and combining flows in rectangular closed conduits are simulated, as these flows are simpler than their counterparts in open channel flows. These simulations are later extended to two and three-dimensional flows that have free surfaces. The simulation results provide pressure distributions in closed conduits and water surface profiles in open channels besides velocity distributions and flow patterns. The results also yield zones of flow separations in expanding flows and stagnation zones in dividing and combining flows. The predictions of the simulations are validated using existing test data. Especially, for three-dimensional dividing flows in open channels, new test data are also obtained for the present model validation. For the lateral weir flows, the nonlinear partial least square method is used to obtain the functional relationship among the principle weir flow parameters.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Embedded supervisory control of discrete-event systems</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yang, Yue</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this work we propose to implement supervisory control by embedding control in the plant Finite State Machine (FSM). Supervisory control is introduced by extending the plant with boolean variables, guard formulas and updating functions. Boolean variables are used to encode the supervisor's states. Event observation is captured by a set of boolean functions that update the values of boolean variables, and control is introduced by guarding events with boolean formulas. The resulting Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) implements the supervisory control map in the sense that the languages closed and marked by the EFSM are equal to those of the supervised system. After studying embedded supervisory control under partial observation, centralized and decentralized control architectures are analyzed. It is shown that the coobservability condition remains necessary and sufficient for the existence of decentralized supervisors. An application of our approach in the synthesis of communication protocols is presented.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Wing tip vortex dependence with angle of attack</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>May, David</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This study examines Wing Tip Vortex flows, in the Near to Far Field. A Viscous Incompressible simulation of the NACA 0012 (with an aspect ratio of 6, operating at a free stream Reynolds number of 6.84 e 5) was made. The Tip vortex parameters are compared with available, current, experimental data. Once the validity of the model is assessed, the fluid structures and dynamical processes are described, with the aid of solution visualizations. Characteristics of the flow that have not been studied in open literature are presented. An analysis is conducted regarding the dependence of the Tip Vortex characteristics and their variation with Angle of Attack. Aspects of the, low wing loading, analysis of Moore and Saffman are summarized and assumed to apply in the Far Field Regime. Then, dimensional analysis is used to present reasonable arguments for the scaling of the observed Near Field data. A balance of these two scaling laws is made and is shown to apply in what will be called the Intermediate Field Regime, where dependence with various vortex characteristics display a logarithmic variation with Angle of Attack</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Impact of nonlinear distortion in radio over fiber systems with single-side band and tandem single-side band subcarrier modulations /cCaiqin Wu.</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wu, Caiqin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In radio over fiber (RoF) systems there are two popular optical subcarrier modulations (SCMs) which are single side band (SSB) modulation and tandem single side band (TSSB) modulation. In TSSB modulation one optical carrier carries half of radio frequency (RF) signal tones to lower sideband (LSB) and the reminder to upper sideband (USB); while in SSB modulation all multiple RF signal tones in either LSB or USB. We analyze the impact of nonlinear distortion considering one wavelength carrying two RF signals. For small modulation depth TSSB and SSB SCMs lead to similar and very small nonlinear distortion. Because harmonic distortions (HDs) and inter-modulation distortion (IMDs) are strongly dependent on modulation depth, TSSB and SSB SCMs lead to different nonlinear distortion if modulation depth is not small, depending on two RF difference. To reduce nonlinear distortion for high modulation depth the two RF difference of 1GHz is preferred for both TSSB and SSB SCMs because some nonlinear distortions are dependent on the difference and sum of the two RFs and transmission fiber. However for the larger RF difference, either small modulation depth or medium modulation depth combined with minimum RF of 6GHz has to be used. Comparison of TSSB and SSB SCMs in DWDM RoF systems with 12.5GHz channel spacing and two subcarriers uniformly distributed in the optical spectrum shows that better performance is obtained using SSB SCM when small modulation depth is used. On the contrary, TSSB SCM is better than SSB SCM when large modulation depth is used.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Finite element splitting methods applied to incompressible navier-stokes flow solvers and introduction to mixed mass method</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Balage, Sudantha</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Splitting Methods are considered to be a strong candidate for obtaining accurate, robust and computationally efficient incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) solvers based on Finite Element Method. The type of spatial errors such as the numerical boundary layer observed on pressure solution near walls is known to affect the stability of NS solvers. The inclusion of stabilization terms such as upwinding or artificial viscosity terms would adversely affect the accuracy of the solver. NS solvers based on LBB compliant elements, such as Taylor Hood (TH) elements do not require stabilization terms to simulate higher Reynolds number flow provided their robustness is not affected by above mentioned type of error. This motivates the study of Splitting Methods based on Taylor Hood elements with the emphasis on how well they handle numerical boundary layer type errors to obtain highly accurate NS flow solvers. The effect of the enrichment of the TH elements with pressure bubble nodes is also investigated. The present work brings several well-known Splitting Methods under a common theoretical framework and classifies them appropriate to the study.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Aerodynamic inverse design of turbomachinery blading in two-dimensional viscous flow</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Daneshkhah, Kasra</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>An inverse blade design method, applicable to 2D and 3D flow in turbomachinery blading is developed and is implemented for the design of 2D cascades in compressible viscous flow. The prescribed design quantities are either the pressure distributions on the blade suction and pressure surfaces or the blade pressure loading and its thickness distribution. The design scheme is based on a wall movement approach where the blade walls are modified based on a virtual velocity distribution that would make the current and target momentum fluxes balance on the blade suction and pressure surfaces. The virtual velocity is used to drive the blade geometry towards a steady state shape corresponding to the prescribed quantities. The design method is implemented in a consistent manner into the unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, where an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is used and the boundaries of the computational domain can move and deform in any prescribed time-varying fashion to accommodate the blade movement. A cell vertex finite volume method is used for discretizing the governing equations in space and, at each physical time level, integration in pseudotime is performed using an explicit Runge-Kutta scheme, where local time stepping and residual smoothing are used for convergence acceleration. For design calculations, which are inherently unsteady due to blade movement, the time accuracy of the solution is achieved by means of a dual time stepping scheme. An algebraic Baldwin-Lomax model is used for turbulence closure. The flow analysis method is applied to several test cases for steady state internal flow in linear cascades and the results are compared to numerical and experimental data available in the literature. The inverse design method is first validated for three different configurations, namely a parabolic cascade, a subsonic compressor cascade and a transonic impulse turbine cascade, where different choices of the prescribed design variables are used. The usefulness, robustness, accuracy, and flexibility of this inverse method are then demonstrated on the design of an ONERA transonic compressor cascade, a NACA transonic compressor cascade, a highly cambered DFVLR subsonic turbine cascade, and a VKI transonic turbine cascade geometries, which are typical of gas turbine blades used in modern gas turbine engines</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Accurate drag prediction for transitional external flow over airfoils</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Basha, Wassim</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>When analyzing the flow over airfoils at relatively low Reynolds numbers, transition from laminar to turbulent flow plays an important role in shaping the flow features and in quantifying the airfoil performance such as lift and drag. In most cases, laminar separation bubbles and transition zones that extend over a relatively long portion of the airfoils surface are present. Hence the proper modeling of transition, including both the onset and extent of the transition region, will lead to a more accurate drag prediction. The onset of transition is related to the disturbances that propagate in the laminar flow region. Analyzing such instabilities is carried out either by a full study of the Tollmien-Schlichting waves or by the use of empirical correlations most of which are based on results for two-dimensional incompressible flows. As for the transition extent modeling, different intermittency functions of the linear, algebraic or differential type have been developed. The current work presents a transition model that combines existing methods for predicting the onset and extent of the transition region. The transition onset is predicted using Cebeci and Smith's correlation which is based on Michel's method for incompressible two-dimensional flow while the extent of transition is quantified by developing a linear model for the intermittency function. The proposed transition model is implemented into the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model available in the commercial software, Fluent, using user defined functions (UDF). It is then used in simulating transitional flow in different well documented experimental cases including single-element and two-element airfoils under different free-stream conditions. Given the experimental data, the results obtained with the developed transition model reflect a consistent and significant improvement in drag prediction, when compared with the drag predicted using a fully turbulent flow simulation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Mode matching technique for calculating the dispersion curve of one-dimensional periodic structures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mohebbi, Hamid Reza</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, the rigorous Mode Matching (MM) technique is utilized to find the dispersion curve of the traveling wave in one-dimensional planar periodic structures. The structure consists of a homogenous dielectric substrate backed by a ground plane and infinite number of periodic perfect strip conductors on the top. The thickness of the strips is infinitely small. Such a structure is also known as Strip Grating in frequency selective surface (FSS) applications. The technique is first applied to a shielded microstrip line, and then to the 1-D printed periodic structure. A general formulation for rigorous modeling of shielded microstrip line as well as strip grating structures is introduced. The modeling is based on hybrid transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) mode analysis. After matching the fields at the junction of the air-dielectric, a set of equations on the area of interface is driven. Unlike the conventional MM technique, a simple sub-domain orthogonal set is used to convert the algebraic equations obtained from the boundary conditions into a matrix format.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Multi contrast, multi illumination and microwave imaging of 2D inhomogeneous scatterers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hossain, Md. Mosharroff</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis, we consider the microwave imaging for reconstructing the material properties of inhomogeneous lossy dielectric cylinders using scattered field data. The scattered field is numerically computed using direct/forward method. The scatterer is an inhomogeneous two-dimensional (2D) arbitrary-shaped cylindrical structure containing impurities at any transverse location. The scatterer is immersed in a known dielectric media (like air, water, saline-water etc). The known surrounding dielectric is used as an observation domain whereas the complex scatterer is used as an investigation domain. Unrelated multi sources are used to illuminate the scatterer at different angles for reconstructing the less erroneous complex permittivity profile. Multi-frequency effect with the noise is addressed during the reconstruction of the complex permittivity profile using numerical simulations. The objective function as well as the permittivity profile are computed using an inverse scattering method from the corresponding scattered field. The two-dimensional "Lippmann-Schwinger" integral equation for nonlinear inverse-scattering problem is discretized by the method of moment (MoM)</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical investigation of the unsteady aerodynamics of blade tip leakage flow inside gas turbine engines</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Phutthavong, Patricia</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In today's modern gas turbine engines, the region between the rotor and the stationary shroud has the most extreme fluid-thermal conditions in the entire turbine, and is characterized by a periodically unsteady three-dimensional flow field. Due to the pressure difference across the blade tip, leakage flow enters the gap region from the pressure side and exits from the suction side. Tip leakage flow consists of hot mainstream gas and is highly undesirable since it does not turn, and so does not produce any work. Also, high heat transfer rates in the tip gap region occur as a result of leakage flow due to the formation of very thin boundary layers, which may lead to over-heating of the stationary shrouds. The purpose of the present work is to conduct an unsteady study of the tip leakage flow adjacent to the shroud in real gas turbine engines using an in-house industrial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. A turbine stage consisting of the nozzle guide vane (NGV) and rotor was modeled. The effect of tip clearance height, inlet turbulence intensity, inlet total temperature, and rotor angular velocity on the tip leakage aerodynamics will be investigated. To the best of the author's knowledge, time-accurate simulations have not been performed in order to study the effects of flow parameters on tip leakage flow aerodynamics. In addition, the trials of using a commercial CFD package to obtain heat transfer calculations on the shroud will be presented. It was found that the size of the separation bubble on the pressure side of the blade tip is dependent on the inlet total temperature and rotor angular velocity. Also, when the relative height of the separation bubble is large, a small re-circulation zone was found at the suction side of the blade tip. In all cases, flow re-circulation was found near the trailing edge and was due to the combined effect of the shroud relative motion with the secondary cross-flow from the adjacent blade passage</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Simulation of a 2D pn junction in silicon thin film incorporating quantum transport for carriers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Al Imam, Shahriar</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Silicon nanostructures have recently been a subject of interest demonstrating optimistic optical properties like luminescence. The scientific community predicts quantum effects to be the predominant cause for such optical properties of silicon nanostructures, hence it becomes prudent to pursue the roots of such reduced dimensional devices. With this view as a motive, a simulation model for a 2D thin film quantum confined 2D pn junction in silicon is developed in this work. A thin film silicon layer is considered in the regime of strong confinement. A pn junction in such a film is considered so that the carriers are confined in thickness dimension while they are quantum mechanically transported along the device length. The transverse dimension in considered infinitely wide for plane wave approximation. For device simulation, after a careful study of various schemes to incorporate quantum effects (Van Dort model, Density Gradient Method, etc.) it was decided to use the more rigorous self-consistent Schrödinger-Poisson method. Keeping in mind the computational resource constraints, for problem formulation, decoupled 1D set of equations for carrier transport is deployed. For electrons, the well known single-band effective mass Hamiltonian is used while for holes, multi-band effective mass Hamiltonian with light and heavy holes is applied (though a full 6 band k.p Hamiltonian and spin orbit interaction is required to account for a full featured valence band, no effective work has been done to use such a formulation for a reduced dimensional device). Overall discretization is done using the finite element method with matrix representation of equations. The ohmic contacts in longitudinal direction are simulated with semi infinite open boundary contacts through self energy matrix, and broadening of energy states is incorporated. The simulation is done in Matlab as it gives the highest flexibility (in comparison to Silvaco, Femlab and C++ with the latter being unrealistically involved in numerical solution algorithm). For solution, instead of Wigner function or Green's function, a more direct wave-function perspective is taken. First the equilibrium condition was simulated, and then extension under externally applied voltage was carried out. As the results show, confinement of carrier in lateral dimension results in energy quantization, and consequently subbands. As the material is degenerately doped, the number of carrier is comparable to existing states and carriers exist in excited states also. The occupancy of only three subbands upholds the earlier assumption that only a few subband are occupied. And along with the retention of subband shapes along device length, validates decoupling of the dimensions. The depletion region width is found to be more than that predicted by 3D junction equations. This may be due to the fact that the thin film cannot fully screen the electric field. Current voltage characteristics also do not show any significant tunneling current</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A study of force-motion and vibration transmission properties of seated body under vertical vibration and effects of sitting posture</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Wang, Wenping</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This dissertation research concerns with characterization of the biodynamic responses of seated human body to vibration in terms of force-motion and vibration transmission properties. The force-motion biodynamic responses were measured considering the primary driving-point (seat-buttock interface) using 13 male and 14 female subjects under different postural and excitation conditions. The force-motion data were also analyzed to derive the power absorbed within the vibration-exposed body, apart from the apparent mass (APMS). The measured data are interpreted to demonstrate the significant effects of sitting postures, involving variations in backrest support, hands position and seat geometry, on the biodynamic responses. The results revealed most significant effect of the body mass. The results attained from ANCOVA further show that the primary resonant frequency and bandwidth of the biodynamic responses are strongly influenced by the combined effects of hands position and back support condition, while the peak magnitude is further affected by the seat height. Owing to the limitations of the single-driving point force-motion relationships, experiments were undertaken to measure both the force-motion and transmission of seat vibration to the head simultaneously. A secondary driving-point, formed by the backrest and upper body, is also incorporated for fully characterizing the force-motion biodynamics of the body seated with a back support. An adjustable head-strap comprising a three-axes acceleration measurement system was developed to measure the vibration transmitted to the seated subjects' head. These experiments were performed with 12 adult male subjects and the data were analyzed to derive the biodynamic responses in terms of seat-to-head transmissibility (STHT), total apparent mass measured at the seat pan, cross-axis apparent mass of the upper body reflected at the back support. The results attained were used to characterize the roles of various contributing factors, such as back support condition, hands position and excitation magnitude. The results reveal the non-linearities in the APMS and STHT responses. The results of the ANOVA further show the strong influences of the three back support conditions on both vertical and fore-and-aft STHT responses over the entire frequency ranges. The vertical APMS magnitudes in the vicinity of the secondary resonance tend to be higher for the back supported postures. The mechanical equivalent models of the seated body are further attempted on the basis of observed biodynamic responses. Owing to the significant effects of the back support conditions, one-and two-dimensional models are formulated to simulate the APMS and STHT responses for all three back support conditions. The target datasets, however, are limited to those representing mean body mass of 75.58 kg in the excitation of 1m/s 2 rms acceleration (0.5-15 Hz). A 4-DOF one-dimensional model is developed using simultaneously measured vertical APMS and STHT response. The model parameters are identified for the three back support conditions respectively to emphasize the significance of back support conditions. The model parameter analysis suggest that both the force-motion and motion-motion measures need to be satisfied in order to obtain a more reliable model parameter set. The two-dimensional 5-DOF model allows for the consideration of the upper body interactions with the inclined backrest support. The identified models show good agreements with the measured target responses in APMS measured at the seat pan and the backrest, and vertical STHT. The model validity is further demonstrated in terms of the absorbed power property of the seated body. Considering that the physical responses of the tissues are more directly related to localized responses, alternate methods that can predict the distributed absorbed power property in body segment are realized in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional models</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical modeling of the cold spray process</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Song Zhu, Qing</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis involves numerical modeling of several cold spray processes in order to predict the gas flow as well as the particle conditions upon impacting on a substrate. Particle normal velocity was found to be the most important factor to improve the deposition efficiency and coating quality. Particle velocity was calculated with both Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches. The Lagrangian approach was used to investigate the effect of particle size and substrate geometry in a dilute particle flow. The shape and strength of the bow shock formed near the substrate for different geometries (such as concave, convex, and flat) were studied. Consequently, the particle normal velocities impacting on the substrates located at various stand-off distances were calculated. Furthermore, the numerical simulations were repeated with particles of various sizes as well as different types of feeding gas. The results were compared to obtain the optimum substrate location and the appropriate particle size for each feeding gas. The numerical results were validated against the experimental results for the majority of the process parameters including the gas Mach number and mean particle velocity. The Eulerian approach was also implemented to model dense particulate flows. It was found that a dense particulate flow could significantly decelerate the gas flow and consequently result in small particle velocity.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Influence of surface geometry and heating on the flow structure in wall-bounded flows</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Gajusingh, Shivani Tara</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The present research is aimed at improving the knowledge and understanding of the physical processes that control heat transfer across the solid-fluid interface, which is very important in order to develop efficient heat exchangers. To achieve this objective, the research has been divided into three phases, which investigated the fundamental physical phenomena from different aspects. The first phase provided the first detailed investigation of the impact of different wall roughness on the turbulent properties in a smooth channel. The results show the different wall roughness has significant effects on the mean streamwise velocity and Reynolds stress distribution. For other turbulent properties, the enhancement was observed near the rough wall, however, it was restricted to the inner region. The second phase provided the first quantitative comparison of the mean and turbulent properties in the presence and absence of wall heating under same operating conditions. The results show that both mean and turbulent characteristics are affected by wall heating. The results also showed that an originally laminar flow becomes turbulent with the addition of heat. However for an originally turbulent flow, addition of heat reduces the magnitudes of the mean streamwise velocity and turbulent properties. The third phase provided the first detailed comparison on the turbulent characteristics with and without a baffle. The results showed a significant enhancement of all turbulent characteristics in the region downstream of the baffle. These results demonstrate that higher turbulence produced by a baffle would be responsible for the enhanced heat transfer rate at the wall</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Numerical investigation of the flow between two stationary parallel discs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Soroardy, Jomir Uddin</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Steady, incompressible turbulent sink flows that develop between two stationery discs with and without swirl were investigated numerically using the software FLUENT 6.1 with the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) employed to approximate turbulence. The main purpose of the work is to validate the method and then elaborate on some key features of these types of flows. Both problems studied here were characterized by severe streamline bending. Exploratory tests using the k - [varepsilon] methodology reconfirmed that it is not suitable for flows of these type. Instead, the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) with five equations for 2D geometry and 7 equations for 3D to accurately resolved the physics of the problems well. Furthermore, the continuative rather the pressure boundary condition yielded stable solutions. Care however had to be applied in selecting the length of the outlet manifold. The basic idea was to avoid the vena contracta after the ninety-degree bend by increasing the length of the exit pipe. The obtained numerical results are shown to be in accord with past experiments throughout the entire domain. The technique is able to resolve, at a satisfactory level, the flow development even at known problematic areas such as for example near the sink exit. Acceleration was found to be the primary controlling factor for both purely radial and swirling inflow where monotonic changes of pressure gradient are a common manifestation. For uni-radial sink flow, inertia increase either due to inlet velocity augmentation or decrease of the local area produces flatter velocity profiles thus suggesting that inertia reigns over the viscous forces. In the case of swirling inflow, the overpowering centrifugal force field forced almost all of the fluid to be drained through the Ekman's boundary layers developed on each of the disk surface. It now becomes clear that the growth of flow near the disk or spikes in the radial velocity is due to the combined action of boundary layer development and local reduction of the flow area. The numerical algorithm was also able, for the first time, to successfully capture the toroidal recirculation zone that is known to inhabit the central portion of the flow. The latter is also responsible for the development of a reversed flow, which causes the saddle-like behavior of the radial velocity near the mid-plane. The tangential velocity peaks near the disks known from previous experiments and numerical formulations appeared also in the current solutions. Therefore, the present study has validated a tool that can now be used to provide answers to some outstanding questions. It can be employed to provide an insight into the stabilizing effects of acceleration which encourages the flow to remain laminar even at very high inlet Reynolds numbers, or to laminarize in case that the entering flow is turbulent. It could also provide the limits of validity of the previous simple models</dc:description>

          <dc:creator>Naccache, Rafik</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The luminescence properties of singly-doped Pr 3+ and Pr 3+ /Yb 3+ co-doped nanocrystalline gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG, Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 ) are investigated. Dominant blue/green emission emanating from the 3 P 0 [arrow right] 3 H 4 and 3 P 0 [arrow right] 3 H 6 transitions was observed after excitation using a wavelength of 457.9 nm. The luminescence properties of the nanocrystals were compared to the bulk material (single crystal) with identical Pr 3+ concentrations (1 mol%) and no noticeable shift in peak position was observed. Increasing the Pr 3+ concentration in the nanocrystals resulted in a decrease in 3Po and 3P, emission to lower lying states via the [ 3 P 0 , 3 H 4 ] [arrow right] [ 3 H 6 , 1 D 2 ] cross relaxation (CR) mechanism. Furthermore, a decrease in the 1 D 2 emission was observed and was attributed to the [ 1 D 2 , 3 H 4 ] [arrow right] [ 1 G 4 , 3 F 3,4 ] CR mechanism. The increase in CR efficiency was attributed to the smaller interionic distances between the dopant ions. Continuous wave excitation into the 1 D 2 level of the Pr 3+ ion at 606.9 nm transition produced blue upconversion luminescence. Based on the increase in transition lifetimes, an energy transfer (ET) upconversion mechanism was proposed. Furthermore, weak blue, green and red upconversion emission was observed from the 3 P 0 , 3 P 1 and 1 D 2 states following excitation into the 1 G 4 energy level with 980 nm. Upconversion was determined to primarily occur through excited state absorption. Co-doping the nanocrystalline GGG:Pr 3+ (1 mol%) samples with Yb 3+ (1-10 mol%) results in a 3-fold increase in upconversion emission intensity relative to the singly doped samples excited under the same conditions (n exc = 980 nm). The observed lifetimes obtained using 457.9 nm excitation suggest back transfer from the Pr 3+ ion to neighboring Yb 3+ ions which results in decrease in room temperature visible emission and upconversion luminescence.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Modeling and Characterization of X-ray Image Detectors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Mahmood, Shaikh Asif</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The flat-panel image detectors capture an X-ray image electronically, and enable a smooth clinical transition to digital radiography by replacing traditional film/cassette based system. They provide excellent X-ray images and have been commercialized for different X-ray imaging modalities. However, there still remain significant scientific challenges in these detectors associated with dark current and ghosting which constitute critical performance requirements for modalities such as digital fluoroscopy. This doctoral dissertation involves both experimental characterization and physics-based theoretical modelling of time and bias dependent dark current behaviour and X-ray induced change in sensitivity (ghosting) in X-ray imaging detectors. The theoretical investigations are based on the physics of the individual phenomenon and a systematic solution of physical equations in the photoconductor layer; (i) semiconductor continuity equations (ii) Poisson’s equation, and (iii) trapping rate equations. The theoretical model has been validated with the measured and published experimental results. The developed dark current model has been applied to a-Se and poly-HgI2 based detectors (direct conversion detectors), and a-Si:H p-i-n photodiode (indirect conversion detectors). The validation of the model with the experimental results determines the physical mechanisms responsible for the dark current in X-ray imaging detectors. The dark current analysis also unveils the important material parameters such as trap center concentrations in the blocking layers, trap depths, and effective barrier heights for injecting carriers. The analysis is important for optimization of the dark current consistent with having good transport properties which can ultimately improve the dynamic range of the detector. The physical mechanisms of sensitivity reduction (ghosting) and its recovery has been investigated by exposing a-Se detector at high dose and then monitoring the recovery process under (i) resting the samples (natural recovery), (ii) reversing the bias polarity and magnitude, and (iii) shining light. The continuous monitoring of the sensitivity as a function of exposure and time reveals the ghosting mechanisms in a-Se mammography detectors. This research finds a faster sensitivity recovery by reversing the bias during the natural recovery process. The sensitivity recovery mechanisms (e.g., recombination between trapped and oppositely charged free carrier, trapping of oppositely charged free carriers, or relaxation of trap centers) have been qualitatively investigated by validating the simulation results with the experimental data. The ghost removal mechanisms and techniques are important to improve the image quality which can ultimately lead to the reduction of the patient exposure consistent with better diagnosis for different X-ray imaging modalities.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental and Numerical Investigation of Mass Transfer in Passive Scaled-up Micromixers</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Cook, Kristina J.</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Micromixers are vital components in micro-total analysis systems (μ-TAS) and Lab-on-Chip (LOC) devices, with applications in drug delivery, medical diagnostics, and chemical analyses, amongst others. Traditional macroscale mixing techniques may not be applied at the microscale, where viscous forces become important compared to inertial forces. As such, it remains a challenge to effectively and thoroughly mix liquid species in small characteristic dimensions. The present work aims to analyze flow phenomena and mass transfer in three novel scaled-up micromixers, which make use of variations in channel geometry to induce mixing. Designs based on multi-lamination inlets, obstruction filled channels, Dean vortex inducing curved channels, and helical flow inducing grooves are investigated. Flow visualization is used as a qualitative tool, providing valuable information regarding flow patterns and mixing. Induced fluorescence is applied to assess whole field concentration distribution, and provide quantitative species distribution data. Complex three dimensional flows are analyzed using numerical simulations, which show good agreement with experimental work. The mixers are evaluated over Reynolds numbers ranging from 0.5 to 100, corresponding to Péclet numbers ranging from 1.25 × 103 to 1.25 × 105. Results show a decreasing-increasing trend in the degree of mixing with increasing Reynolds number, as the dominant mixing mechanism changes from mass diffusion to mass advection. Up to 90% mixing is reported. To allow for reasonable mixing performance comparison with published work, an equivalent length parameter is proposed. The present devices offer good mixing in shorter lengths over a wide range of Reynolds numbers compared to numerous published devices.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>CFD Modelling of Turbulent Flow in Open-Channel Expansions</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Najmeddin, Sahar</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Channel expansions provide a transition from a narrow to a relatively wide channelsection, which is necessary in many hydraulic structures. In the transition, flow tends to separate from its diverging sidewalls and create turbulent eddies, if the angle of divergence exceeds a threshold value. This phenomenon can cause undesirable flow energy losses and erosion to the sidewalls locally and even further downstream. Previously, researchers have tried to optimise the transition’s horizontal shape in order to reduce flow separation; the results are inconclusive. The purpose of this study is to extend earlier investigations about fitting a hump in the vertical to eliminate flow separation. This study uses the CFD modelling approach. This approach permits an efficient and systematic exploration of the effects of different angles of divergence, crest height of the hump and the Froude number of subcritical flow. The model results are validated using existent analytical solutions under simplified conditions and available experimental data for a limited number of cases. Flow quantities presented in this thesis include details of the velocity, vorticity, eddy structure, and cross-sectional area of flow reversal; these quantities are distributed at selected vertical and horizontal planes, and are available for the cases of with and without a hump. It is shown that the use of a hump effectively reduces flow separation and eddy motion in the transition. This is because the flow is forced to accelerate over the hump, and as a result, the otherwise adverse pressure gradient, which is known to be responsible for flow separation, diminishes. A hump in the vertical can easily be incorporated into the bed of existent channel expansions, and would be less expensive to construct than to modify the horizontal shape (or the sidewalls) of existent expansions. The results presented in this thesis are of practical values for the optimal design of humps.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Higgs and Radion Phenomenology Beyond the Standard Model</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Korutlu, Beste</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In this thesis we study models Beyond the Standard Model including Left-Right Supersymmetric Model and Warped Extra Dimensional Models with a Fourth Generation. First, we revisit the Higgs sector of Left-Right Supersymmetric Model by studying the scalar potential in a version of the model in which the minimum is the charge and R-parity conserving vacuum state, and there are no additional non-renormalizable terms in the Lagrangian. We try to �nd a parameter space predicting at least one light doubly-charged Higgs boson, light neutral avor-conserving Higgs bosons. The Flavor-violating ones are heavy, and within the limits from Delta F = 1,2 mixings. The parameter space for such Higgs masses and mixings is very restrictive, thus making the model more predictive. Subsequently, we study warped extra-dimensional scenarios in the presence of a fourth family of fermions and with the fermion fields lying in the bulk. We concentrate on the flavor structure of the Higgs couplings with fermions in the flavor anarchy ansatz. The occupancy of the fourth family in the model typically enhances the misalignment effects and we show that one should expect them to be highly nonsymmetrical in the (34) inter-generational mixing. The radiative corrections from the new fermions and their flavor violating couplings to the Higgs aff ect negligibly known experimental precision measurements such as the oblique parameters and Z -&gt; b \bar{b}or Z -&gt; mu^ +mu^-. On the other hand, Delta F = 1, 2 processes, mediated by tree-level Higgs exchange, as well as radiative corrections to b -&gt; s gamma and mu to e gamma put some pressure on the allowed size of the flavor violating couplings. These couplings produce distinguishable signals in high energy colliders as they alter the Higgs decay patterns as well as those of the new fermions. These signals might become very important indirect signals for these type of models as they would be present even when the Kaluza-Klein mass scale is high and no heavy Kaluza-Klein particle is dicovered. Afterwards, we focus on the radion phenomenology in the same scenario with and without an additional fourth family of fermions. The radion couplings with the fermions are also generically misaligned with respect to the Standard Model fermion mass matrices as in the Higgs case, therefore producing some amount of flavor violating couplings and potentially influencing production and decay rates of the radion. We present simple analytic expressions for the radion-fermion couplings with three or four families. We also update and analyze the current experimental limits on radion couplings and on the model parameters. The modi�ed decay branching ratios of the radion with an emphasis on the new channels involving flavor diagonal and flavor violating decays into fourth generation quarks and leptons are provided. Finally, we study the Higgs-radion mixing in a warped extra dimensional model in the same scenario. The fourth generation Higgs is now severely constrained by Large Hadron Collider data due to the large enhancement in the Higgs production crosssection in the absence of Higgs-radion mixing. We analyze the production and decay rates of the two physical states emerging from the mixing and confront them with present Large Hadron Collider data. We show that the current signals observed can be compatible with the presence of one, or both, of these Higgs-radion mixed states, although with a severely restricted parameter space. We also present the modi�ed decay branching ratios of the mixed Higgs-radion states, including flavor violating decays into fourth generation quarks and leptons. The windows of allowed parameter space obtained are very sensitive to the increased precision of upcoming Large Hadron Collider data. During the present year, a clear picture of this scenario will emerge, either con�rming or further severely constraining this scenario.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Experimental Study of Wind Effects on Unglazed Transpired Collectors</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Vasan, Neetha</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Unglazed transpired collectors (UTC) are one of the most efficient solar heating technologies available today. High wind velocity affects the performance of UTC; indeed, wind flow on the collector’s surface reduces useful heat transferred to the collector fluid by effecting convective heat losses and suction in the pores and thereby outflow from the plenum. Wind does not impinge uniformly on all points on a large area; the velocity distribution depends on wind direction and surroundings. This thesis presents an experimental study in the Building Aerodynamics Laboratory at Concordia University and an analytical parametric study to assess the effect of wind velocity distribution on UTCs under the influence of approach wind direction and surrounding structures. Velocity measurements from wind tunnel experiments were applied to analytical models of UTC performance evaluation. The common assumption, in UTC analysis, that a reference wind velocity acts uniformly over the UTC surface, as opposed to the more realistic non-uniform distribution, has been shown to underestimate the values of convective heat loss coefficients. The study, when applied to the context of the JMSB solar-wall, indicated a reduction of thermal efficiency by 20 percentage points due to wind. Influence of surroundings on wind flow around the JMSB building has been evaluated. The study casts light on the importance of using actual velocity distributions in UTC analysis.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Aerodynamic Inverse Shape Design of Compressor and Turbine Stages Using ANSYS-CFX</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Arbabi, Araz</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>An aerodynamic inverse shape design method is implemented into ANSYS-CFX using a User Defined Function. The implementation is validated first; the method is then assessed on a subsonic axial compressor stage and a turbine stage. The design method is based on specifying a target pressure distribution over the blade suction surface (or a target pressure loading) and a blade thickness distribution as the design variables. The blade wall moves with a fictitious velocity, which is derived from a balance of design and target momentum fluxes, in order to reach a blade shape that would produce the prescribed target pressure distribution. The wall movement obtained from the design method is computed in a User Defined Function through the CFX Expression Language; it is then communicated to ANSYS-CFX at each time step. In ANSYS-CFX, a cell-centered finite volume formulation is used for space discretization. The time accurate Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations are written in an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) form so as to account for the wall and mesh movement. The k- turbulence model is used for both compressor and turbine stages. Once the UDF is validated, ANSYS-CFX is used to redesign the E/CO-3 axial compressor stage and the E/TU-3 axial turbine stage so as to improve the stage aerodynamic performance.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Discharge characteristics of V-shaped multi-slit weirs</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ji, Kai</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>V-shaped weirs with small angles are efficient in accurately measuring extremely small discharge rates. The concept of slit weirs to measure discharge rates has been studied in recent investigations. Rectangular multi-slit notches or weirs have been shown to extend the range of flow measurement to include both very low and high discharge rates. It is a well-known fact that V-notches whose sections are narrower at lower heads are preferred to rectangular notches to measure small discharge rates in laboratories. To increase the range of discharges measured, the concept of multi-slit weirs using rectangular weirs has been introduced recently. For rectangular multi-slit weirs, experimental data showed that the discharge coefficient C d for multi-slit weirs or a single weir was a function of the Reynolds number R e when R e is based on the width of rectangular weirs. V-notches are generally used for laboratory flow measurements, as they can very precisely measure discharge rates. Hence, the multi-slit weirs formed by V-notches are expected to measure discharges in a very wide range of discharge rates. To represent a common discharge coefficient C d for multi-slit weirs formed of either rectangular or triangular shaped individual weirs, a new Reynolds number R eR is proposed to unify representation of discharge coefficient data for both rectangular shaped and V-shaped multi-slit weir units. C d data for both rectangular and V-shaped multi-slit weirs fall on a single curve and appear to be the function of R eR . At large Reynolds number, R eR , the discharge coefficient C d approaches a constant value of 0.61. This constant also denotes the contraction coefficient for the narrow two-dimensional slit flow. Present test data show that C d for multi-slit V-shaped weirs is generally a function of R eR for b/B &lt;0.3. Here, R eR is based on the hydraulic radius R and b is the value of top flow width of the water passing the multi-slit weirs. A very limited number of numerical simulations are also performed to determine discharge coefficient ( C d ) and the water surface profiles for the multi-slit V-shaped weirs. The predictions related to the surface profile based on the numerical model are validated by experimental data. The three-dimensional (3D) two-equation standard k- [varepsilon] turbulence model together with the volume of fluid VOF tracking technique is effectively used to obtain a few simulation results that are limited in scope</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Characterization of insulator layers in magnetic tunneling junctions with applications in memory devices</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Ren, Ciwei</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Magnetic tunnel junctions ( MTJ s) are electrical devices that display a large change in resistance when an external magnetic field applied to the junctions. MTJ s have applications in non-volatile memory element in Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM). MTJ is composed of two ferromagnetic metallic electrodes and one insulating layer. The insulating layer is inserted in between the two electrodes. When a voltage is applied between the two electrodes, a tunneling current will flow through the insulating layer. An applied magnetic field can change the current direction due to influences on ferromagnetic material causing a change in resistance. The tunneling magnetoresistance ( TMR ) is a measure of the sensitivity of the device to magnetic fields. It is common that an aluminium oxide ( Al 2 O 3 ) tunneling barrier, which is made by oxidation of a thin layer of aluminium ( Al ), is used in most MTJ s design. Several oxidation processes have been applied to achieve high quality barrier layers. Typical processes are oxidations in atmosphere, in a pure oxygen environment, oxygen reactive sputtering and RF plasma. By applying these techniques, several groups have reported the TMR ratios greater than 30%. The main disadvantage of these processes is that the oxidation rate is very fast, and usually it takes not more than 1{598}40 seconds to complete the oxidation. It is difficult to control the thickness of oxidation layer, which yields an Al 2 O 3 layer either under-oxidized or over-oxidized. Aluminium nitride ( AlN ) is an insulating material which can take the place of Al 2 O 3 in these devices. The nitridation process of Al films is expected to progress much slower than the oxidation process of Al films, due to the lower diffusion coefficient of nitrogen in the insulating layer compare to that of oxygen. The research objective of this work is to investigate the effect of nitridation of the insulator layers in MTJ devices. For this, different methods are used to nitridize the insulator layer which is chosen to be as a thin layer of Al. The effect of post-processing annealing is also studied. The tunneling junction resistances versus external magnetic field, and tunneling junction I{598}V characteristic for different samples were measured, compared and discussed. Finally, conclusions are made to compare these techniques with those already available in practise</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Investigation of thermal and flow fields above and below the air-water interface during natural convection</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Bukhari, Syed Junaid Kamran</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Present dissertation describes the turbulent convection in horizontal layers of air and water separated by an evaporative shear-free water surface during natural convection. A detailed analysis of the hydrodynamic turbulent structure on water and air sides is presented in this study. The major portion of the research comprised of experimental investigation in addition to simulation of simultaneous airside and waterside velocity fields. The experimental measurements were made using non-intrusive state-of-the-art techniques, namely particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) for instantaneous measurements of velocity and temperature fields, respectively. The numerical study shows organized bulk vortical motions on air and water sides. The results also show that for unstable thermal stratification the magnitude of the airside velocities is an order of magnitude higher than the waterside velocities. The experimental results show that the water and air flow fields undergo three-dimensional flow interactions which form complex flow patterns. A detailed spectral analysis has been performed to investigate the temporal and spatial scales of turbulent motions induced during natural convection. The wavenumber and frequency spectra showed the existence of two distinct power law regimes. In low wavenumber (100 rad/m &lt; k &lt; 800 rad/m) and low frequency (0.06 Hz &lt; f &lt; 0.8 Hz) ranges, the spectra exhibit -3 slopes providing the first evidence of the existence of the buoyancy subrange in the waterside flow field during natural convection, where the energy loss is due to the work against buoyancy. At higher wavenumbers and frequencies, the inertial subrange with the classical slope of -5/3 is observed. The results also show that the scaling parameters proposed for wall-bounded natural convection are also suitable for natural convection across evaporative air-water interface. The average temperature profiles show a characteristic boundary layer distribution in the near surface region with an extensive core of constant temperature in the bulk. The temperature profiles within the conduction layer are found to be in good agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results. The present results show z -1 dependency in the thermal source layer and z -1/3 dependency in the bulk region away from the interface which are in good agreement with the past theoretical analysis.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Impact of Raman crosstalk and relative intensity noise transfer on RF overlay in optical passive networks</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Yang, Hong Feng</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In the thesis, we investigate and analyze the impact of Raman crosstalk and RIN transfer on RF video overlay channels induced by 1490-nm optical intensity modulated digital data channel, considering modulation formats of non-return-to-zero (NRZ), return-to-zero (RZ), Inverse-RZ (IRZ), and Manchester coding, fiber length, optical power, optical modulation index and fiber polarization mode dispersion (PMD). Firstly, carrier to noise ration (CNR) degradation due to the worst and best Raman crosstalk due to the Raman crosstalk is compared for NRZ, RZ, inverse RZ and Manchester. It is found that Raman crosstalk is reduced significantly when inverse RZ or Manchester is used, in contrast to NRZ and RZ. By comparing the result of CNR degradation in a real fiber with PMD, it is found that orthogonal polarization state setting at fiber input is still helpful in the reduction of Raman crosstalk for NRZ and RZ, but hardly for inverse RZ and Manchester, if fiber length is less than 15 km, and otherwise useless due to PMD of fiber. Also, relative intensity noise (RIN) transfer induced CNR degradation is analyzed and is too small to be considered.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Dynamic deformation of uniform elastic two-layer objects</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Song, Miao</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis presents a two-layer uniform facet elastic object for real-time simulation based on physics modeling method. It describes the elastic object procedural modeling algorithm with particle system from the simplest one-dimensional object, to more complex two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects. The double-layered elastic object consists of inner and outer elastic mass spring surfaces and compressible internal pressure. The density of the inner layer can be set different from the density of the outer layer; the motion of the inner layer can be opposite to the motion of the outer layer. These special features, which cannot be achieved by a single layered object, result in improved imitation of a soft body, such as tissue's liquidity non-uniform deformation. The construction of the double-layered elastic object is closer to the real tissue's physical structure. The inertial behavior of the elastic object is well illustrated in environments with gravity and collisions with walls, ceiling, and floor. The collision detection is defined by elastic collision penalty method and the motion of the object is guided by the Ordinary Differential Equation computation. Users can interact with the modeled objects, deform them, and observe the response to their action in real time.</dc:description>
